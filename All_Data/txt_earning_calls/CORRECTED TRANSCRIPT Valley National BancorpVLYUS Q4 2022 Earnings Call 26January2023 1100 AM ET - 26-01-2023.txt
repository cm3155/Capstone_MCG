Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. I have a few comments to make this morning, and
then we have Tom to provide insight on the quarter's loan and deposit results. Mike will then discuss the financial
results in more detail.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, Valley reported net income of $178 million, earnings per share of $0.34, and an
annualized ROA of 1.25%. Exclusive of non-core charges, adjusted net income, EPS and ROA, were $183
million, $0.35, and 1.29%, respectively.
In 2022, we generated net income of $569 million and adjusted net income of $650 million. This represents a
significant increase from 2021 as a result of strong organic loan growth, the acquisition of Bank Leumi USA, and
the benefits of higher interest rates that were realized for the majority of the year. I am extremely proud of Valley's
consistent financial performance throughout my tenure as CEO. Our profitability metrics and earnings per share
have increased steadily across a variety of economic and competitive backdrops.
Despite the negative impact of interest rates on equity in 2022 and completing the largest acquisition in our
company's history, our focus on tangible book value resulted in year-over-year growth. In fact, our stated tangible
book value has increased 36% since 2017. This compares to a 14% increase for our proxy peers over the same
period and a 14% increase for Valley between 2012 and 2017. Our value creation, as measured by tangible book
value plus the dividends we have paid, has totaled 72% since 2017. This is over 1.5 times our proxy peer median
of 47%. We have generated real franchise value on both an absolute and relative basis.
Within the context of our sustained financial success, I want to focus this morning on what I see as our key
accomplishments over the last five years and how the evolution of our company positions us for the years ahead.
From a balance sheet perspective, we have done a tremendous job diversifying our funding base. At the end of
2017, approximately 92% of our deposits were held in retail branches. By focusing on commercial relationships in
both niche and digital deposit channels, only 70% of our deposits are from the branch network today. From a
geographic perspective, 78% of our total deposits were in New Jersey or New York branches in 2017. Today, that
number is down to just 48% of total deposits. Finally, despite a challenging few quarters, CDs and borrowings
comprise just 23% of funding today versus 31% five years ago.
Our focus on geographic diversity and a holistic approach to commercial relationships has benefited the asset
side of our business as well. In 2017, 78% of our loan portfolio was in New York and New Jersey. Currently, less
than 60% of our loan portfolio is in these states. The ongoing addition of higher-yielding and increasingly
adjustable loans has helped to better align our asset and liability betas. In our view, this increased balance should
help to reduce the net interest margin volatility that we have experienced in prior cycles.
Ultimately, our sustained credit excellence provides a stable foundation upon which the aforementioned
transformation could occur. Our premier asset quality will continue to be the hallmark of our organization. This
credit strength is the result of both stringent underwriting criteria and a focus on holistic relationships with wealthy
and sophisticated commercial clients.
Heading into 2023, we have not identified any underlying trends which would indicate meaningful stress on the
loan portfolio. In any event, we believe that our experience during the height of the pandemic indicates the
exceptional resilience of our borrower base.
In aggregate, the balance sheet transformation that we've undergone has been a direct result of our company's
strategic evolution and targeted M&A activity. We have focused on business and geographic diversification,

premier customer service, and establishing a sustainable organic growth engine. Our hiring efforts and tactical
initiatives have aligned with these outcomes, and we feel well-positioned to navigate the near-term operating
environment headwinds that we face today.
Over the long term, we will continue to focus on diversification and sustainable growth. We believe the progress
made over the last five years will drive our continued success and ultimately benefit our associates, customers
and external stakeholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza
President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Slide 6 illustrates the quarter's 15% annualized loan growth. While quarterly loan originations
remain below peak levels, net growth continues to benefit from slower payoffs and more sustained activity on the
residential and consumer side. Our commercial loan growth remains well-diversified across asset classes and
geographies. We continue to experience significant repeat business from our longstanding and sophisticated
commercial borrowers. Legacy Leumi customers have also benefited from the utilization of our more robust
product set and balance sheet resources.
We anticipate that customer demand will wane somewhat in 2023, largely due to the impact of higher interest
rates. Still, we are well-positioned from a competitive perspective to capture high-single-digit loan growth for the
year. Our continued focus on attracting and retaining top talent and preserving service excellence positions us
well despite a potentially more challenging backdrop.
On slide 6, you can also see the 99-basis-point increase in average new origination yields to 6.2% during the
quarter. We remain successful in passing rate hikes through to our customers and anticipate further expansion in
origination yields in the near term. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our loan portfolio is fixed and another
20% reprices over a period beyond 30 days. These pockets should provide a repricing tailwind that will continue
to support increasing portfolio yields as rate hikes slow.
Before moving on to the deposit side, I wanted to provide some additional color on the quarter's net charge-offs.
Approximately $21 million of the quarter's charge-offs were related to a single C&I loan. Both legacy Valley and
Leumi has participated in this larger syndicated credit. Our combined loan exposure had previously been
classified as nonaccrual, and the remaining exposure is fully reserved for as of 12/31/2022. This is a discrete
credit event and the vast majority of our portfolio continues to perform extremely well. And as Ira mentioned, our
underlying credit trends remain very strong.
Turning to slide 7, you can see that deposits grew at an annualized rate of approximately 21% during the quarter.
While the quarter's net growth was largely funded by brokered alternatives, we are pleased with our ability to
effectively defend our traditional deposit base in this challenging environment. While we saw noninterest deposit
pressure across business lines, the largest single driver of the quarter's reduction occurred in our technology
deposit area. Despite the volatility of this business, which has been exacerbated by certain environmental
challenges, we continue to add customers and accounts and anticipate above average growth over time. As a
reminder, our technology deposits contribute approximately 5% of our total balances.
As we indicated last quarter, we are experiencing competition for deposit sources across the franchise.
Specifically on the commercial side, the same wealthy and sophisticated customer base that supports our strong

and consistent credit performance has been actively requesting competitive deposit rates. This has incrementally
pressured our betas and deposit costs.
Our retail network has been responsive to our CD offerings, and both digital and cannabis deposits saw solid
growth during the quarter. We are keenly aware of the price competition that we face to defend and grow our
deposit balances. A variety of channels remain available to us. And we will do our best to take advantage of the
most cost effective alternatives to support our continued loan growth.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarter's financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Slide 8 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. Net interest
income increased approximately $12 million or 3% from the linked quarter. This reflects continued loan growth
and expanding loan yields, which were partially offset by more robust interest bearing deposit growth and funding
cost pressures.
While our fourth quarter fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 3.57% from the third
quarter of 2022, our PPP adjusted margin remains 47 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2021.
During the quarter, a 69 basis point expansion in our asset yield was more than offset by a 78 basis point
increase in total funding costs. The asset yield increase was driven by both the repricing of our floating rate loans
and the significant increase in the yields on newly originated loans.
During the quarter, we funded loan growth and our non-interest bearing deposit run off, primarily with higher cost
time deposits. As you saw on slide 7, we calculate accumulative year-to-date deposit beta of approximately 34%.
As we noted last quarter, deposit competition has accelerated rapidly and we have had to offer higher rates to
attract funds to support our significant loan growth. While we continue to benefit from asset repricing, this is likely
to be more than offset by higher funding costs in 2023.
Moving to slide 9. We generated just under $53 million of non-interest income for the quarter as compared to
$56.2 million in the third quarter. The reduction was primarily the result of lower swap income. This was partially
offset by stronger revenues from our trust, wealth, and insurance businesses. We anticipate that our 2023 fee
income could grow at a mid to high-single digit pace using the fourth quarter annualized number as a starting
point.
On slide 10, you can see that are noninterest expenses were approximately $266 million for the quarter or
approximately $256 million on an adjusted basis. Most expense lines were well-controlled during the quarter, and
the modest increase from the third quarter levels was partially the result of higher counterparty collateral fees
related to certain hedging activities. Continued revenue growth helped drive our efficiency ratio to 49.3% from
49.8% in the third quarter. We anticipate sustaining a sub-50% efficiency ratio in 2023 and believe there will be
opportunities to drive efficiency lower from our current level.
Turning to slide 11, you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. Tom detailed the single loan
relationship that drove the spike in net charge-offs for the quarter. We believe this was an isolated incident and
are pleased with our aggregate 5 basis point net charge-offs to average loan rate for 2022. As a result of
continued improvement in our underlying credit metrics and stability in the economic forecast, our allowance for
credit losses as a percent of total loans declined to 1.03% at December 31, from 1.10% at September 30. As a

percentage of nonaccrual loans, the allowance increased to 170% from 162% at September 30 and 150% one
year ago.
On slide 12, you can see the tangible book value increased approximately 3.4% for the quarter. This was the
result of our strong earnings and a modest improvement in the OCI impact associated with our available for sale
securities portfolio. Tangible common equity to tangible assets improved slightly as a result of the same factors.
Our regulatory capital ratio has declined modestly during the quarter, as a result of our strong loan growth. We
anticipate that growth will moderate in 2023, resulting in higher regulatory capital levels a year from now.
We lay out additional 2023 guidance items on slide 13. For simplicity, we based our forecast on 2022 full year
results, which only included three quarters of impact from Bank Leumi. Based on our current pipeline and
expectations for a modest pullback in demand, we anticipate 2023 loan growth of 7% to 9%. This would result in
net interest income growth of 16% to 18%. We anticipate approximately 10.5% to 12.5% growth in expenses
using 2022 reported less merger charges as a starting point. This would imply a full year efficiency ratio at or
below the mid-49% level posted this quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I want to start drilling down on the margin a little bit. Appreciate the guide and the outlook and obviously a strong
kind of end to the year. I'm just curious, though, I mean, I imagine you guys are assuming some more beta
pressure on the funding side in the first half of the year. But as we think about the thought process around a
relatively stable NIM for 2023 and asset yield improvements being offset by funding improvements, are you guys
also factoring in continued outflow on the noninterest bearing side, or how are you guys thinking about mix
because obviously, Ira, your point is well taken about how much the business has structurally changed. But is
there still some kind of normalization to be had just from the environment that we're coming out of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And I think it's a good question, and I'll turn some of the mechanics over to Mike. But I do want to re-highlight
once again the macro change that we have in the funding base today. And especially just out of that retail

footprint, I know historically the Northeast has been high on an absolute basis, as well as high on a beta basis
and to now have 48% of our deposits just sitting in New York, New Jersey region versus 78% before is
dramatically going to change what the overall beta performance is.
But Mike [indiscernible] (00:18:24) some more details, I believe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think the thing to really keep in mind is we saw $900 million roughly rotate out of noninterest bearing into
interest bearing between third and fourth quarter. And our expectation right now as we look into 2023 is that that
will continue and hopefully it bottoms out into the high 20-ish type range. The reason that we think that is we bank
a fairly sophisticated, wealthy customer base and obviously we pass the line where they're going to leave excess
deposits in noninterest bearing. Also, keep in mind that with that $900 million that rotated, we also had about
$700 million of excess – with that in quotation marks – deposits that we put on in the fourth quarter in anticipation
of the Fed's two additional Fed actions increases in the first half of 2023. So we're getting out ahead of that a little
bit. And obviously those have a higher beta attached to them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And I do want to really just add. One of the things that we have done is continue to grow the commercial book as
well. If you look at a year-over-year basis, we've seen business checking account increase 11%. And obviously
those have a lot of operating accounts associated with them. So there really isn't as much excess deposits in
some of those. So while there is pressure, I do believe some of the changes and focuses that we've had in the
strategic areas are really going to inure to the benefit throughout 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. So taking that kind of all into context, it's fair to say that at this point, when you guys are kind of guiding
towards a stable-ish NIM, you could kind of conservatively assuming that some of the headwinds that occurred in
the fourth quarter continue to occur in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Mike. I think when you think about – this is Travis, when you think about our 7% to 9% loan growth guide
and when you kind of take the fourth quarter run rate on NII and you figure out where the guide that were giving
you is for 2023, you'll see kind of closer to 4% NII growth. So, we're anticipating some amount of margin
compression. And don't forget too, the first quarter, obviously we'll have additional headwinds like the day count
issue is going to cost us a couple of basis points there...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Correct, yeah.

...as well. So, yeah, I don't think we're guiding necessarily to a stable margin. I would say that if you factor it all
together, there's a little bit of pressure that's baked in here and it's because of the factors that we've talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. Okay, great. Thanks, Travis. And then secondly, Ira, on the efficiency ratio and – I guess just kind of a
philosophical question but I mean, do you think sub-50 is kind of the new table stakes? I mean, as you guys try to
manage your business from an investment standpoint and an ROI standpoint in terms of like incremental margins
[indiscernible] (00:21:08) business customers and stuff. I guess the question is this just the way we should be
thinking about your business base case moving forward irregardless of where rates are? Yeah, I guess I'll just
leave it there. I'm curious what your thoughts are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I'd be disappointed if we run about 50% on a consistent basis. I believe even our forecast for this year continues
to invest in strategic, and this is really going to continue to drive franchise value for us. I think we focus on
expenses probably too much in certain areas. If you go back to when I took over as CEO, we had 3,325
employees and $29 billion of assets the first quarter thereafter.
Today, we're sitting with $57 billion of assets, 3,826 employees. So we've had added 501 employees over the five
years and grown the bank $28 billion. And there's tremendous focus here on efficiencies, process and making
sure that we're getting the most out of every single dollar that we spend on the expense side. I think – but to your
point, we have to build franchise value. We are investing in our future of certain businesses that we think are
going to continue to really grow and so the outsized performance. So it is a balance for us. But managing the
macro number, I think, is something that's really important to everyone here within the organization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful perspective. And then just I think one last one in and then I'll drop back. Just the trust and investment fees
were stronger than I was looking for, at least in the quarter. And I was just curious if you could maybe remind us
what the fee structures there look like and depending like, are they market dependent, or are they more fixed or
just any color there would be great, just to have an idea of what to expect once we make some assumptions for
next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Mike, I think the fourth quarter pick-up was partially related to Dudley, which has some seasonally back-loaded
revenues. So that flows through that trust investment insurance line because of their advisory fees. I do think our
forecast for 2023, we assume that there's some continued improvement in that line in total because should the
equity and debt markets normalize, I think we would look for some improvement in our market based revenues.
So I think that's reasonable. But we don't anticipate a significant – obviously, we're guiding to mid to high-single
digit growth on the fee side, so it's not astronomical.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. And the Dudley, is that seasonal revenue something that you would expect to occur kind of on an
annual basis towards the end of the year?

where is loan pricing these days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
I think when you – it's Thomas, Steve, when you look at our yield in the fourth quarter, we increased that 100
basis points to 6.2%. On a monthly basis, we were just under 6.5% for the month of December. We continue to
push our spreads up to counter the cost of our deposits. It really will differ by asset classes more sort of anything
else. And as Ira mentioned earlier, we're 60% adjustable. So we'll continue to benefit by the rise in short-term
rates on that 40% of our portfolio tied to SOFR prime and LIBOR.

Steve Moss Q

Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the deposit side, you mentioned growth in, I think, tech and cannabis here.

Yeah. Again it's a deposit-driven business for us and we are focusing on the multistate operators. We now do
business with 10 of them. We grow accounts in double-digits on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I don't have an exact

Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
One thing. Steve, this is Travis. We lump cannabis in with a couple of other niche deposit businesses. So for us
that would be cannabis, HOA, national deposits, and digital, in those four businesses in aggregate out of $900
million in deposits during the quarter, which helped to offset some of the other traditional kind of commercial
deposit runoff. And so that goes back to Ira's conversation about the transformation of the bank. Absent those
businesses which are relatively new to Valley, we'd be looking at a different deposit picture.

A question for you on the CD growth during the quarter. Ira, you mentioned it used to be, I think, 31% five years
ago. Do you guys see any limits to that CD growth? Should we expect more of the same in the next quarter or
two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I think you will see slightly higher levels assuming that we have loan growth that's in excess of what our
expectations are in the guidance. And then brokerage CD market is very liquid for us. And we will use it as a tool
to fund up the balance sheet and manage our loan to deposit ratio. But as Travis commented earlier, what's really
important is the growth we're seeing in these other niche sectors, along with the fact that we did do another CD
promotion in the fourth quarter that raised just about $1 billion as well. And while those are higher cost deposits,
as I said earlier, trying to link it back to my earlier comment, we expect those deposits will become cheaper,
assuming that the Fed's expected rate increases occur in the first half of 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And Jon, I mean, I just can't reiterate enough the different levers that we have today that we never historically
had. When we talk about where we used to generate fund income, [indiscernible] (00:28:19) out of the branches.
It came out of the FHLB or it came out of the brokered CD market. Those were the three choices we had.
Today, to even to support the 15% loan growth, we have a litany of additional levers today, and we have the
flexibility that if we wanted to go to the retail CD market because we think that's attractive, then that's where a
portion of it could come from. We have the ability to extend duration on certain things that we've never had before.
So the flexibility that we have today is astronomical compared to where we were before. And I do believe over a
period of time, on a relative basis, that that's going to help us manage our funding cost to a much better degree
than what we were historically able to. And when you look at the asset side of the balance sheet, which they
should be looked at in conjunction with the floating rate assets that we've been able to put on really helps dictate
the types of funding that we want to do across the entire organization. We don't necessarily look at one side of the
balance sheet just in isolation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, it's a unique period, Ira, right? We're in a period of maximum deposit pricing
pressure right now, and I understand that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And then, keep in mind, I think, as Mike was alluding to, we had a 60-plus basis point run-off early, right, because
of the asset sensitivity. So there was an expectation [indiscernible] (00:29:31) we're going to see some increase in
the funding cost that come along with that. But like you said Jon, it's unique, it's interesting right now but there's a
massive franchise value that we're able to build by adding 50% loan growth and be able to [indiscernible]
(00:29:44) the funds to really support that.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Just one quick one on this topic and then I have one other one. But, you mentioned the tech vertical,
the declining deposits there. Was that a surprise? And what drove that? Was it simply making a decision on rate
or was that something else in there? And what was the magnitude of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I won't give you the magnitude of it but I will tell you what caused it. What caused it was one customer in their
portfolio that went IPO. And as a result of that, the bank that took them IPO received the deposits that we
previously had. And that should come as no surprise. That is the life cycle of what happens inside of that tech
business. But overall, our tech balances from the time we started to now are basically flat, when you see most
everybody else in that space have declines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Which I think is a good thing. I mean, if you think about what you've seen from an industry perspective, you've
seen tech deposits come down because of cash burn and needs at the overall individual portfolio companies, this
is a great event, if you think about it from a client perspective that there was IPO and really still even in this
market generate some sizable returns from an investor base. And I think it demonstrates the differentiation of
what our tech business looks like maybe versus what some of the others do from an industry perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay, good. And then maybe this is for you, Mike. I'm not sure but buried in the, in release, there's a
comment about talking about reserves, a lower quantitative factor in the reserves. And I'm just curious, what was
behind that. Was that related to the charge off or was that, that something else that drove that? And then just if
you could give us some thoughts on the provision as well that would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, you're really in the weeds on that one. But the quantitative for the most part, the quantitative adjustment
was not an adjustment based upon economic assumptions because [indiscernible] (00:31:41). So that's probably
what you really want to get at. It's more a function around nuances in various loan pools that we use, kind of
management overlays is the way to think about it.
And then if that's good, on the provision question, all else being equal, we definitely believe that we will be able to
– all else being equal, we'll be able to maintain our current allowance coverage ratio of 1.03%. But it's also
important to note that from the time that we did CECL to where we're at now, we're actually up 14 basis points.
So, we started CECL at 89 basis points, we're at 103 today. And by our math, the peer group is roughly down 20
basis points. So while you've seen massive releases and reductions, we've done the exact opposite. And clearly,
we could have done that if we chose to in the fourth quarter and we chose not to because I think it's prudent going
into this economic environment to try to preserve our allowance or our provision as best we can.

And then maybe just following up on that. I mean just to put it in simplest terms. We didn't leave the reserve,
many of our peers did. So, it's not unlikely that we're not going to have to provide as much if the economy does go
into recession compared to where the peers were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
But just it doesn't feel like you guys are – you're being cautious here, but you're not necessarily seeing the erosion
that maybe we're all fearing is coming later?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think we're being cautious for the last five or six quarters where our economic conditions still had a much more
significant weighting towards a recession than what everybody else did. I find it unfathomable that people would
drain their reserve 20 basis points below CECL for the last – coming out of the pandemic and put it down to 15.
That makes no sense to me. So now where I think that we've been more conservative, it's absolutely more likely
that we're not going to have to build to the level that everybody else is. They should have never dropped down
below CECL from my individual perspective.

I want to start, so first following up on the NII guide, the up 16% to 18% in 2023. Within that guide, what is the

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A

50%. Perfect. And does that – do you assume rate cuts in there, by the way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Hold on one second.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sorry. I just want to clarify, like. So when you look in just for simplistic terms because Mike said it absolutely right,
but for simplistic terms like we wanted to give you the metric that would be comparable to the way we presented
deposit beta in our investor deck. So if you look at that and you rolled that forward to the fourth quarter 2023
based on our rate assumptions, that cumulative deposit beta would be 50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. But do you assume rate cuts in that scenario to get there? What's the underlying rate assumption
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
There is one rate cut, but it's very late in fourth quarter. So I don't think it'll be very impactful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And that's based off of – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
No, no, no. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It's just based off of the current expectation for Fed action. So it's not ours. It's a market-based assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the funding strategy in terms of funding the loan growth in 2023, I'm hearing
somewhat mixed messages, right? You have these lower-cost niches, which helped this quarter but you're relying
more on brokered CDs and CDs. How do you see the mix evolving through 2023, and is it going to skew

materially towards these higher costs or do you think you could keep about the same mix, but because of the
growth you'll get out of the lower-cost verticals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So in our comments, we made a comment around noninterest-bearing rotation that could possibly reduce that
number as a percent of total deposits down to something in the high 20s. So I think the answer to your question
is, yes, we expect a further rotation out of noninterest-bearing. I think that we expect a continued growth in those
niches based upon different aspects that happened with interest rates throughout the year that will help fuel the
loan growth that we expect and fund that loan growth.
But to the extent that those are shortfalls and we don't have enough funding, I think brokered is probably the first
place that we'll go, and we've been doing that. So I think it's just a continuation of demonstrating what we've been
doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So if we put this together and think about the NIM being under pressured, at this point from the 4Q NIM, do
you think it's sort of down fairly consistently quarter-over-quarter through the year? Is it more pronounced in the
first half then you get to some level of stability in the second half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So I think the pressure right now, and nobody has a crystal ball. This is really hard to try to figure this out. I
think the pressure will be more pronounced. There may be some lag, but I think it'll be more pronounced in the
first half of the year and then you'll see a plateauing, hopefully, if in fact the future rate curve is actually realized.
And then, you'll see a plateauing and then maybe later as we said earlier, later in the fourth quarter, you get a
slight reduction that won't be meaningful because of the timing of that cut.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
We recognize how uncertain it is, that's why we're asking so many questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

impact where we are from 4Q going into 1Q. So, I think our comments are acknowledging that when you think

about the pressure we're going to see just in the first quarter, so not all the pressure is really from a funding base,
but just really that day count piece as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Awesome. Got it. And then just one separate question on credit. There's obviously a lot of market concern on
commercial real estate given the rising cap rates. And I'm just curious, looking at the detail that you could provide
on slide 15 of the deck, one, do you share the market's concern over commercial real estate more broad? And
maybe could you drill down if you are concerned, is that a particular geography or a product? I'd love to hear your
commentary on that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Steven, it's Tom. We certainly share the concern of segments of the markets in real estate. We still
continue to see robust growth of people moving into the Southern markets, especially Florida. A lot of our real
estate growth is coming down in that Florida market to support that migration of people down there. As you well
know, we are a very diverse, granular book of business. We don't have a sizable concentration in any segment.
Looking at our real estate portfolio, our average – weighted average loan to value is 62%. Our debt service
coverage is [ph] 1.75 (00:39:10).
So we do look at this very closely. Our cap rates, we've always stressed at higher cap rates than our competitors.
Our average cap rate is around 6.42%, but you'll go through different categories and asset classes. And as an
example, when multifamily cap rates were being – were in the 3%, 4% range, we were stressing at 5.5%. That
allows us to obtain what I will consider lower leverage growth in our markets and keeps down that weighted
average LTV and debt service coverage. And we underwrite to cash flow. We don't underwrite to collateral value.

Hi. Good morning. Had a question on CDs. You noted that customers have been responsive to your CD offerings.
Can you expand on what terms you're putting on? I mean, I know you were selling them out in the past. So has
there been any change in the duration mix, given that we're closer to the Fed holding rate steady or potentially
cutting? And if you could also help us with how much of the CD portfolio will likely – is likely to re-price in the next
couple of quarters?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. This is Mike. So, our retail CD promotions that basically started in the middle part of 2022 and continued
into the fourth quarter have all been around 12- or 18-month duration. So we're not going out long on the curve
because, obviously, related to the answers we gave to earlier questions around our expectation for rates is that
we do expect rates to come down in the very, very end of 2023 and obviously spill over into 2024. We're also
trying to build a fairly flat maturity schedule, so that we don't have any one quarter where you have a lot coming
due so generally, 12 to 18 months.
And we've been very fortuitous on those offerings. So that, while at the time, they might have been a little bit on
the high side, the high beta side, when you look back now where we are with rates after the 425 basis points of
Fed increases, you now look at those as being fairly good funding for us, actually, fairly cheap in some cases.
Now, the one we did in the fourth quarter was obviously on the more expensive side of that. And that's public, so I
can definitely tell you where that was at. That was at 4.5%, and it raised just under $1 billion
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Very helpful. And then, apologies if I missed this, but I think last quarter, it sounded like you were tightening
lending standards a little bit. Can you talk about how you – what are you doing this quarter and how you feel
about [ph] credit (00:42:08) going in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. We consistently look at our lending standards and our criteria, and we began tightening
those standards early on in the pandemic. And to remind everyone, 70% of our business is to our existing
customer base that have been through the ups and downs in the economic cycles. So we manage our – we never
compromise standards to grow. We maintain our standards. And as we've talked about before, we typically use
higher cap rates to evaluate our loan-to-values.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
A couple of quick ones. First, what was the accretable yields for the quarter and what's the outlook for accretable
yield in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So, Matt, we said the third quarter was $8.5 million on the loan side. That ticked up about $3 million this
quarter. And we anticipate, I think we said that $8 million to $10 million is a good run rate on a quarterly basis,
and that remains kind of our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then what is − just give us some outlook for the securities portfolio in 2023 and whether or not you see
much of any growth or should it match, kind of overall balance sheet composition stay the same?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So as a reminder, it represents a little less than 10% of our earning assets, so it's not a material driver of
income. Nevertheless, that portfolio is very high quality. And remember, the majority of that is held in − are held
for maturity, so 75-ish percent and so the 25% is only held in the AFS portfolio.
I don't really expect a lot of changes. I guess the biggest change you've seen probably, just an industry change
has been that any kind of payouts have ground to a halt. And so you have very little coming due that way. What
we will add is in the highest-quality ranges and probably in the lowest risk-weighted asset ranges. And we'll keep
pace obviously. As a reminder, we have a lot of public fund money in this bank as well, and government banking
as a niche for us is an important niche. So we do have to have collateral for that business, so we will continue to
maintain at a minimum what we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, Ira, just would love your thoughts in 2023 around M&A. Previously, the message was,
look, we got a ton of stuff to do organically. There's plenty of opportunity on that front. I felt like M&A would have
to be incredibly spectacular for you to do it, but my read was probably not. Just wanted some updated thoughts
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I would probably say you could copy and paste back into the comments for this quarter as well. I think we're very
fortunate that we are likely an acquirer of choice, a partner of choice for many people that are out there today,
which is wonderful, I think, based on the experience and successes that we've had.
Maximizing and focusing on tangible book value is something that I've always talked about from day one when I
became CEO, and that really continues. And today when you look at the economic environment, I think it's very
difficult to do an M&A transaction that isn't necessarily just a resource stream, but really drains the tangible book
value as well, and that's not something that I'm comfortable with doing.

Outside of that, I do believe that we have such tremendous opportunities on an organic basis that we should
continue to focus on those resources. We still need to continue to convert and get some of the synergies
associated with the Bank Leumi deal, and there's tremendous opportunities with that. So, like I said, probably
copy and paste, Matt.

Hey, Frank. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just on that – good, good. Thanks. Just on the niche businesses, I think, Tom, you talked about sort of the way
you approach that, you lump in the cannabis, the HOA, the national deposits. And you mentioned a growth rate in
the quarter. Just wondering, as we think about those businesses maybe ramping up, I'd assume that we could
see greater contribution on a quarterly basis going forward. And then just also curious, is that largely low to no
cost deposits within that umbrella?
<A – [06V6PF-E Tom Iadanza] : Yeah. When you look at the individual component, certainly, we've been ramping
up the HOA and that's largely noninterest-bearing deposits. We talked about the national deposits business.
That's primarily an interest-bearing program and process there. The tech will have a large portion of noninterest-
bearing but we'll have interest-bearing mixed in there also. And the plan on tech is really to broaden the users and
have reliance in addition to domestic VCs to go along with the Israeli VCs that we're doing business with today.
There are other – cannabis, again, will be multistate operators, primarily a noninterest-bearing program. So, yeah,
the plan is to ramp up our specialty, our niche businesses, focusing on the deposit side of it.

Frank Schiraldi Q

– put any parameters around how volatile it has been? I think you said 5% of deposits right now and where that's
gotten to over the last couple of quarters? And do you see it just continuing to be volatile here in the short term?

Michael D. Hagedorn A

That's a great question. Other than the IPO event, the very discrete events that we talked about, it's not actually
been that volatile for us. We know from talking and listening to industry folks that in other portfolios, it can be
incredibly volatile but ours has not been.
Now, granted, we've only had three-fourths of a year of experience with it. So you got to take that for what it's
worth.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And can you lump in there – is that like a Bank Leumi umbrella? I mean, do you lump the private banking
that you got from that acquisition in with those technology deposits, or how has that growth rate been for you
guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
No, the private banking, both international and domestic, is not included in technology.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And have you seen a contraction in that business, or do you have any – the size, the relative size of that
business at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So I think we've said this before, the international business, from a deposit perspective, is larger than the
domestic business. And the domestic business is going to grow – this is one of the synergies that we identified as
part of the Leumi acquisition – will grow because of the private banking business that we have on our side, the
legacy side of the business, I should say.
The international private banking business has had some reduction in deposits. The good news is, remember,
that's both a deposit and an AUM business. And for the most part, their value add has been structured notes and,
obviously, the market has not been conducive to that. So we've been able to retain those clients by moving the
vast majority of them into Treasury securities. And then in a different interest rate environment, I would expect
some of those, as they mature, to come back on balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
And just one thing to add, in the last six months, we've had over $250 million of referrals from the legacy Valley
customers into the domestic private bank for assets to manage. And it's a constant flow of consumer loan
business that comes out of that private bank portfolio into Valley.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2023
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just lastly, sorry if I missed it, but could you give any more color on the participation? I thought I
heard you mention that you wanted to leave, and I think you mentioned Leumi in there as well. But just want to
make sure I heard it right with the partial charge-off [indiscernible] (00:51:21)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Yeah. Certainly. So this is a customer that, again, banking with us in 2006, so almost 17 years. We began
with a $7.5 million share and a total $25 million credit facility or 30%. Company performed well over the years.
The credit facility grew to $160 million since that 2006 inception. We always manage our exposures, and we
increased our exposure from 7.5% to 19% but reduced our overall from 30% to 12%.
The company sells cardboard boxes for shipping produce. Their customer's customer had a concentration to
Russian entities. The embargo has put a very, very big strain on their customers' ability to pay them. We saw that
early on, took early action. We put this on nonaccrual early in 2022, and we reserved 100% of the loan during
2022. This represents about a 50% charge-off of our outstanding loans. Isolated, we do constant reviews of all of
our receivable-backed loans to see if there's any stretching of payments on those. And as Ira mentioned earlier,
our credit metrics remain strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And it's probably important to note that Leumi had a piece of this as well. So the combined numbers will be
different because they had a piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So I'm sorry, Leumi, the American bank, had a piece, and so you're saying it's larger, your total...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Yeah, I was referring to the management of the Valley total over those 16, 17 years. When we acquired
Leumi they were also a participant in the bank group. The charge-off and the reserve represents both bank
shares.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. Okay. Thank you.
