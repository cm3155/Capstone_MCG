Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our first quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Again, these results are supported by our
colleagues who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and
strengthen the communities we serve.
Now on to slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are executing our
organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength. As planned and managed over the years, our
liquidity and capital metrics are top tier.
Second, we delivered loan growth in the quarter and expect the pace to accelerate over the remainder of the
year. Our teams are acquiring new customers and relationships in both commercial and consumer categories. We
are maintaining our momentum in deposit gathering with a well-managed beta.
Third, we expect to drive sequential increases in net interest income and fee revenues from the level reported in
the first quarter, supported by accelerating loan growth coupled with effective balance sheet management.
Fourth, we continued to rigorously manage credit consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
Finally, we are positioned to power earnings expansion over the course of the year and into 2025. Our
investments are delivering results, and the underlying core is performing well.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
I will move us on to slide 5 to recap our performance. We delivered loan growth with balances growing by $1.6
billion from a year ago and have grown by a 4% CAGR over the past two years. This pace reflects our intentional
optimization efforts last year, and we believe we are positioned to accelerate growth over the course of 2024 and
carrying into 2025. Deposit balances also increased, growing $7.9 billion or 5.5% over the past year. Capital
remained strong with reported common equity Tier 1 of 10.2% and adjusted common equity Tier 1 of 8.5%
inclusive of AOCI.
Liquidity remains top tier with coverage of uninsured deposits of 205%, a peer-leading level. Credit quality was
stable as net charge-offs improved by 1 basis point from the fourth quarter to 30 basis points. We are sustaining
momentum in growth of our primary bank relationships with consumer and business increasing by 2% and 4%,
respectively, year-over-year.
We continue to seize opportunities to add talented bankers. Over the past two quarters, we've added teams in the
Carolinas and Texas. We've also launched new commercial specialty verticals, including fund finance, healthcare
ABL, and Native American financial services.
The momentum we have across our markets, coupled with our strong culture, continues to attract great banking
talent to Huntington. We expect to add additional colleagues and capabilities as we move through the year. We
have clear objectives for 2024 focused on executing our organic growth strategies. This should result in
accelerated loan growth, sustained deposit growth, and expanded fee revenue streams. Coupled with our
expense outlook, we expect to see PPNR expanding over the course of the year and into 2025.
The macro environment is conducive to growth with customer demand holding up well in a resilient and stable
economy. The addition of new markets and bankers is supporting expanding loan pipelines with late-stage
commercial pipelines ending the quarter at the highest level in over a year.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.26 and adjusted EPS of $0.28. The quarter included $39 million of
notable items primarily related to the updated FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund special assessment of $32 million,
which was driven by higher losses from last year's bank failures.
Additionally, we incurred $7 million of costs related to incremental business process offshoring efficiency plans
that were finalized during the quarter. These items collectively impacted EPS by $0.02 per common share.
Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 14.2% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items,
ROTCE was 15.3%. Average deposits continued to grow during the quarter, increasing by $1.1 billion or 0.7%.
Cumulative deposit beta totaled 43% through quarter-end. Average loan balances increased by $701 million or
0.6% for the quarter. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 30 basis points. Allowance for credit
losses was stable and ended the quarter at 1.97%.
Turning to slide 7. As I noted, average loan balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were higher by 1.3%
year-over-year. For the quarter, loans increased at a 2.3% annualized pace. We expect the pace of future loan
growth to accelerate over the course of 2024.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Loan growth was commercial-led for the quarter with total commercial loans increasing by $691 million.
Commercial balance growth included distribution finance, which increased by $352 million, benefiting from normal
seasonality. Auto floorplan increased by $313 million. CRE balances declined by $31 million. All other commercial
portfolios were relatively unchanged on a net basis.
Within other commercial, we saw notable strength in regional and business banking balances as a result of
sustained production levels and the continued retention of all SBA loan production on balance sheet.
In total consumer loans, average balances were flat overall for the quarter. Within consumer, residential mortgage
increased by $137 million, benefiting from production as well as slower prepay speeds. Average auto balances
declined by $59 million, however, increased by $180 million on an end-of-period basis. RV/Marine average
balances declined by $42 million and home equity was lower by $35 million.
Turning to slide 8. As noted, we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth. Average deposits increased by
$1.1 billion in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, deposits have increased by $4.6 billion or 3.1%. Total
cumulative deposit beta continued to decelerate quarter-over-quarter and ended at 43%, consistent with our
expectations for this point in the rate cycle. Our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged, trending a
few percentage points higher so long as there is a pause from the Fed and then beginning to revert and fall when
we see rate cuts.
Market expectations for rate cuts have clearly been pushed out compared to our January earnings call. We
continue to believe that there will be rate cuts over time and the impact of beta will be a function of the duration in
this pause from the Fed.
Turning to slide 9. Non-interest-bearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast. Average non-interest-bearing
balances decreased by $1.3 billion or 4% from the prior quarter. We continue to expect this mix shift to moderate
and stabilize during 2024.
On to slide 10. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $27 million or 2% to $1,300 million. Net interest
margin declined sequentially to 3.01%. Cumulatively, over the cycle, we have benefited from our asset sensitivity
and earning asset growth, with net interest revenues growing at a 6% CAGR over the past two years. Reconciling
the change in NIM from Q4, we saw a decrease of 6 basis points. This was primarily due to lower spread net of
free funds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 1 basis point benefit from lower average Fed cash
and 2 basis points positive impact from other items, including lower hedge drag impact.
We continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing. We have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio
yields thus far in the rate cycle, and many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing
opportunity through 2024 and into 2025.
As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and
interest rate scenarios for both short-term rates as well as the slope and level of the curve. The basis of our
planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that are bounded on the low end by a
scenario that includes three Fed fund cuts in 2024, which tracks closely to the current Fed dot plot. This scenario
is also aligned to the forward curve from the end of March for longer-durated time points.
It's important to note that the level of the curve in the two- to five-year term points is an important driver of our
asset repricing and spreads. The higher scenario assume rates stay higher for longer with no Fed fund rate
reductions this year. This scenario also assumes the longer-durated time points remain at or above the levels at
5

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
quarter-end. In both of these scenarios, as we project further out into 2025, we continue to believe it is most likely
that there will eventually be rate cuts at some point as we get into next year.
Comparing our latest outlook for those scenarios to the range of outlook we shared in our January guidance,
there have certainly been changes given the volatility of rates over the past quarter. Both scenarios now expect
Fed funds to stay elevated for longer, which will drive some incremental deposit beta. While the belly of the curve
has improved, which will also support asset yields and repricing benefit, it's difficult to predict exactly how the rate
environment will play out over the course of the year.
As we look at the impact of this rate outlook on our business, the fundamental elements of our prior guidance
remain unchanged. There's much of the year left to play out; and as a result, we're maintaining our range for full-
year spread revenue growth. At the margin, we're seeing somewhat higher funding costs as the expected timing
of rate cuts has been pushed out. If this plays out for the full year, our view is that the overall NIM outcome could
be a few basis points lower than our previous guidance in both scenarios.
Importantly, we're also seeing strong continued deposit growth that is more likely to be at the top end of our
deposit growth guidance range, which provides good core funding for accelerating loan growth.
We continue to see Q1 as the trough for net interest income on a dollar basis. We expect sequential growth in
spread revenues from this level during the remaining quarters of the year. We also continue to project that a
higher rate scenario will produce a higher overall NIM. In this scenario, we would see a more extended trend of
higher deposit beta and hence, overall funding costs would be higher. We would also see an incrementally higher
fixed asset repricing benefit.
Importantly, our core focus is on driving revenue growth. And as I noted, we continue to forecast that the
combination of this margin outlook, coupled with accelerating loan growth will drive solid revenue expansion from
here. This will support accelerating earnings growth rates as we move throughout this year and continue on into
2025.
Turning to slide 11, our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from
sustained deposit growth as well as our senior note offering and ABS transactions in the first quarter. We expect
cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at approximately 27% to 28% as the
balance sheet grows over time. We are reinvesting securities cash flows in short-duration HQLA, consistent with
our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time. We have reduced the
overall hedged duration of the portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.5 years over the past 7 quarters.
Turning to slide 12, you can see an updated outlook for AOCI. Based on the rate environment at quarter end,
AOCI moved incrementally higher. AOCI at quarter-end was 21% lower than the levels we saw in the third
quarter. Our outlook continues to forecast a substantial portion of AOCI recapture over the next couple of years.
Turning to slide 13, we have updated the presentation of our balance sheet hedging program in order to more
directly illustrate the intent of the hedging program. This view shows the effective swap profile in the future,
including the effect of forward starting swaps. So you can see more directly the hedging exposures as they will
play out over the next two years. Slide 43 in the appendix provides the total notional swap exposure similar to our
prior reporting.
As of March 31, we have $16.8 billion of effective received fixed swaps and $10.7 billion of effective pay-fixed
swaps. Our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives, to protect margin and revenue and down
6

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
rate environment and to protect capital in potential uprate scenarios. The pay-fixed swaps, which have been
effective in protecting capital during this rate cycle, have a weighted average life of just over three years and will
begin to mature beginning in the second quarter of 2025. As these instruments mature, our asset sensitivity will
reduce.
Over time, we intend to gradually add to our down rate protection program at a measured pace. As the rate
outlook moved over the course of the first quarter and the yield curve became less negatively inverted, we
incrementally added to our down rate protection hedges. We added $3.5 billion of notional forward starting
received fixed swaps in the first quarter. Additionally, through the first two weeks of April, we added another $2
billion of forward starting received fixed swaps. The forward starting structure minimizes near-term negative carry
while protecting moderate term net interest margin in 2025 and 2026. These instruments will also reduce the
overall asset sensitivity of the business.
We will remain dynamic to manage the hedging and interest rate positioning of the balance sheet, and we may
make further changes over time. Our current approach is designed to gradually reduce asset sensitivity
throughout the next year and a half, while allowing us to maximize the benefit from the current rate environment.
Moving on to slide 14. Our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas: Capital Markets, Payments,
and Wealth Management. In Capital Markets, total revenues declined from the prior quarter, driven by lower
advisory revenues. Commercial banking-related capital markets revenues increased sequentially since troughing
in the third quarter. As commercial loan production continues to accelerate, this will support growth in areas such
as interest rate derivatives, FX, and syndications. Debt capital markets is also expected to notably benefit over
the course of the year. Within advisory, pipelines and backlog continued to remain robust, and we expect advisory
to contribute to growth in capital markets revenues over the remainder of the year.
Payments & Cash Management revenue was seasonally lower in the first quarter and increased 7% year-over-
year. Debit card revenue continues to outperform industry benchmarks. Treasury management fees have
increased 10% year-over-year as we have deepened customer penetration. We have substantive opportunities
across the board in Payments to grow revenues over the coming years.
Our Wealth & Asset Management strategy is delivering results, with revenues up 10% from the prior year. We are
seeing great execution and the benefits of our investments in this area. Advisory relationships have increased 8%
year-over-year, and assets under management have increased 12% year-over-year.
Turning to slide 15. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income increased by $62 million to $467 million for the
first quarter. Excluding the impacts of the mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions in the prior quarter and the
CRT, fees declined seasonally by $12 million quarter-over-quarter. Our first quarter fee revenue is generally the
low point for the year, and we expect non-interest income to grow sequentially from this quarter's level.
Moving on to slide 16 on expenses. GAAP non-interest expense decreased by $211 million and underlying core
expenses decreased by $24 million. During the quarter, we incurred $32 million of incremental expense related to
the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Special Assessment, as well as $7 million related to our ongoing business
process offshoring program to drive efficiencies. Excluding these items, core expenses were marginally lower in
the first quarter than we expected, largely due to timing of certain spend on tech and data initiatives as well as
lower incentive compensation.
We continue to forecast 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. From a timing standpoint, we expect core
expenses to be higher in the second quarter at approximately $1,130 million. This level should be relatively stable
7

for the third and fourth quarter. There may be some variability given revenue-driven compensation as well as the
pace of expected new hiring activities. This level of expense supports our investments into organic growth
strategies as well as data and technology initiatives.
Slide 17 recaps our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.2%. Our adjusted CET1 ratio,
inclusive of AOCI, was 8.5% and has grown 60 basis points from a year ago. Our capital management strategy
remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high-return loan growth.
We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%.
On slide 18, credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs were
30 basis points in Q1, 1 basis point lower than the prior quarter. They remain in the lower half of our through-the-
cycle range of 25 to 45 basis points. Allowance for credit losses was stable at 1.97%. Non-performing assets
increased approximately 4% from the previous quarter to 60 basis points while remaining below the prior 2021
level. The criticized asset ratio also increased approximately 3% quarter-over-quarter with sequential increases
slowing quarter-over-quarter. The overall health of the portfolio is strong and tracking to our expectations.
Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. Overall, our guidance ranges are unchanged. On loans, we expect to drive
accelerated growth from the first quarter totaling between 3% and 5% on a full-year basis. This will be driven by
solid performance in our core as well as meaningful contribution from the new teams and market expansions. On
deposits, we're keeping the overall range the same up between 2% and 4%. We do see it more likely to end up at
the higher portion of that range based on our momentum and the traction we're seeing with deposit gathering.
Net interest income is expected to be within a range of down 2% and up 2% on a full-year basis. As I noted, we
see NIM likely a few basis points lower than our earlier guidance. We project spread revenue to expand on a
dollar basis from the Q1 level into the second quarter and throughout 2024.
Fee growth strategies remain on track, and we continue to see core non-interest income growth of 5% to 7% for
the full year. Expense outlook is unchanged, expecting 4.5% core expense growth for the full year. Credit quality,
as I mentioned, is tracking closely to our expectations, and we continue to expect full-year net charge-offs
between 25 and 35 basis points.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to Q&A. Tim, over to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Our first question is coming from Manan
Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Good morning, Manan. Welcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. So your comments on the NII guide were very thorough, so really appreciate that. I think – so the lower end
of your guide is now for three cuts, and I think your guide is a little bit more conservative on deposit betas than
some of the other comments we've heard. So I was wondering if you can expand on that a little bit. Is that based
on conversations you're having with customers or – what's driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure, Manan. Thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll take that. Broadly speaking, we're seeing the NIM
outcome very similar to the view we had before. Just as I mentioned, it's sort of moderate tuning lower. And
clearly, the biggest change in the environment over the last three months since we gave guidance in January was
the expectation for a much longer pause in the spread posture before any rate reduction. And so at the margin,
really, we're seeing slightly higher deposit funding costs and overall interest-bearing liability costs.
The other thing that's important, which I've noted in the prepared remarks as well, is the deposit volumes are
coming in very strong and slightly at the higher end of our prior expectation as well and so that's contributing
somewhat, although really good core funding clearly for really accelerating loan growth over time. So, that's really
the driver.
As we entered the quarter – I'll just provide one last piece of color on that. As we entered the quarter, the market
forward was for the first rate reduction to be in March, right? We always knew that that was – we took the view
that that was likely not to be the case. But clearly, that was the forecast of the market broadly, and we're
beginning to execute the early stages of the down beta actions we've discussed, shortening CD term duration,
changing other elements of our pricing [indiscernible] (00:24:54) throughout the quarter, clearly, that reset. And
so, we've had to continue to be dynamic as we would always be in managing deposit pricing. And likely now,
those more substantive downgrade actions would push further out. So that's really the biggest driver of sort of the
timing of when we'll begin to see more significant downgrade actions.
Over time, we would expect it to be just as effective going forward as we've been in the past on that. It is really
just when will that occur and add a few bps of additional funding costs here in 2024.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, is any of that because you're also planning ahead of this accelerating loan growth that you're expecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
That was a good question, Manan. Look, the posture [indiscernible] (00:25:42) here clearly of when will rate cuts
reduce and also, not only when will the first one happen but what will be the expected trajectory by the market
and by customers clearly thereafter. For us, we're very dynamic and granular on how we manage this to really
optimize the next step unit of funding here. So continually thinking about when is that rate cut going to happen
and, obviously, attempting to play in front of it. With that being said, we're talking about marginal tuning here and
that we wouldn't over plan it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. If I could add, this is Steve. Our commercial pipeline is very robust, and each month of the quarter has
improved. So we go into the second quarter with a very good, healthy outlook. And as we think about guidance for
the year, we think on the loan side, we're going to be closer to the top end, which is in part of the consideration for
adding the deposits at the rate that we're doing here at this earlier stage of the year, Manan, thanks for the
question.

So thanks for the color on the NII guide. Just to confirm again, so it does – you did indicate that you are factoring
in a higher-for-longer environment when all is said and done in your outlook. But again, you maintain the NII guide
of down 2% to up 2%. Is the primary reason for the maintaining that versus any upside bias would be is it mainly
the deposit costs that you just discussed coming in higher or is there any other factor?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
That is the primary driver. So yes is the answer to that. Seeing a little lower, a few basis points lower NIM, but
incrementally somewhat stronger loan growth. Those things are largely offsetting [indiscernible] (00:27:54) the
ultimate results in that guidance range. And importantly, the key thing for us is that trajectory growing net interest
income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter and into the second quarter and continuing on into the third and
fourth quarter, so the outcome of that is going to be solidly expanding revenue growth and solidly expanding profit
growth as well. So yes to the fundamentals of your question and overall generally unchanged.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks for that, Zach. And then separately, back to the loan growth topic. Steve, you just discussed
that you've got confidence in the outlook, particularly given your pipelines. Maybe can you talk about where
demand stands now, where utilization is now, and what type of inflection do you see here? Because it seems like
you've got confidence in the back half strengthening and I mean, what anecdotal data do you have that kind of
support that acceleration? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, John. We see the commercial pipeline for the second quarter, particularly the high probability to close
level, to be very, very, very strong relative to the last five quarters. So as I've said, each month has improved in
the first quarter. Second quarter strength is obvious now at this stage. We're also seeing good business banking
loan growth, and we have the benefit of these new initiatives, none of which have books that they're carrying. So
the three new initiatives, specialty banking last year and then Carolina's off to a really good start. Texas, I was
there a couple of weeks ago. We've got a great team there as well. All of those investments will bolster our
activities throughout the year.
And then, as you know, we've got one of the largest [indiscernible] (00:29:57) finance companies in the country
that tends to be somewhat seasonal fourth quarter. So those would be the combination of factors that give us a lot
of confidence that we'll be at or near that upper end of our guidance for the full year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I kind of wanted – I wanted to revisit the margin as well. So
on the deposit pricing, is it possible to make sort of a broad comment about is this sort of something that you're
seeing and reflecting on kind of market pricing pressures or would you say you're more on sort of the leading?
Because it sounds like we're trying to support the loan growth which is obviously a very positive differentiating
factor. But are you all kind of leading with pricing on the deposit side to fund that growth – or what does the
competitive dynamic look like as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Scott. This is Zach. I'll take it. I would characterize the competitive intensity of the market
as generally consistent today with how it was at this time last quarter. So I don't think there's any substantive
change. It remains a competitive market, and clients are clearly aware of rate and the competitive rate
environment on the consumer and the small business commercial side, so it's a transparent market.

I think what has happened, part of what we're seeing is – and I'm giving you guidance on this, not just what's
happening right now in the market but the outlook for the whole year. And so, that's really, I think the way you
should interpret these comments is whereas before there was a fairly strong conviction of the marketplace
thinking about prior guidance ranges had the first cut beginning somewhere between March and August. Clearly,
that timeframe for cuts has been pushed out. And so, the period of time before we can begin to manage
substantive downgrade actions, that's just been extended, and that's really the main driver here.
I think the – our pricing strategy is pretty much the same which is continue to price in competitive ways but not
lead the market, to be clear, and really drive the fundamentals of deposit growth from customer acquisition. We
talked about 2% primary bank relationship growth in consumer, 4% in business banking, growing on the
commercial side as well. So that's the underpinning of – the pricing strategy is really just designed to ensure that
there's fair and appropriate pricing as we got on those deposits.

R. Scott Siefers Q

Not to beat a dead horse on the net interest income guidance but last quarter, with three cuts that got us to the
high end of the range and now three cuts to get us to the low end of the range, and I'm somewhat confused –
Zach, I always think your hedge fund magic keeps as relatively stable over short periods of time. I'm a little
confused why three cuts now put us down 2% versus up 2% last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good question. I appreciate it. And I think what I'll just bring you back to is the sort of two key
things here. Overall, the NIM outlook for us in both scenarios is a few basis points lower, mainly as a function of
12

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
the timing of when rate reductions will begin and when we'll see substantive down beta actions to somewhat
higher funding cost environment than we expected, and that's really the main driver.
Second thing I would say is the four key factors for us that are driving the NIM this year remain the same. The
biggest positive factor is fixed asset repricing. We tried to share in the prepared remarks that we expect to see
about $4 billion quarterly repricing of fixed assets, which should drive substantive benefit on the order of between
10 and even 12 or 13 basis points, depending on how the belly of the curve maintains here over the course of this
year.
The second positive factor is a gradual reduction to the amount of hedge drag we've got in the NIM. In Q1, we
had 16 basis points of hedge drag, and I expect to see something between 5 to up to 8 to maybe even 10 basis
points, again, depending on how the curve moves here over the course of the rest of this year until Q4. Those are
the two biggest positive factors.
The other two factors are what's going on with the variable yields and what's going on with funding costs. Those
are largely offsetting each other in both of the – for those moving on the direct opposite directions to be clear, in
either a higher rate cut or a lower rate cut scenario. And those are modestly negative for the full year that would
offset those positives and keep the overall NIM in the generally flat to rising position from here. So none of that
has really changed.
The last thing I would say, a third point, is that all of the modeling we're doing continues to indicate that a higher
rate scenario overall, all things equal, drives a higher NIM for us. Clearly, how this plays out over such a short
period of time, three quarters, will be really depending on the shape and trajectory and timing and everything, but
that's the best we can do. And I think the guidance we're trying to give here with this range of scenarios is
designed to allow us to give you stability in terms of the revenue guidance which, ultimately, is the most important
bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Zach, if we put all this together, you're seeing NII bottomed in the first quarter, but I didn't hear you say NIM
bottomed in the first quarter. Does that imply NIM has not bottomed in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I expect to see NIM bouncing around these levels or rising over the course of the rest of the year kind of
depending on how the scenario plays out. And for that kind of flat-to-rising NIM, coupled with accelerated loan
growth to drive accelerating net interest income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter into the second quarter of
growth and then continuing to grow into the third and the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. But just one separate question, on the non-interest-bearing deposits, balance is down pretty sharp
average at period-end. We're seeing some of your peers showing in February and March good stability in those
balances. Did you guys see that as well, or did you see balances declining through the quarter? Thanks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Balances were modestly declining through the quarter. As we look at that, we would see a few things. One is the
trajectory of dollars of non-interest bearing actually decelerating in terms of the mix shifts. Secondly, for the most
part, all of the mix shift that we think will happen in the same consumer has happened and where there's
continued drift in Q1 is really on the business in commercial side.
Another point would be we expect the non-interest-bearing mix shift, mix of the percentage, to continue to
stabilize in the high-teens over the course of this year with 19.4% as of Q1.
And the last thing I would say is, as you think about that percentage, it's very notable to measure that percentage
if overall deposits are shrinking versus if they're growing. For us, overall deposits are growing strongly as we've
said. So the mix is one thing, but the dollars are really the most important thing. And that, we see, is stabilizing
here over the course of the next couple of quarters.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just wanted to go back to something, Steve, you mentioned. I think, in your prepared remarks, you said
that the outlook and the economy is more conducive for growth. Your message is probably the most upbeat I've
heard over the last week. If you don't mind spending some time in terms of breaking down what you're seeing
from customers in terms of strength in loan demand looking into 2Q and beyond and how much of this change is
just because of the proactive action Huntington has taken to hire bankers in Carolinas, Texas. Would love some
color around both those aspects. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Ebrahim. The economy, we obviously look at the aggregate metrics that are released, and there's an
underlying strength. We're seeing that particularly because we've been proactive with our lending activities
through last year. The core is performing well. We're getting growth in our auto book, our distribution finance and,
particularly, our business bank. So very, very localized levels principally here in the Midwest.
We're also getting growth in a number of our other areas. And these new verticals that have been added. They've
all closed [ph] modeled (00:39:36). They've all generated lending activity and other activity. And the Carolina

expansion and Texas expansion are delivering results and look very promising to us. So we've positioned the
bank, both with the core activities and the incremental investments, I think to outperform peers in loan growth and
perhaps in a number of other respects as well certainly through this year and potentially beyond.
The pipeline activity I referenced earlier is very promising. And again, the strength of the first quarter, with every
month improving, gives us a lot of confidence. Our investment banking activity [indiscernible] (00:40:27) related.
They're pipeline is bigger than they've ever had as an example. So we've got a lot of opportunity in front of us and
now we have to deliver.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That is helpful. And, Zach, a couple of follow-ups for you. One, apologies on NII. I feel like I'm more confused after
some of this back and forth. Should we expect if we don't get any rate cuts or maybe – or just one cut, NII trends
towards up 2%? Is that the right takeaway?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It will really be [indiscernible] (00:41:01) take there. So I think the outcome will be somewhere between that range
of [indiscernible] (00:41:07). When we give these ranges, we try to generally box our plan and land in the middle
of it. But, of course, there's a bit of variance and just normal variability that's hard to forecast with such precision.
So that's the expectation.
I think we'll see, as I noted and just to clarify, a flat to rising NIM, a slightly higher NIM in the higher rate scenario
albeit with different drivers, and really coupling that with accelerating loan growth will drive dollars out of the level
we've seen in Q1 up into Q2 and beyond and to land for a full year somewhere in the middle of that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
All right. So multiple scenarios, middle of the range, and any scenario where this could exceed up 2%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly, it's possible. [indiscernible] (00:42:02) how the rate environment plays out here. I think really –
just one, we're probably parsing the precision more than is reasonable. It's still a pretty moving target in terms of
where the yield curve is now, but I think we'll land somewhere in that range with our best estimate.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Hi. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for that incremental slide on the swaps detail. I'm wondering if you can just
kind of help us understand as we get through the end of this year, both in terms of what that swaps impact looks
like and as important, that fixed rate repricing, how should we think about those kind of combined benefits as we
get out of 2024 and think about 2025? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a terrific question. Just maybe I'll say a few things on that. One is the fixed asset repricing benefit that
we saw – I mentioned earlier saw between 10, 11, 12, 13 basis points of upside this year from that $4 billion
turning quarterly. Our modeling indicates that that will continue on into 2025 with kind of a similar pace. It's really
a very long-term phenomenon, and that gives us a significant support to be able to get into 2025.
On the hedge drag factor within NIM, that 16 bps in Q1, reducing down by something like 5 to 8 basis points, I
mean, as much as 10 basis points depending on the rate scenario, lower by the end of Q4, that should also
continue on into the early part of 2025 as well, probably get to about neutral position if there are some rate
reductions. And so, if you just look at the rate curves – all the rate curve. There is an expectation in the forward
curve at this point that there will be, in fact, reductions either in the back half of this year or certainly into the early
part of next year.
And so, if that comes to pass then we'll see that 16 basis points sort of fully resolve by the middle of 2025. If there
aren't rate reductions then you'd see less of that hedge drag coming back. But obviously, that will be a kind of
very different environment overall regardless.
The other thing I will just say – and you didn't ask me, but I'll share it – is if you look at sort of the sum total of all
of our hedging activities which, as you know, are always designed to protect capital against down rate scenarios,
protect NIM in down rate scenarios, that chart that I illustrated in the prepared remarks has the kind of a gradual
shifting of that exposure as you get into and throughout 2025. The net result of that should be that, by the end of
2025, asset sensitivity should be about a third less.
And so, that's sort of the intent of that program more broadly from a interest rate risk and asset sensitivity
management perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Cool. And then my follow-up, I'll separate them. On just the fixed rate repricing on the asset side, so we
know about the meaningful help that you get this year, but then how did that layer in in terms of incremental fixed
rate benefit that happens into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So [indiscernible] (00:45:34) I think it's about the same benefit as we go out into 2025, and that's a fairly
similar turn of quarterly volumes and continue to see the belly of the curve that's largely always [indiscernible]
(00:45:52) significantly higher than the historical rates of those assets. Over time, of course, you'll begin to see
that benefit reduce on a sequential basis. And at some point, it starts to asymptote, but likely not until the latter
part of 2025 at the earliest at this point based on how the curve is shaping up.

Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Can you touch a little bit on the fee income outlook and what you expect there? It seems like you're implying
a bit of a step-up on that based on what you saw in the quarter but talk a little bit about what you're seeing there
and then confidence in hitting that midpoint of the guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Q1 core fees grew about 3% year-over-year, and our guidance of the full year is between 5% and 7% on a
full year, so that clearly implies we're going to see an acceleration of fee income and acceleration on a year-over-
year basis as we look out this year and high confidence to achieve that.
The core drivers remain the same as what we've discussed on many prior occasions. Capital Markets, Payments
and Wealth Management, if you look at sort of the trends we're seeing right now and what their performance was
in the first quarter, Payments revenue was up 7% in the first quarter; Wealth revenue was up 10%; and Capital
Markets, we saw commercial banking-related revenues kind of around two-thirds of the Capital Markets activities
that are really highly correlated to the pace and volume of commercial banking. That grew sequentially into the
first quarter and was the second sequential quarter of growth there. And I think one of the things that will power
continued growth in Capital Markets from here is the fact that commercial loan production is likewise accelerating,
as Steve noted earlier.
Advisory revenues were really beginning to recover well in the back half of 2023 but typically seasonally lower in
Q1 for us in our focus in middle market advisory, so we did see those advisory revenues lower to the first quarter.
But likewise, our expectation for that is for continued expansion into the remaining part of this year. Pipelines look
very good, very high quality, great firms that have contracted with us to look for M&A support. And so, those are
really the drivers from here.

Payments continuing to perform well, continuing to execute the strategy and then Capital Markets driving
acceleration as well. And overall, we continue to feel really, really good about landing somewhere in that full year
sort of range.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Helpful. I won't go back to net interest income, but I do want to ask about credit. Your numbers
obviously look good, but anything you want to flag internally that you're seeing and I'm curious also what you're
seeing externally from a credit point of view. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan A. Lawlor A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey. This is Brendan. I'll take that one. I think, as you sort of noted in your question that the story of the quarter is
stability. We, across all of the credit metrics, are pretty much in line with where we reported into the fourth quarter
or seasonally adjusted when you think about delinquencies. Looking back at first quarter of last year, we're right in
line, and we feel really good about the position that we're sitting in right now.
If there's the one place that everybody continues to focus on and talk about, and we're highly focused on it
ourselves, is office and the commercial real estate side. But as we've talked about in the past, we have one of the
smaller books relative to our office portfolio, and we have a decent reserve against it. So we – while we're
watching it and actively managing it, we feel very well protected against it at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Just to add to that – thanks, Brendan – we've reduced the office portfolio by about $500 million over the course of
the last four quarters. And our largest loan is [ph] $40 million (00:50:18). The average is $7 million-ish. So it's very
granular, and it gets a lot of attention. We expect it will continue to reduce throughout this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. If I can ask one more, I'm going to violate the one and one follow-up, but just bigger picture, there's
been this myopic focus on the margin and net interest income. Do you guys – do you feel incrementally better or
worse about that plus or minus 2% guide? Because on one hand, we're thinking about a lower margin in the very
near term, and I get that. But it seems like it's higher funding cost to fund loan growth, which seems to be at the
higher end of it. So I guess the question is, with some of these new developments, do you feel better or worse
about that higher or lower end of the net interest income guide? I think that would help people. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Jon, I'll take that one. Look, [ph] two things I would make (00:51:16). First is, we feel really
good about the overall performance of the business. For us, it's about executing long-term growth, long-term
value creation, and Q1 set that up really well. We've seen confidence in loan growth accelerating, great core
funding and therefore, the confidence in being within that range is very strong.
At the margin, my revenue outlook is a touch lower than was the case before and – but I think we're in a range of
tuning at this point, Jon. And hence, we should not overly parse this somewhere in that range as we try to land in
the middle of the ranges that we've given.

Peter J. Winter Q

...follow up. Hi. I want to follow up on Jon's question just on credit. If I look at the ACL ratio, it's at the top end of
the peers, and credit is really holding in, and you feel good about the economy. How are you thinking about
reserving going forward? Is the plan to keep the ACL ratio fairly steady and just kind of support loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan A. Lawlor A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Peter, it's Brendan. I'll take a swing at that. You're noting the stability quarter-over-quarter, and that's
accurate, I think. As we look forward, it's really a fact-specific as to how the ACL coverage will move quarter-over-
quarter as we take into account the modeling of our economic scenarios, the view of credit at that time, as well as
the loan growth that you referenced in your question.
We put all of that into the mix to sort of drive out of our modeling what we believe the right level of coverage is.
And so, it's harder for us to – for anybody, frankly, to – in this environment to really give any strong guidance as to
which way the ACL will move as it's really quarterly – it's a quarterly-specific metric these days the way it's run. So
it's hard for me to come out and say, we think it'll do this and we think it'll do that.

Peter, this is Steve. I'll just add to that. We try to be conservative with reserves over the years. We believe we're
in that posture today, and we expect to grow loans above peer this year and potentially beyond with the
investments in these new businesses and regions we've made. And there's still a lot of uncertainty about where
rates are going to go, when they're going to move, the geopolitical tension, the uncertainties that can spawn from
elections, both ours and other countries. So we just try to be conservative at this stage. Should we continue to
perform at the level we are, there will be reserve recapture at some point.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Just one quick follow-up. Just that comment that you're feeling better about loan growth,
how much of the loan growth acceleration is new markets versus just core strength? And is part of that positive
outlook given the early success that you're seeing on the new initiatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Zach. I'll take that one. If you look at the full-year loan growth outlook that we've got, it's between 3% and
5%, about 60% of that growth, we think, will come from the core and about 40% from these new organic
expansion areas we discussed. Within – and the mix of the overall company's growth will be weighted toward
commercial but consumer also growing pretty well. So that's the kind of broad answer in terms of the magnitude
of them.
And really, the other point is, yes, the early traction is really very positive. We're seeing customers already being
acquired, loans being booked, and the pipelines across all of the five new areas of focus to the three commercial
verticals, Carolinas and Texas, the pipeline cumulatively is approaching $2 billion of loans and also very
significant deposit pipeline. Remember, these are – tend to be full relationship strategies that are gathering loans
but also deposits, also fee income businesses in Capital Markets and Payments and Treasury Management. So
[indiscernible] (00:55:57) good early traction here, obviously, starting from a low base, as Steve mentioned. So
we're going to see that build here over the course of time.
The last thing I'll say is out of those five, the most significant contributors in 2024, we expect to be the fund
finance vertical and the Carolinas. Over time, the others will also be very significant, particularly Texas. But just in
terms of the early momentum that we're seeing and based on when they've started and we're staffed, those two
will be the most significant for 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
And just one last final, does the core loan growth assume a pickup in line utilization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Not in substance. So if you think about kind of the three big areas that we have, outstanding lines in the broad
middle market, commercial lines, we saw that tick up just a tiny bit into the first quarter pretty flat, and it's not our
expectation that that will change substantively from here.
The second one being distribution and finance. And that one, we did see a benefit into the first quarter from, but
that was the typical seasonal pattern. We think that line generally now has been at a stable level broadly, and
we're just going through the typical seasonal pattern. It's highest in the first quarter, it's lowest in the third quarter
just based on the kind of the cycles of inventory and sales.
And then the last one is auto floorplan. We did see that also benefit us somewhat into the first quarter. But again,
we think we're now at a point coming out of COVID, particularly in the auto floorplan business where
manufacturing has reached a stable level relative to sales in order to see line utilization generally trending in a
pretty consistent area from here in the floor plan business. So not counting on it really for the continued growth
although certainly benefiting from some previous seasonality in the first quarter.

Yeah. Good question, Matt. Thanks. So the answer is no, broadly. No substantive updates in terms of where that
may be going. If – for us, we've got a really strong debit card franchise. It's one of the best in the country in terms
of relative penetration and utilization within our consumer and small business base. And so, that's a real benefit to
us.
If you were to just run the numbers on the proposal as it was proposed, I think it's around a $90 million annualized
impact for us. With that being said, if history is a guide, often those proposals are changed substantively between
the time they were initially put forth and when enacted either to not going to [indiscernible] (00:59:31) at all or to
be substantively altered. And so, we'll see.
For us, in our Payments strategy, there's so much growth opportunity and so many opportunities to engage our
customers that there will be, over time, ways to mitigate some of that and certainly offset it with other Payments-
related growth. As best we can tell at this point, to the extent there is a proposal, it would be at some point mid to
latter part of 2025, it will take effect. And so not in the guidance for 2024, as you just heard.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So in closing, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We're seeing momentum build across the bank, which
will drive improved performance over the course of the year and beyond. We clearly expect our investments in our
businesses to deliver growth this year and in the future. The balance sheet is well-positioned, ample capital and
robust liquidity to support our growth initiatives. Our focus remains centered on driving core revenue growth,
carefully managing expenses, and growing with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
