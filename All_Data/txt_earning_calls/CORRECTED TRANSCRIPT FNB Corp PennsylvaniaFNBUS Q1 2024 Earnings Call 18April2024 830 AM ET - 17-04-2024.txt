Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President and CEO.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer.
FNB produced a solid quarter, reporting operating earnings per share of $0.34 and operating net income available
to common shareholders totaling $123 million. Our balance sheet resilience, robust fee income generation, strong
credit results, and continued progress of our Clicks-to-Bricks strategy we're at the forefront this quarter.
Our team remains focused on balance sheet management to position FNB for optimal flexibility during the volatile
interest rate period. This is evidenced by our tangible common equity ratio ending the first quarter at an all-time
high of 8%. In addition, our company reported solid loan growth of 6% and deposit growth of 2% on a year-over-
year basis. Deposit mix remained similar to the prior quarter with a favorable total deposit cost of less than 2%,
which is expected to remain superior to peers. Tangible book value per share also reached a record high at
$9.64, an 11% increase year-over-year as tangible book value growth remains a key value driver of our strategy.
FNB maintains strong levels of liquidity and uninsured and non-collateralized deposit coverage ratio of 162%. Our
noninterest income continues to grow, reaching $87.9 million, a near record level. This achievement is the result
of our geographic expansion and a decade of strategic investments in our mortgage, wealth management,
international banking, treasury management, and capital markets capabilities, including the launch of Loan
Syndications and the FNB debt capital markets platform.
Our diversified business model has enabled noninterest income to grow 75% from $200 million in 2016 to over
$350 million on an annualized basis. We recognize the benefit of having diverse revenue stream, which
complement one another during various points of the economic cycle. Looking ahead, we will continue to diversify
our noninterest income, products, and services with plans to further enhance our treasury management, merchant
services, and payment capabilities.
This past decade also included the launch of our Clicks-to-Bricks strategy. That vision, along with our investments
in people and infrastructure for data analytics, has laid the groundwork for the success of our digital bank today as
well as FNB's increased use of AI in the future. What began with QR code-enabled product boxes has evolved
into an omni-channel experience with our proprietary eStore. Paired with our new common application, we can
bundle products and streamline the application process, enabling customers to open 30 products with one
application, creating efficiencies and significantly reducing the number of keystrokes for our clients.
Our strategy offers us the opportunity to align high-value product solutions for our customers based upon need in
a bundled manner, which helps retain and attract clients. FNB also leverages our investments in data
infrastructure and analytics for driving revenue growth through enhanced lead generation. Our enterprise data
warehouse stores over 71 billion records across 41,000 attributes, enabling our data scientists to utilize machine
learning more effectively. We developed Opportunity IQ, our proprietary tool that utilizes AI in data aggregation to
produce a one-page snapshot of our customers, including leads for next best product to offer in an overall need.
This at-a-glance insight enables our employees to have elevated conversations and deepen our relationships with
data-driven knowledge.
Leveraging our proprietary data and analytics within our common app, we can improve product penetration
through tailored offerings to our customers to increase their financial well-being and client loyalty to our brands.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
As we continue to expand our current relationships and gain new households, FNB remains steadfast in our
consistent underwriting standards and credit management process.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to provide additional information on our credit risk metrics. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
We ended the quarter with our asset quality metrics remaining at solid level. Total delinquency finished the
quarter at 64 basis points, down 6 bps from the prior quarter. NPLs and OREO decreased1 basis point to end at
33 bps, a multiyear low with net charge-offs of 16 basis points. I'll provide an update on our CRE portfolios and
conclude with an overview of our credit risk management strategies and focus around the current environment.
Total provision expense for the quarter stood at $13.9 million, providing for loan growth and charge-offs. Our
ending funded reserve stands at $406 million or 1.25% of loans, flat compared to the prior quarter, continuing to
reflect our strong position relative to our peers. When including our unamortized loan discount, our reserve stands
at 1.36% and our NPL coverage position remained strong at 425% inclusive of the discounts.
We continue to closely monitor the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio. And on a monthly basis review upcoming
maturities, largest exposures, and analyze overall market performance across our footprint. At quarter end,
delinquency and NPLs for the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio improved slightly and continue to remain very
low at 19 basis points and 13 basis points, respectively.
Specifically related to the non-owner occupied office portfolio, our most recent review reflected a 60% weighted
average LTV, providing additional protection for potential market declines. Delinquency and NPLs were 3 basis
points and 2 basis points, respectively, outperforming the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio reflected solid performance for the quarter at 9 basis
points, confirming our consistent underwriting and strong sponsorship. We remain focused on credit risk
management along with consistent underwriting, which allows us to maintain a balanced, well-positioned portfolio
throughout various economic cycles.
On a quarterly basis, we continued to perform specific, in-depth reviews of our portfolios as well as full portfolio
stress tests. Our stress testing results for this quarter have again shown lower net charge-offs and stable
provision compared to the prior quarter's results with our current ACL covering approximately 90% of our
projected charge-offs in a severe economic downturn. Again, confirming that our diversified loan portfolio enables
us to withstand various stressed economic scenarios.
In closing, our asset quality metrics ended the quarter at good levels. Our loan portfolio continues to remain stable
and benefits from proactive risk management being further enhanced by experienced banking teams and tenured
leadership, which have successfully managed through many economic cycles. We continue to seek loan growth
through a diversified mix of products and geographies while maintaining our strong core credit philosophy and
consistent approach to underwriting through the cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remark.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning.
Today, I will review the first quarter's financial results and walk through our second quarter and full year guidance.
Total loans and leases ended the quarter at $32.6 billion, a 3.3% annualized linked quarter increase driven by
growth of $209 million in consumer loans and $53 million in commercial loans and leases. Residential mortgages-
led consumer loan growth driven by on-balance sheet production this quarter in physicians and jumbo mortgage
loans.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $34.7 billion, a slight increase of $24 million linked quarter even with the
headwind of seasonal deposit outflows. For context, our seasonal deposits peaked in mid-November and
troughed in mid-February, and balances should continue to build through the next couple of quarters benefiting
from normal seasonality and our team's success driving deeper market penetration on an organic basis.
As of March 31, noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 29% of total deposits, maintaining the same level as
year-end. While the deposit mix continues to shift from low interest checking and savings products into higher
yielding CD and money market products, we believe we will continue to outperform the industry in both the mix
and deposit cost perspective. Our deposit cost ended the first quarter at 2.04%, leading to a total cumulative
deposit beta of 36% since the current interest rate increases began in March of 2022.
The first quarter's net interest margin was 3.18%, a decline of only 3 basis points. A 15-basis-point increase in the
total yield on earning assets to 5.40% was slightly more than offset by 19-basis-point increase in the total cost of
funds to 2.33%. On a monthly basis, net interest margin was down a modest 1-basis-point per month during the
first quarter, and March's net interest margin was 3.17%. Net interest income totaled $319 million, a $5 million
decrease from the prior quarter with over half the difference due to the current quarter having one less day.
Turning to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income totaled a robust $87.9 million with linked quarter
growth in nearly every line of business. Wealth Management revenues increased 12% compared to the prior
quarter, reaching a record $19.6 million through continued strong contributions across the geographic footprint.
Mortgage Banking operations totaled $7.9 million, the highest quarterly figure since 2021, with our focus on the
purchase market driving good production growth. Several of the lines of business Vince mentioned had strong
performance this quarter. Our debt capital markets platform, which is part of Capital Markets, had a record
number of bond transactions this quarter and more than double the prior record.
Treasury Management revenues have gained momentum as we execute on our strategic initiatives building out
the platform with total TM revenues increasing around 19% from the year-ago quarter, driving the increase in the
service charge line item.
Operating noninterest expense totaled $234.1 million, an increase of $15.2 million (sic) [$16.2 million] from the
prior quarter after adjusting for $3 million of significant items in the current quarter and $46.6 million last quarter.
This quarter's significant items included $1.2 million of branch consolidation expenses and $4.4 million estimated
for the additional FDIC special assessment, partially offset by $2.6 million reduction to the previously estimated
loss on the indirect auto loan sale that closed in February.
The largest driver for operating noninterest expense was salaries and employee benefits, which increased $15
million primarily related to normal seasonal long-term compensation expense of $6.9 million, seasonally higher

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
employer-paid payroll taxes, which increased $4.6 million, and reduced salary deferrals given seasonally lower
loan origination volumes.
As previously mentioned, FNB redeemed all of our outstanding Series E Perpetual Preferred Stock on February
15 and paid the final preferred dividend of $2 million on the redemption date. The excess of the redemption value
over the carrying value on the Preferred Stock of $4 million was considered a significant item impacting earnings.
FNB continues to actively manage our capital position for ample flexibility to grow the balance sheet and optimize
shareholder returns while appropriately managing risk. Our financial performance and capital management
strategy resulted in our TCE ratio reaching 8% and CET1 ratio at 10.2%, both record levels.
Tangible book value per common share was $9.64 at March 31, an increase of $0.98 or 11.3% compared to
March 31, 2023. AOCI reduced the tangible book value per common share by $0.70 as of quarter end compared
to $0.87 for the year-ago quarter.
Let's now look at guidance for the second quarter and full year of 2024. We are maintaining our full year balance
sheet guidance. We project period ending loans to grow mid-single digits on a full year basis as we increase our
market share across our diverse geographic footprint. And total projected deposit balances are expected to grow
low-single digits on a year-over-year spot basis.
Overall, our projected full-year income statement guide is consistent with last quarter with some additional
thoughts on where we expect to land within the provided ranges. Our projected full year net interest income is still
expected to be between $1.295 billion and $1.345 billion assuming two 25-basis-point rate cuts occurring in the
latter half of 2024. Our current expectation is to be in the lower half of the full-year guide given those two rate
cuts, but where we ultimately end up in the range may change due to the fluidity of the rate environment and the
number and timing of interest rate cuts that actually occur. Second quarter net interest income is projected
between $315 million and $325 million.
The noninterest income full-year guide remains between $325 million and $345 million. However, given the strong
momentum in the first quarter, we anticipate being in the upper half of that range. The second quarter noninterest
income guide is between $80 million and $85 million.
Full year guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between $895 million and $915 million with the
second quarter noninterest expense expected to be between $220 million to $230 million.
Full-year provision guidance is $80 million to $100 million and is dependent on net loan growth and charge-off
activity. Lastly, the full-year effective tax rate should be between 21% and 22%, which does not assume any
investment tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

FNB had a good start to the year and we are optimistic that as we enter the second half of the year we have the
potential to return to positive operating leverage and benefit from a more favorable interest rate environment as
well as a growing pipeline for loans and deposits.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] And our first question today comes from Frank Schiraldi from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with
your question.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hi, Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...on the NII. Well, on the NII guide and also on the loan-to-deposit ratio, I think in the past you've talked about as
you get up to 95%, 96% taking some potential actions to help mitigate getting up to 100% loan-to-deposit ratio.
And so, I know there's some seasonality on the deposit side, but just curious maybe if you could talk about what
some of those actions might be. I know you had the indirect sale, indirect auto sale, which I guess helped a bit.
But just curious if you could talk about what some of those potential actions might look like. And then, also just
remind us of what you get on a 25-basis-point cut in interest rates. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, I would say on the loan-to-deposit ratio, Frank, we've historically talked about 97% kind of a level where we've
taken action, and the action was leveraging our franchise we have to generate deposit. So, that time that had
happened we generated close to $1 billion in CDs to kind of bring it back down into the kind of [indiscernible]
(00:22:30).

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
The 100% is a line but 97% is a line that we would kind of manage, and we kind of managed it down. And there's
a lot of things we can do. I mean, as you know, we have a big focus on generating deposit, demand deposits
throughout the company, our traditional commercial businesses, treasury management, small business it's a
focus throughout the company. It's always been. So, generating additional deposits, bringing in new households,
new customer, commercial clients is a key part of it. And then also things like managing the book [audio gap]
(00:23:02). We've adjusted our pricing strategy kind of midyear last year to create more saleable product out of
our originations than what we've had them before. And now, we're up in the mid-40s for saleable percentage
where we were let alone in the 20s. So, that's another lever we have. And the indirect business, while we did a
sale, we also have a lever there as far as how much we want to grow at this point in time, depending on kind of
what's the shelf space on the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
There are a whole list of things if we look at both asset and liability. So, there's a – Vince mentioned many of
them. I think our pipeline for new production is pretty strong from a deposit perspective. So, I don't think that we're
worried about that. So, obviously, in the event that we need to generate deposits, there's pricing mechanisms that
we could deploy, but we prefer to grow organically and try to bring in a balanced mix and deposits that are
accretive. That is going very well for the companies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then just on the NII side. I mean, I guess you have one less rate cut baked into your expectations now,
but guiding towards the lower half of the previous range. Is that just given where you sit in the first quarter and
then the trends from here or I guess I would be – I assume you still pick up a little bit potentially from less rate
cuts baked into your guide. So, just curious the driver there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You mentioned it pretty well, Frank, actually. [indiscernible] (00:24:54) the key drivers. I mean, in our guidance in
January, we had three cuts. One of them was December, so December falls off, which doesn't have much of an
impact to the full year. So, the two cuts we have in the second half of the year, in the short-term, is positive given
we're still in an asset-sensitive position. We've been organically moving back towards neutral. So, in the short-
term, there's a benefit from having that cut.
The guide we adjusted in the first quarter, we were at the lower end of our range for net interest income. The
timing of our seasonal deposits, average borrowings were a little higher just because of the timing of that. But by
the end of the quarter, we were back to flat up a little bit. So, kind of just capturing that first quarter as we look
ahead. And now, there's – we'll see.
Interest rate environment is very fluid. There's potential for us to beat that if the loan growth is stronger. That's
kind of what baked in there. There's opportunity for us to be above that. But just kind of where we sit, how we
started the year, we thought it was appropriate to kind of guide, and it's the bottom half, it's not the bottom of the
range. It's kind of the lower half of the range is what we had guided to.

Right. Okay. And then just – so to confirm there, you'd be – the third rate cut was late in the year really, didn't. So,
going from three to two rate cuts really just doesn't have an impact given the timing of the rate cuts.

question.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess first just wanted to dig into the office loans. Appreciate the detail you, guys,
gave there. And you touched on it in your comments. The delinquency in the NPLs for the office loans came down
in the quarter. I guess first I was just wondering if there was anything in particular that happened that drove that,
there were sales or what. And then just curious on the small increase in the criticized portion of the office loans, if
there's any other details you can provide there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Daniel. The slight increase was really one credit that we moved into that category. At this point, it's not a
concern for us. It's a credit that is extended out already another five years. It was originally underwritten at 52%
LTV and it's fixed through a swap at 4.5%. So, they had one tenant move out. They're working on replacing that,
but we felt it's appropriate naturally to replace that in a rated credit situation. The LTV on it was, like I said, right at
about 50% going into the [indiscernible] (00:28:02). So, that increased that 9% criticized to right around 11%.
In terms of the portfolio, the portfolio in office was down $37 million in exposure and down $15 million from a
balance perspective. So, we have seen some loans pay-off in that category as we're managing that book of
business. And with the performance of it, where we sit today at those very low levels, we'll continue to be
aggressive around it and manage it appropriately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Appreciate that. And then maybe, Vince, on the swaps that you have in place that are
going to impact 2025, just curious if you could provide a little color on how much impact that you expect those, the
rolling off, to potentially have on the margin in 2025?

There's $1 billion, $1.2 billion of swaps we have that will mature throughout 2025, $1 billion actually within 2025,
and those are – we have received rates are around 75 basis points to 1% currently, and we put those on a while
ago. Roughly we didn't do a lot of it, but we had some of that that we did put on.
So, that negative drag will come off really starting in January. There's $250 million that comes off in January, and
then the rest of them by October. The rest of the $1 billion kind of rolls off. So, that'll be additive. I can't do that
math in my head, but it's next year.

help with fee growth.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. You hit the nail on the head. Diversification is the answer. We've built out a pretty broad set of fee-based
businesses over the last decade. Capital Markets I mentioned in the prepared comments. We added a debt
capital markets platform, so we could participate in bond economics for some of our larger clients. And as you
know, the Capital Markets opened up and there was quite a bit of activity there in the first quarter. So, we
benefited from that business unit that we built out a few years ago.
Syndications, ebbs and flows. But as the pipelines build, our pipelines are up about 15%. I would expect there to
be more syndications activity as we move through the latter half of the year. So, we'll get some benefit there. We
have a pretty robust derivatives program where we have structuring teams in the marketplace that provide
counsel to clients and help them address interest rate risk, and that particular group did pretty well this quarter.
So, surprisingly, given the rate environment, they were able to do some interesting things for clients to help them
as we move through this volatile rate cycle.
The mortgage company, one of the strategies we mentioned is kind of goes back to Frank Schiraldi's comment
about the balance sheet and how we manage loan-to-deposit ratios. But we became much more aggressive on
saleable mortgage loan pricing. We gave up a little bit of margin, but quite a bit off the balance sheet. So, they're
contributing from a pure volume perspective because we're positioned in some very attractive markets to continue
to see a lot of purchase money activity where in our legacy markets there's not a lot of inventories. We're not
seeing a lot of action. But in the other markets in the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic regions, we've seen quite a
bit of pickup. So, that's contributed.
SBA had a very solid quarter. Some of the loans that we originated with higher yields in the construction phase
that were built basically based on building something out or had construction draws associated with them became
saleable. So, we moved some of that off with a decent gain.
And then, the Treasury Management business that we've been talking about, we received a lot of Greenwich
awards for Treasury Management over the last few years in the small business and middle market segments in
particular. We continue to build out that business unit. We've added personnel. We built out our merchant
services business, so we're getting nice contributions from merchant.
And kind of the strategy here was to offset the consumer fees that we see declining like overdraft fees and other
fee with higher value fees for customers from our – that sort of premium. But we kind of focused on building that
out from a Treasury Management perspective. And then, going after small businesses, we have 90,000 to
100,000 small businesses in our portfolio and we have a tremendous opportunity to go in and drive a broader
relationship through the eStore. So, we're now focusing on building out a bundled product for small business
that'll include Treasury Management and merchant as part of the bundle.
So, those are the things that – I mean, there's a lot of work that goes into it. We've got quite a bit of granularity,
and it gives us confidence that we can hit the upper end of the range on the guide, I think it's $350 million, right?
[ph] Is that what you said (00:34:26)?

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, I really appreciate all the color. Thank you so much. Maybe a last question for me switching back to the
balance sheet is on deposit. It seems like, if I'm reading your prepared commentary correctly, some of the kind of
qualification to NII to lower half of the range has to do with what you're seeing on the deposit flow side.
So, can you remind me the seasonality you have with deposits? And is there any color you can provide as to the
cadence of what you're thinking about in terms of customer deposit growth to get to that low-single digit range that
you reiterated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think, first of all, there is an extreme amount of seasonality within the deposit portfolio. So it's kind of
difficult to look at the first quarter and draw conclusions between the outflows and inflows that are occurring
throughout the quarter, and really it starts build now. So, we're starting to see considerable [indiscernible]
(00:35:49). The demand deposits were pretty steady at about 29% I think, right, on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
So, imagine that's the core of our profitability, it's basically maintaining those noninterest-bearing deposits.
What's happened over the last few quarters is we've seen some of the higher priced deposit categories moving
into CDs or moving into something with a little bit of term within the customer base. So, that's eroded a little bit of
the net interest income, right? We saw that happen. That's not surprising. You can see it in the escalation in the
betas.
I believe that, over time, throughout the course of this year we should be able to manage the noninterest bearing
deposit balances within that range and grow the other categories without sacrificing margin because we've seen
some lower pricing stick in the marketplace. We [ph] have to be as hot (00:36:49) on the pricing.
So, I think that should help us as we move through the rest of the year and then also the inflows that occur. In
many instances, even with the municipal deposits, this is the truth for just about all of them. We don't do those
transactions with municipalities to just get our balances. We kind of have a rule here where we have to be the
primary disbursement bank for those entities. And what ends up happening is the increased activity with ACH
activity and wire activity and the movement of funds increasing the amount of free balances grow to cover those
services. So, that's part of what happens over the course of the next three quarters as well.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of the exposure in D.C., we have essentially one transaction in the D.C. market. We had a few on
top of that over the last year. We've been able to move those off the balance sheet just in the normal course of
refinance at other institutions. So, we only have one transaction there and it's a transaction that's a $20 million
loan. And that's a market that we saw quite a while ago that we felt was extremely overheated. So, we were very
cautious going into that market, and we're pleased with where we sit today with very, very little exposure to that.

question.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hi, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
So, just a couple. Maybe, Gary, just one for you on the credit side just in terms of overall trends in criticized and
classified levels. Can you give any just broad characterization of how trends went this quarter just before we see
the 10-Q filing, just on kind of how those trends were for the whole portfolio rather than just the specific bucket?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of the criticized trends, they were up slightly but less than t seven or eight credits. In the criticized,
we got a couple moved in to the substandard. I touched on one of them earlier, Brian. Those credits basically
were from just some slight softer performance.
We're very aggressive in moving those type of credits into a special mention category, which was primarily where
the movement was. And we don't have any concerns with any of those credits that moved into there from a loss
14

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
perspective, long-term customers, just a little softer performance. And so, we built a little bit of reserve against
that softer performance. We expect that to turn around over the next 6 to 12, 18 months in terms of those
particular movements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And, Brian, I have a tremendous amount of confidence in Gary and his team. I can tell you, as we look at the
portfolio, Gary is on top of the credits. His people are on top of the credits. The line looks at these credits and they
downgrade them if necessary very quickly. That's different than what you'll find in other companies.
So, you're going to see movements. I think it's positive because it keeps us well reserved relative to risk. So, I
think as you look over long periods of time, and Gary has been in the seat for a long time, [indiscernible]
(00:42:02) 14, 15 years, maybe longer, right? [indiscernible] (00:42:08). I'm getting old. It's 15 years and you were
there 16 years.
Yeah, we're all vibrant. So, we've got a long track record to look at. Our delinquencies are surprisingly at historical
lows. The overall quality of the portfolio appears to be good. We are focusing on certain segments that we believe
globally are soft. You'd mentioned office. That's one area we look at, we focus on. But thank goodness we have
tremendous granularity and a prompt – a credit culture that encourages prompt action.
And I think that's what you're seeing. There was a slide we presented I think in the past, I don't know if it's in the
deck, with charge-offs versus reserve build for us. We tend to be very early at reserving and then our charge-offs
end up better than the peers. So, that's a testament to Gary and his team. Getting out early, addressing situations
early helps you get out of trouble, so that you're not experiencing the charge-offs down the road. Waiting and not
addressing issues creates a shortfall, which exacerbates credit problems when you're in a cycle.
So, I don't know. I think we've done a great job. He won't say that, but I'm going to say it about him.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No, I appreciate. The numbers speak for themselves, Vince and Gary, I mean, they're great and even the
criticized not being up much is a testimony to kind of the portfolio and the granularity. So, just trying to stay in front
of it if there's things that are coming down the pipe.
Gary, you mentioned the stress testing. Was there anything specific you guys stress tested this quarter that you
would call out or just in general that you just continue to stress test the entire portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's a general stress test of the entire portfolio on a loan level basis, Brian. So, it is a really deep dive every quarter
that Tom Fisher and his team undertakes. We review that every quarter. Updates are made on a monthly basis
when necessary. So, it keeps us forward-looking from that perspective. And I think it's a best practice that we put
into place that has been very beneficial as we look forward through the economy and what we expect down the
road.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one or two others. So just on – the two things. On the loan side, just
maybe just kind of how the pipelines – I appreciate the guidance for the year. Just kind of just trying to get a feel
for where the pipelines are today on the commercial side primarily. And then I think you mentioned on the
mortgage side, you were a bit more aggressive on the sales. I mean, first quarter is typically a seasonally weaker
quarter. So, I guess, do you expect to remain aggressive on the sales, which could mean that potentially 1Q is a
bottom for the mortgage revenues as you look throughout the year? Any difference in strategy there as you go to
the balance of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think the first quarter typically is seasonally slower, right, because they're less especially when we're
focusing on purchase money mortgage loans because there are fewer transactions that occur in the first quarter. I
would expect that to build through the next two quarters and then come back down again.
Just speaking to the purchase money side with conforming mortgage loans. I would expect that to happen. There
are other origination areas that will produce through that. We have physicians loans that we do, which are pretty
much throughout the year. So, they kind of offset some of the declines in the later half of the year on the
conforming stuff. So, you'll see more jumbo private banking loans coming online, which is why we do what we do.
We want to balance out what goes on the balance sheet and what becomes sale of that.
Our team has done a great job. We have terrific people in the mortgage business. We've grown it over the last 10
years or so. I mean, it's a big part of our business and a key product for the consumer. So, it really adds to our
ability to obtain clients. And I think we're going to continue to focus on it and manage it very conservatively. But I
would expect that to contribute more over the next few quarters. I think it's fair to say given the seasonality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I would just add from an income statement standpoint. I mean, baked into our guidance is the Mortgage
Banking income coming down a little bit from the first quarter level. That was going to be a function of how much
we do sell, right, and we'll continue to manage it, like Vince said. Seasonally, second and third quarter, not quite a
big lift in production, which is what's baked into our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Yeah. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But I'm pretty optimistic. I think they're doing pretty well and we're very well entrenched. We have great people in
that business like I said, so I feel good about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

and third as Vince said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Obviously impacted by interest rates, Brian, right? I mean, that if rates go, that's game over. We'll talk about it
down the road. But I think given the way things are today in a stable interest rate environment for now, they
should pick up. There should be more activity [indiscernible] (00:47:50).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Got you. And just on the commercial pipeline, what you're seeing there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The pipelines, they're up 15%. The overall pipeline is up from the last quarter. Remember, we had a big order
closing out in December of last year. So, the fourth quarter last year was pretty solid from a production
perspective. So, pipelines are rebuilding. South Carolina is at their second highest level historically, so there's a
lot of activity there. Raleigh has got a nice pipeline. What we call the capital region, which is the central part of the
state, has a tremendous pipeline. And we've seen some good activity in some of the rural Pennsylvanian markets.
The folks in State College, Tony Marfisi and his team is doing a terrific job. I mean we're seeing a lot of activity
and good solid middle-market C&I opportunities. So, I would expect us to continue to build the pipeline as we
move through the year and businesses hopefully become more confident in the economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And the last one for me and I'll step back. It was just the – it sounds like the DDA level you're
comfortable that you can maybe sustain this around the current level. And then, just kind of the outlook on the
capital flexibility with kind of reaching a record level of TCE and CET1, just kind of your thoughts on capital
deployment here, if it's still just primarily organic growth.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Yeah. I would say, I mean, on the capital front, we still like 10% is our CET1 target. We think that's the right level
just given our risk profile of the balance sheet and also the higher level of capital generation that we've been
producing. If you look at what's baked into our guidance, the capital ratios kind of gradually build from here
between now and the end of the year. As you saw this quarter, we had a nice pickup in the CET1 and TCE ratio.
And we had commented in January that once the indirect sale kind of cleared, that would be additive. That is like
10 basis points CET1 [indiscernible] (00:49:59) to the TCE ratio.
So, we have that and then we'll kind of gradually build from there. And we'll be opportunistic as we have been in
the past and we'll look to introduce some buybacks. We have issuance of stock in the first quarter from normal
incentive stuff. We could repurchase some of that and look to do some level of activity as we go through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Given the profitability of the company, we have options and we're building capital and you go back pretty far. So.
8% is a pretty nice number for us.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
I just wanted to make one comment. There was a question earlier about the swaps that we have rolling off next
year. I mentioned kind of what we're seeing and we're paying $544 million on that $1 billion. So, just as far as the
math, as you get into 2025, it's basically $250 million a quarter kind of sub 1% of what we're receiving and we're
paying around $544 million. So, that'll be a benefit next year starting in January. Just wanted to clarify that.
