Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you very much. Welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call. As mentioned with me are Dave
Dykstra, Dave Stoehr; Kate Boege, Tim Crane; and Rich Murphy. We have the same format as we [ph] instituted
(00:01:45) earlier this year. I'm going to give some general comments regarding our results, go over to Tim Crane
for more detail on the balance sheet and to Dave Dykstra for other income and other expense, and Rich Murphy
will discuss credit, back to me for some summary comments and thoughts on the future and then time for
questions.
On the overview, all in all, very successful quarter. I could almost give the same comments made at the end of
Q2, at the end of last April, at the start of the pandemic and the government's massive response to it. [ph] I
indicated Wintrust support – was going to attempt to grow through it (00:02:24). Today, we've accomplished this
goal, and as such, the quarter shows the strategy is working. All our growth today has been organic.
Second quarter was another all around $1 billion quarter. Assets, deposits, core loans, net of PPP loans, all grew
by over $1 billion. Both price mix remain very good. Of particular note, [ph] core loan growth result in overall
increase in total (00:02:50) loans for the quarter even after PPP runoff.
We were able to achieve another $1 billion loan quarter in Q4, which we believe is more than a reasonable
assumption given our pipelines, which, by the way are a 13-month high at quarter-end. [ph] We will fully replace
all the (00:03:11) PPP balances. This is our intent before we embarked on the strategy.
Net income for the quarter was $109 million or $1.77 per diluted common share. Year-to-date, we said $367.4
million or $6 per share. Reported net interest margin decreased 4 basis points to 2.59%, primarily due to excess
liquidity. Net interest income was up $19.7 million from quarter two, [ph] if you back out (00:03:43) the PPP loan
income, and total net interest income was up almost $8 million over quarter two.
Period end loans exceeded average loans of the quarter by [ph] $670 million (00:03:53), which bodes well for Q4.
Our liquidity portfolio is up $1.563 billion on average [indiscernible] (00:04:01) very short, remains very short, over
$5.2 billion overhead money at the Fed. Investing this money [ph] is wage rise is a (00:04:11) lever we can pull
when the time is right.
[indiscernible] (00:04:15) business as our current pipelines. [ph] Line usage (00:04:19) remains low, a little over
39% is up around 1% from the end of quarter two. [indiscernible] (00:04:26) hopefully hit bottom [ph] on this thing
and the line usage started to (00:04:28) increase. [indiscernible] (00:04:34) close to 50% return to normal to add
another $1 billion in outstanding loans. Credit quality [indiscernible] (00:04:41) charge-offs totaling like net zero.
We had some charge-offs, but we had recoveries which shows – should indicate [indiscernible] (00:04:51) good
on recovery. NPLs and NPs were constant versus Q2. NPLs was $2.5 million to $90 million or 27 basis points
while [ph] NPAs shrunk $2.5 million at (00:05:07) 22 basis points. This, plus improved portfolio quality
[indiscernible] (00:05:19) overall economy [indiscernible] (00:05:21) $7.9 million. Mortgage increased,
experienced some growth in the quarter. Dave will discuss in detail. [indiscernible] (00:05:32) steady improvement
fees of $1 million quarter-to-quarter, up $18 million year-to-date.
I'll turn the call over to Tim who's going to provide [indiscernible] (00:05:46) detail on the balance sheet. Tim?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Good. Thanks, Ed. I'd like to briefly highlight a few balance sheet items as well as cover two topics that appear to
be of interest. First, with respect to the balance sheet, total assets increased to just under $48 billion as we
continue to experience strong growth. As Ed mentioned, loans excluding PPP grew $1.2 billion during the quarter,
essentially mirroring last quarter's growth. The growth was spread across virtually all loan categories, as Rich will
discuss in a few minutes. On a percentage basis, this is the second straight quarter where annualized loan
growth, again excluding PPP, was approximately 15%.
With respect to PPP loans, we saw a reduction of approximately $800 million during the quarter. At this point,
almost all of the PPP loans originated in 2020 have been forgiven and approximately half of the loans from 2021
either have been or are in the process of being forgiven. By year-end, we project the remaining PPP balances will
be down materially and the remaining the income impact to be relatively small.
For the remainder of the year, we are comfortable with our loan growth target of mid to high-single digits on a
percentage basis. Again, Rich will provide some additional color on loan pipelines and the factors that would drive
potential upside to that number. Deposit growth for the quarter was also strong, $1.1 billion, almost all of it either
DDA or low cost deposits. This is an annualized growth rate of approximately 12%.
Despite the high levels of PPP forgiveness, we are not seeing unusual volatility in customer deposits. This
quarter, the interest-bearing deposit cost fell another 9 basis points to 29 basis points. This is largely a function of
CD repricing. Deposit costs will continue to decline, but a slower pace in coming quarters. As we've noted in prior
periods, we continue to monitor the deposit growth carefully given the high levels of liquidity in the market;
however, we view stable, low cost deposits as a strength of the company and we'll continue to pursue deposits
related to client relationships.
On the investment front, we remain very liquid. During the quarter, our securities balances were up slightly as we
replaced investments maturing, but generally have not yet moved to deploy the large amounts of excess liquidity
as we remain wary of locking in low long-term yields. As the market continues to trend up, we will evaluate our
position and view appropriate deployment of this liquidity if there's an opportunity in future periods to improve the
margin and income.
Our capital levels remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank. You will note that during the
quarter, we repurchased approximately $9.5 million worth of stock at just over $71 per share. Given where we
believe volumes and yields will land, we continue to expect that despite lower PPP accretion, net interest income
will increase as it has for four consecutive quarters and that excluding PPP, the margin will remain roughly stable.
I have two other brief comments that relate to new slides in the earnings release presentation. The first has to do
with digital adoption. You'll see on page 9 of the presentation that our high touch community banking model also
has a high tech component and that we are seeing the same increases in digital adoption and usage that some
larger banks have reported. We continue to upgrade our digital capabilities to give clients options on how they
would like to be served. These capabilities position us to compete successfully and in some cases, to differentiate
ourselves versus our competitors. Currently, you'll see that a full two-thirds of our checking clients regularly use
our digital services.
Page 10 in the presentation document is also a new slide, relates to the customer satisfaction of our commercial
clients. In this case, the source is Greenwich Data (sic) [Coalition Greenwich] (00:09:58). And as you can see,
Wintrust is top ranked across a host of important categories. To scale this for you, the 97% overall satisfaction
score Wintrust achieved compares generally to scores in the 60s and 70s for many of our competitors. The

service we provide increases the depth of our relationships and is the foundation for our strong momentum in the
Illinois and Wisconsin markets, as well as nationally in many of our niche businesses.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Tim. As Ed mentioned, I'll cover the income statement categories starting with the net interest
income. For the third quarter of 2021, net interest income totaled $287.5 million. That was an increase of $7.9
million compared to the second quarter and an increase of $31.5 million (sic) [$31.6 million] (00:10:48) as
compared to the third quarter of last year.
The $7.9 million increase in net interest income compared to the second quarter was primarily due to average
earning asset growth, which was up on an annualized basis by 12.5% over the prior quarter and one additional
day in the third quarter, which was offset somewhat by a slightly compressed net interest margins.
Net interest margin declined 4 basis points to 2.59%. The beneficial decline of 8 basis points for the rates paid on
liabilities was offset by a 10-basis-point decline on the yield on our average earning assets and a 2 basis point
decline in the net free funds contribution, which resulted in a slight decline in the net interest margin. The decline
in the earning assets in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the impact of
building short-term liquid assets. The decrease in the rate paid on net interest-bearing liabilities as compared to
the prior quarter was primarily due to a 9 basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits
primarily due to the repricing of time deposits.
I think, it's important to note that the net interest income expanded despite $11.4 million of less interest income
associated with the PPP loan portfolio in the third quarter, which included $7.8 million of lower PPP loan fee
accretion. And as Ed mentioned, our net interest margin, excluding the PPP portfolio was relatively stable as it
declined by only 1 basis point.
Turning to the provision for credit losses, like many other banks have done this quarter, Wintrust again recorded a
negative provision for credit losses of $7.9 million that compared to a directionally similar negative provision of
$15.3 million in the prior quarter and a $25 million provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter. The
negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, primarily due to improvements in
the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter, including decreases in net charge-offs and COVID-related
loan modifications and improving loan risk rating migration. Rich will cover credit quality in additional detail in just
a few minutes.
I will now talk about the non-interest income on non-interest expense and income tax sections. In the non-interest
income section, our wealth management revenue increased $841,000 to another record level of $31.5 million in
the third quarter, compared to $30.7 million in the second quarter, and that revenue was up 26% from a $25
million recorded in the year ago quarter. The revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity
valuations, which impact the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts.
Mortgage banking revenue saw a [ph] reasonable solid (00:13:48) loan origination volume during the third quarter
with origination activity fairly consistent with the second quarter of this year. To that end, the company originated
$1.6 billion of loan – mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter of 2021 down from the approximately $1.7 billion
that we originated in the prior quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
As we forecasted on our last call, mortgage banking revenue increased to $55.8 million for the third quarter of
2021 as compared to $50.6 million in the second quarter. Revenue was higher in the current quarter primarily due
to less material unfavorable fair value adjustments on our mortgage servicing right portfolio. The company
recorded a $5.5 million negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter as compared to a smaller decrease of
$888,000 in the current quarter.
Looking forward, based on market conditions and expected seasonality of home purchasing activity, we anticipate
mortgage originations for sale in the fourth quarter of 2021 to be down 20% to 30% from the origination volumes
we experienced in the third quarter, and mortgage revenue excluding the MSR valuation adjustments to be down
similarly.
Also as we saw in the first three quarters of this year, the wild card relates to mortgage banking as it relates to
mortgage banking revenue is the mortgage servicing right valuation which is tied closely to mortgage interest rate
movements. I'm not going to speculate on where those rates are going to move to, but our previous forecast of a
reduction of 20% to 30% excludes any change in the MSR valuation.
Other non-interest income totaled $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, up approximately $3.0 million from the
$20.4 million recorded in the prior quarter. The primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category include $2
million of higher swap fee revenue, $2.2 million of higher income from investments in partnerships which are
primarily related to CRA purposes, a positive swing of $859,000 in foreign exchange valuation adjustments
associated with the US/Canadian dollar exchange rate, $812,000 of higher BOLI income, and offsetting those
increases was the fact that the prior quarter included a $4 million gain on the sale of a few branch locations in
southwestern Wisconsin, and there were no such similar gains in the current quarter.
Turning to non-interest expense. Non-interest expenses totaled $282.1 million in the third quarter, up
approximately $2 million from the $280.1 million recorded in the prior quarter. There're a handful of categories that
I'll address that comprise the majority of that net increase. Salaries and employee benefits expenses actually
declined by $1.9 million in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of this year. The $1.9 million
decline is primarily related to $6.3 million of lower compensation expense associated with the mortgage banking
operation, offset somewhat by higher incentive compensation expenses for annual bonus and long-term incentive
compensation plans.
Advertising and marketing expense totaled $13.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of $2.1 million compared
to the second quarter of 2021. The increase in the third quarter relates primarily to increased sponsorship activity
for the summer months, including our Major and Minor League Baseball sponsorships and more community
events occurring. We would expect this expense level to decline in the fourth quarter as many of these
sponsorships are geared towards the summer months.
Software and equipment expense totaled $22.0 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1.2 million as
compared to the second quarter total of $20.9 million. The increase is due to increased expenses associated with
upgrading our data centers for increased capacity, scalability, and reliability, other network upgrades to support
our growth and ongoing digital enhancements and various other software upgrades. As we've done over the last
few years, we continue to invest in software and technology to enhance our customer experience and delivery
systems and products, [ph] as well as investment (00:18:14) systems to support our growth. And as Tim
mentioned, our customer satisfaction results are great. And so, I think the investment in those systems is paying
dividends.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
OREO expenses were actually negative by approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter as the company
recorded gains of approximately $1.9 million from the sale of OREO properties. These gains were an amount that
exceeded the aggregate cost of OREO expenses and valuation charges on other OREO properties.
The miscellaneous expense category totaled $23.4 million in the third quarter compared to $21.3 million in the
second quarter of this year. It's an increase of $2.2 million. The increase was primarily impacted by approximately
$1.7 million of more travel and entertainment expenses and a variety of other smaller fluctuations.
The increase in the travel and entertainment expense category was due to increased costs associated with in-
person client relationship meetings and conferences, as well as some additional expense associated with an all-
employee event to celebrate Wintrust's 30th anniversary and to thank our employees for performing quite well
during the pandemic. Although this expense category is higher in recent quarters, they're still lower than the
general run rate we had in prior periods before the pandemic began and we're encouraged to see our team
returning to more normal in-person events to build and maintain solid customer relationships. This activity is
important to maintaining the strong loan growth we've been achieving in recent quarters.
So, other than those expense categories I just discussed, all other expense categories in the aggregate were up
by less than $1 million compared to the second quarter and nothing of significance to discuss there.
The net overhead ratio, a measure of our operational efficiency, improved in the third quarter relative to the prior
quarter. The net overhead ratio stood at 1.22%, which is down 10 basis points from the 1.32% recorded in the
second quarter. The ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and good mortgage banking
results. Our current target assuming relatively normal mortgage activity is for the net overhead ratio to stay below
1.35% due to the strong balance sheet growth and the focus on expense control relative to revenue growth.
I should note that the efficiency ratio also improved in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter. The efficiency
ratio stood at 66.03% in the third quarter, a decline of 253 basis points from the prior quarter.
Moving on to income tax expense, the effective tax rate was relatively stable at approximately 27%, which is in
the range that we would consider normal.
In summary, core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth and increased net interest
income despite significant PPP loan reductions, record wealth management revenue, strong mortgage revenue,
improved net overhead and efficiency ratios, strong pipelines and very good credit quality.
So, with that summary, I'll conclude my comments and turn it over to Rich.

Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave. As noted earlier, credit performance for the second quarter was very solid from a number of
perspectives. As detailed on slide 4 of the deck, loan growth for the quarter net of PPP was $1.2 billion or 15%
annualized, well above our guidance. Equally as important was the nature of this growth which was spread across
our loan portfolio. Specifically, C&I loans were up $543 million, CRE loans which were up $207 million, Wintrust
Life which was up $296 million and FIRST Insurance Funding which was up $95 million.
Throughout the pandemic, we have seen solid and consistent loan growth. If you look at Q3 2020 compared to
Q3 2021, we have seen total loans net of PPP grow by $3.4 billion or 12%. On our last earnings call, we
expressed confidence in our ability to continue to meet or exceed our loan growth guidance because of the

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
strength of our core loan pipeline. We believe this momentum is attributable to a number of factors. The PPP halo
effect, which is really taking hold on the level of commercial loans. We have seen substantial expansion in the
numbers and amounts of treasury management relationships over the past several quarters. But it takes time to
move the entirety of the credit relationship out of the incumbent bank. We are now seeing those effects result in
outstandings.
Market disruption has been pronounced throughout this year and throughout the pandemic and we have seen
customers and bankers look to Wintrust as a consistent and preferred banking partner in Chicago and southern
Wisconsin. As a result, pipelines continue to look very strong and at the highest levels we've seen in several
years.
Finally, as detailed on slide 17, after five quarters of decreased C&I line utilization, the trend is beginning to
reverse. As noted in earlier calls, this utilization has been historically close to 50%. We saw this level bottom out
in Q2 at 38.4% and we ended Q3 at 39.3%. We believe this trend of increased usage will continue in the fourth
quarter.
As discussed in prior quarters, one of the keys to the performance and growth of our credit portfolio has been
diversification across a number of product lines. This quarter was another great example of that strategy. Our
niche products, particularly premium finance and leasing grew substantially during the pandemic. Now, we are
beginning to see very strong growth coming from our core banking customers.
In addition, slide 15 details the geographic diversification in our portfolio. As we have stated before, Wintrust has
a Chicago/Milwaukee nexus. However, as this slide illustrates, our various business lines provide us with
meaningful amount of credit opportunities outside of these primary markets.
From a credit quality perspective, as detailed on slide 16, we continue to see solid credit performance across the
portfolio as the economy stabilizes. This can be seen in a number of metrics. Non-performing loans remained flat
and are approximately $90 million or 27 basis points. NPLs continue to be at record low levels and roughly half of
where those were at this time last year. Charge-offs for the quarter were essentially zero. An amazing result,
especially when looking at total charge-offs of approximately $2 million for the past two quarters combined. And
as noted in the bottom right quadrant on page 16, credit risk ratings continue to show meaningful positive
migration as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic.
That concludes my comments on credit and I'll turn it back to Ed to wrap up.

Thanks, Murph. Those of you who examine transcripts of our earnings calls will notice a lot of similarities between
this quarter and the last [indiscernible] (00:25:06) fans of consistency. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call,
our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates, use our structural hedges like
mortgages to buffer the loss and NII until such time as balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to
lower rates. PPP loans [indiscernible] (00:25:26) add on to this strategy. All the above was to be accomplished,
while enhancing our asset sensitivity position in anticipation of eventual higher interest rates.
[ph] There's some (00:25:38) balance sheet growth that has a deposit growth of $4.1 billion year-to-date and loan
growth of $3.4 billion excluding loans held for sale and PPP. We have experienced, as Tim laid out, that has been
done totally on an organic basis.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
The acquisition market remains somewhat consistent with quarter 2 based upon the amount of inbound calls we
continue to receive, some still have very high expectations, so we'll see where this ends up. Loan pipelines
remain strong in all major categories and I said at the beginning at a 13-month high. This is aided by not only our
reputation, but also market disruption and our diversified portfolio. Our asset sensitivity position is right where we
want it. And it appears that the [indiscernible] (00:26:30) inflation is transitory, is coming to an end, and rate
increases are inevitable. The underwater beach ball will rise hopefully soon.
We continue to leg into investments with our excess liquidity, take advantage of market blips [indiscernible]
(00:26:46) total investment is likely in the lousy long-term rates doesn't make a lot of sense to us. Credit is
remarkably good. Thanks to our consistently conservative underwriting standards and diversified loan portfolio,
working both our lending line and credit folks, NPAs, NPLs are lower than they were before the start of the
pandemic. Wealth management area is delivering strong results with assets under administration continuing to
grow.
So, to date, the plan is working. We need to continue to grow in order to bring this plan to fulfillment. Organic loan
growth should remain strong to take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market. It makes sense. In short,
I like where we stand. As mentioned or we referred to in December, we will celebrate our 30th anniversary,
getting close to a $50 billion bank with $35 billion in assets under administration in our wealth management group
is beyond any thought of where we'd be at this point in time. So, we got a couple of guys in here with that original
card table and I think you could pinch us, if you knew how excited we were about, where we are and what our
prospects are going forward for the next 30 years. You can be assured our best efforts going forward. We
appreciate your continued support.
Now, we have time for some questions. So, thank you very much. Move on to questions.

What, Eastern, Central, I don't know. But just the loan growth numbers. Appreciate the guidance for the fourth
quarter, but to Murph's comments on the PPP halo market disruption, line utilization, I think I would throw in
premium financeable market in there as well. But what slows this down and what would cause you to pull back on
saying you can put up this kind of growth into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think if you see [indiscernible] (00:29:15) and rationality kicks in, and we're starting to see some of it, the bigger
banks going and just giving it away because of the dearth of earning assets out there, that could cause us to back
off a little bit because, as you know, our policy and our profitability model are [indiscernible] (00:29:34), and we're
not going to be changing those [ph] railing (00:29:37) but right now, we don't see it. We see people coming from
other banks who appreciate our long-term approach, appreciate our approach to doing business. I like to say a lot
of them just – they just thought they're having a good time [indiscernible] (00:29:54) before.
As Tim mentioned, we spent a lot of money and we do a better job of telling you how much money we spend on
our technology. Going in the fourth quarter, expect we'll give you a real detail of how much of our expenses
relates to our technology build. And winning the Greenwich Awards is really heartening to us because the
numbers we're seeing a 95% and the like of people would recommend us. That builds on itself. So, I don't think
you can see the premium finance market change that much. And Tim, I think it's going to get harder even next
year.
The market continues to get harder. People are thinking maybe 20%, 30% increase there, additional increase in
premiums on the commercial side. On the life side, we see some pricing rationality, but we stay away from those.
And with what's going on with the tax laws and the like, it's going to make life insurance a reasonable way to plan
your estate and not have to pay the exorbitant state taxes that are being proposed.
The commercial side, Murph, I don't know.

Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, you hit the nail on the head. I think that generally speaking, we like where we sit. And we think that our
positioning in the marketplace is very good. And as we alluded to, we're seeing not only customers, but also
bankers look at as a real attractive alternative. So, really good core momentum there.
I think to your question, what wrinkles are out there, as Ed said, the challenges that you look at, every one of our
competitors and they are also – they have a lot of cash to deploy. So, you are seeing pricing being very
aggressive and you're seeing structures also pretty aggressive. So, right now, we don't anticipate any type of
rope-a-dope or anything like that, but something that we are very aware of.
The other thing is on the life side, it is – because rates were so low, it really was a great opportunity for people to
use that product. And if rates were to go up dramatically here, and that's probably going to have an impact on
that. But right now, we see ourselves being – as we go into budget season, we're pretty optimistic about where we
see...

Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Leasing is good. Leasing is at a really good time during the pandemic. Anything where leasing tends to be a little
bit more of a transactional business and so people are very focused on structure and pricing. And so, we were
very mindful of that. So, we're not going to go out there and chase deals. But as you've seen, Jon, over the
course of the last three years and the way we've grown that portfolio, we're pretty optimistic of where it's
happening. It's probably the one area where we're really focused on pricing because we're – if we're going to lean
in on pricing, it's going to be for a complete relationship where you get the full share of wallet.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Good color on that. Thank you. Then I guess just one on the margin. Appreciate the
comments, Tim, on the margins being relatively stable. You alluded to the beach ball. We've heard that for a long
time. But any threats to the margin?
[indiscernible] (00:33:26)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. No. I've heard it a lot 20 years ago, but we're waiting. We're still waiting. But what can make your margin
lift? And you've alluded to maybe getting a little bit more aggressive on liquidity deployment, but still being careful.
But as we look forward to the margin, it feels like it's bottomed out here, and maybe the only way to go is up from
here. But talk a little bit about the plan, and can the margin lift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, additional liquidity would cause the margin to have additional pressure. But in terms of net interest income, I
think you're going to see that growing nicely throughout the rest of the year.
Tim, you want to comment on the...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah, I mean, Jon, we're watching pricing pretty carefully. Deposit costs will continue to help a little bit, not
as much as they have in the prior quarters. And if we get rising rates here, the 10-year is up to [ph] 1.65%
(00:34:26), we watch that closely, and we deploy some more liquidity, will help both our margin and our income.
We're patient there. So I hesitate to forecast when that might happen, but we feel pretty good. We remain very
interest-sensitive and feel like that's still an important part of the equation.

David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I was just going to say $5 billion of that liquidity, and then – and deposits keep coming in. So that's a good
lever. But I was going to also say that the new loans are sort of coming on at the existing portfolio pricing right
now. So you see a little bit of compression from some older loans paying off at higher rates. But the new loans are
coming on. So I think we've stabilized on the loan side substantially. And so, ex-PPP, it should have – like you
said, should have roughly bottomed out and we have the upside from the deployment. So, we're optimistic on that
front.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Young from Truist Securities. Your
question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to do a quick follow-up on just the excess liquidity. That $5 billion or
so and just kind of cash basically on the balance sheet, it seems like at current rates you could deploy that maybe
for 150 basis point kind of pick up over cash yields. So, by my math, that's maybe $0.75 or so of earnings to $1 of
earnings. Is that kind of the right way to think about it? But then maybe if you could deploy that into loans instead
maybe to $1.50 or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, yeah. Mike, I think the concept is right. I mean, as you said, you're earning roughly 15 basis points and,
yeah, mortgage backs are plus or minus 2% right now. So there's your spread differential for investing. The
biggest question is, do you want to invest long term at that rate or do you want to wait for it to go up? But it's
pretty simple math. It's 15 basis points and decide what asset class you want invested in and at what rates. So on
the loan, it would probably be closer to 3%, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We think that we were showing solid growth in NII by the growth that we're having. I think that we're kidding
ourselves if we believe we're not at the start or in the – even in the first quarter of an inflationary cycle. Wages are
rising. I sit on a couple of boards and we talk to them and price increases are flying through. They're not going to
go backwards. Supply chain disruption plus lack of labor is going to cause this cycle to start. Once it starts and
gets some momentum, it's hard to stop. You stop it by higher rates. The government has to taper eventually, in
which case, because of our deposit base at a higher rate – and the lower rates you're playing like in the red zone.
Higher rates, you're going to get normal spreads anyhow.
So to lock in long term at 2%, although it could make us money now but hurt us down the road. So we look at –
we take a long-term view and there's also the possibility that at the end of the year people start moving money
out, there's so much money out there, they move it out. Hopefully they'll keep it in the bank. You never know
where it's going to go. We have to keep a little bit of excess liquidity because of that, I think.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
So it's really unprecedented times in terms of the liquidity side of the equation. But they're not impressive in terms
of the inflationary cycle we're starting to see start. And this – you can't fight the economics of it all, you can try to
say it's new economics, what are you going to do? We're old school guys and we believe that I'd rather lock in at
5% or 6% and the way up than at 2% right now. Because of our deposit base being very retail and – well, just
retail nature of the deposit base and the – all could come basically 90-some-odd percent is all core of deposits,
we can lag on the way up and we can make a lot more money then.
So, we've taken a long-term measured approach on this. We could drop it in and make another $1 a share, a
couple of dollars a share take over time. But I don't think that's prudent to do given that we think that down the
road, make a lot of more money to the company and for the shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for all that color. And just kind of my follow-up question, you segued it nicely into just inflation. It's
been a long time since we've seen material inflation and just curious kind of your high level thoughts maybe on
inflation and then how that could affect the expense base and kind of growth there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think the government wants inflation. They've got all the money they're borrowing, they want to pay back in
cheaper dollars. So, we've seen the movie and kind of think it's not going to have a different ending. I think it's
going to be there for a period of time. I think the cycle has started. It's hard to stop the cycle without raising rates
and slowing things down a bit. Kind of in a conundrum because of the – we're not out of the pandemic yet. Supply
chain issues are causing some of this. I don't think they'll be over by the end of next year according to some of the
boards I'm on and the manufacturing I'm talking to, between those and force majeure, everything else going on.
It's tough out there for our clients and labor is tough, they have to pay a lot more money to get people in the
house. Transportation is tough out there right now. You can be a truck driver and make $150,000 a year and
some of the offerings that are out there now.
So I think inflation is here and it's going to stay and we have to be ready for it. And when you have inflation, you
have to make more money than you did before just to save it, right? So that's our plan. That's what we're doing,
we're sticking to it, and I just think I've seen the movie. I can't tell it's going to end any differently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
And, Dave, maybe any thoughts on your expense base specifically and how that all affect kind of our outlook for
2022 or 2023 kind of expense growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think I'd look at it, Michael, is that if the inflation really kicks into the expense base and rates rise, the increase in
the margins going to more than offset the expenses and our efficiency ratio will get better and our net operating
ratios, et cetera, will actually probably get better because of the growth in the assets and the growth in the
margins. So, yeah, our biggest cost is labor cost. So, we just – if you see increases in labor costs, then we'll have
that go up. But the rest of them we should be able to control reasonably well. But I just think the margin will
expand dramatically more than the expenses, if inflation does kick in.

please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
How are you, Terry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good. Thank you. Maybe I'd start with [ph] table 8 (00:42:39), your interest rate sensitivity. I'm just wondering how
your underlying deposit betas maybe have changed this cycle versus the past. And when I look at the 83% loan to
deposit ratio and that includes PPP, how much are you assuming you can lag on deposit rates when rates rise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, we're pleased that a third of the deposits are DDA. And obviously, the bulk of the rest of it is very
low rate at this point. I think we will lag as rates move up. Hard to predict what will happen kind of with the PPP
money. Again to my comments earlier, we've not seen anything unusual with respect to deposit volatility. I think it
will continue to help us. I think for the next couple of quarters, you'll see deposit costs go down almost in spite of
what happens to rates. And we should be in good shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I think, Terry, if my recollection is right, the last time we have rising rates from the near zero
environment, the first 25 basis points, really there wasn't much of a rise on deposit costs. And the second 25
basis point increase was the same and we only started to see increases with the third increase. And I would think
that it would be similar to that, if not even a longer lag because there's way more liquidity in the system right now
and people aren't as anxious to bring deposits in. So I think if history repeats itself you'd have at least 50 basis
point increase before you'd see much movement by the industry. And my personal opinion is because of our
liquidity in the system, but that might go well beyond that before you see much of an increase in deposit costs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And, Terry, if it helps, virtually none of our deposits are linked to an index, so.

That's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, we all know there's a large acquisition about to close later this
year in your market and a new name about to enter your market. So, I guess my question is, how quickly did you
start to see the disruption from the last deal, MBFI, and how long did that window remain open for a bank like
Wintrust to capitalize on any opportunities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we're starting to see a little of it. The window stays open for a long time. I mean, our people gave it a year to
see if it's going to work or not, really let loose on our pursuit of these guys. On a previously announced deal, it
took about four or five years before we started seeing an outflow. So, you can guess which one that is, but you
can never really get anybody on the old place and now we're getting people and assets that we never thought
we'd get to a very loyal to the old place. So, we'll be relentless on it and we'll see.
Murph, any thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I think that's right. It's really kind of the tone that gets set by the acquiring institution. And we've seen it run the
gamut from the day that a deal gets announced and they come in and they immediately change the credit culture
and just the overall tone of the organization. But as Ed points out, we've seen the other side where it takes a
while, but eventually things change and people – more customers and bankers sense that change and look to find
something a little more in keeping with the way they like to be treated. So I don't think there's one set answer to
the question, but it is inevitable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Word of mouth has been great for us. I mean, these awards we're getting from Greenwich are very, very helpful.
Plus, we walk the walk. We don't just talk the talk. People come over and they see our technology and what we
have, I'll put up against the big banks for the most part. We're better than them because of the personal service
we give on top of it. And I get nothing but complimentary letters about how happy people are when they get over
here. [ph] So, I'd say, to stop there. They were having a (00:47:11) good time before, but now they really are
having a good time. So, word of mouth is happening a lot too. Plus, I think our advertising is paying off as
Chicago's bank and Wisconsin's bank and they have great momentum there, but we got to back that up. We have
been backing it up. And the people, we are seeing people from all the acquired organizations asking us what our
plans are, what we're going to do, and there's great interest on their part.
Another thing is with remote working, it's helped us like on the IT side. [ph] We were able to pick up a (00:47:51)
number of people just because [ph] of our (00:47:53) reputation. We picked up a couple out in New York who
heard – who just heard how good we were to our clients and our people and they came with us. So, talent is out
there. I think, our reputation helps and I think our momentum is very good and we don't see anything that will stop
it right now.

Good, good, good. Hey, appreciate all the color on the loan growth and the margin expectations. The question I
want to ask you about now is more about you're hitting $50 billion in assets here very soon. How does that
change your operating strategies? And does that change how you're thinking about regulations and the ability to
continue to acquire?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Not really, because we do the smaller deals, which aren't going to – historically we've done smaller deals which
don't really get the attention of the big guys in DC. When we do – as of now, who knows what will happen if the
new [ph] OC, the councilor comes in and we ought to speak (00:49:27) Russian or something then. But right now,
we have great relationship with the regulators. Our CRA is I mean, almost what, 14 of the 15 banks are
outstanding and the other one is got hopefully really close.
And we always said that the regulators make the rules. They are played by the rules. You can yell at the [ph] ref,
only I can bump the ref (00:49:54). But we'll play [ph] it by ear (00:49:59). But I think, we have a good reputation
with them. And [indiscernible] (00:50:07) just because of how we're structured, we still are small. I mean, we might
be $50 billion in the aggregate, but our average bank is what $3 billion – $2 billion, $3 billion. And the branches
[indiscernible] (00:50:23) have their own. I mean, everybody is an owner here. We're able to really [ph] be close
(00:50:29) to the customer with our decisions. I think that model can keep going for a long time. [indiscernible]
(00:50:36) comments on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I don't think there's anything magical about the $50 billion mark per se. I mean, our infrastructure is such that
we can have considerable growth. And we just continue to build the infrastructure and the team to handle that.
So, I don't see anything significant. You hear in the marketplace that the bigger deals are a little bit slow to get
regulatory approval right now. But as I'd said, we typically have done the smaller tuck-in deals and those seem to
be moving at a quicker pace. So, I don't see anything significant [ph] either (00:51:15).

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we've always been opportunistic about it. It's got to make sense on the pricing side and strategically. We
haven't done it beyond a couple of years because [ph] we have found one that (00:53:14) did that. But we've
always been very, very prudent in how we approach it. So, I said before a thousand times, we're not going to give
up a lot of tangible book value to grow [ph] you have five years with earnings to grow (00:53:28) $0.20 a share,
doesn't make a lot of sense.
We take what the market gives us right now. It's giving us organic growth, pricing on deals, big or small as big
deals are a pain in the neck. Not to say that we wouldn't consider it. But I – if I want to philosophize that, every big
deal we've seen starts with taking care of management before they take care of shareholders and that drives me
absolutely crazy, absolutely nuts and guys who come in and you start with that in the conversation about what
about us? What about our shareholders? [ph] And more management is last, you cut your deal and (00:54:09) live
with it.
[ph] So, it's not that we haven't had (00:54:14). We have every investment bank in the world calling on us about
this deal or that deal or big deals and how big we could be and that's kind of important to us. What's important to
us is continue to grow like we grow, the market gives us right now, this organic growth is awesome. Smaller deal
is still our bread and butter, up to $1 billion is good, but it has to make sense. It has to make sense strategically. It
has to make sense economically. And bigger deal, it would just be all – it just doesn't make a lot of sense right
now for a lot of reasons. But you never know [ph] maybe we have one that does (00:54:53) make sense, but I'll
tell you, it drives me nuts, when management [ph] says a lot about me. And then, oh, yeah, (00:54:59) what about
my shareholders. I hate those conversations and they are turn off right out of the box for me. I agree with you.
The markets given us great growth, why differentiate, deviate from that. And there'll be a time when the
acquisitions become more affordable and make more sense and we'll jump in then.
Dave, you got anything on that?

at the same time. There's a deal that comes up that makes economic and cultural sense, but is uncertain. We're
not going to overpay or do a deal just to do a deal. So, we're enjoying the organic growth now and pipelines are
good and [ph] we want keep marching to that too (00:55:44) for the time being.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Hi, guys. Afternoon. Going back to Terry's question on some of the loan growth drivers in the context of the
M&A disruption that's ongoing. Curious in terms of the commercial real estate [indiscernible] (00:56:11) we saw in

the quarter. Obviously [indiscernible] (00:56:12) things you guys benefit from uptick [ph] and line utilization
(00:56:15). But just curious how much of that growth you're seeing is appropriate on the commercial side of things
is being driven by share gains and curious within that context, what inning we're in terms of Wintrust benefiting
from all the M&A related disruption that's occurred in Chicago within the last few years.

Rich?

Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman & Chief Lending Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would say, we're in pretty early innings at this point. I mean, we, as we talk about a couple of questions
ago, this disruption has really been a pretty recent phenomenon over the last four, five years. So, we think that
the goodwill that got established during pandemic through PPP and we basically told all of our lenders when the
pandemic hit, this is when you really start to differentiate yourself as being a banker that you can count on. And
customers appreciated the fact that we were, out of the box, reaching out, seeing what they needed, doing the
things that make us different.
I had lunch with one of our bankers that we hired from one of our competitors recently, and he said it was the
exact opposite at the bank he was at, that they were curtailing lines and they were bumping rates and doing
things that – in the short-term, we couldn't enhance the overall return. But in the long run, you're just going to
really just anger your customers.
So I think there's a long way to go here. I mean, our market share is still relatively small in Chicago and
Milwaukee relative to the competitors. So, I think there's a real strong opportunity here over the next couple of
years to be able to grow that core business.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's great color, and maybe just changing gears, I had a question, Dave, on mortgage. Curious if you
could kind of remind us in terms of the gain-on-sale margin expansion that we saw this quarter is a little more
pronounced than we saw from some others. So, just curious if you can remind us in terms of the VA ARM, what
that secondary market premium tends to look like in terms of – or at least on a relative basis to the kind of
conventional 30-year product, generally speaking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I'm trying to figure out how to answer that. It's just – you're wondering about the directionality of the gain-on-
sale margins?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. And just unique to Wintrust, obviously, you guys have the VA ARM that contributes somewhere around a
quarter of volumes each quarter. So, just curious in terms of what that gain-on-sale margin benefit from having
that production arm in the fold relative to just the typical 30-year conventional product.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, it's certainly is higher but as far as the blend [ph] of the gain on (00:59:12) sale margin, that's pretty
much been a quarter of our business for the last – over a year. So I don't think it's going to change the
directionality of the overall margin. It may be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter as the purchase business goes
down in the Chicago area, because Veterans First does business all over the country and a lot in the southern
states. But I don't think it would change dramatically.
We actually think as far as our margin goes. It increased a little bit this quarter as secondary marketing gains and
losses were a little bit better this quarter as far as that hedging activity [indiscernible] (00:59:56) and a little bit of
product mix change where Veterans First was 26% of the volume versus 23% last time. So those two factors
helped increase the margin a little bit. Our thoughts for the fourth quarter right now and again, it'll depend on mix
of business and some other secondary marketing volatility that could or may not happen, but we would expect the
gain on sale margins to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.

question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just one big picture question for me at this point and it relates to slide 15 of your deck
that highlights the geographic and loan portfolio diversification and clearly paying dividends with the growth you
guys are putting up. I'm just curious, are there any geographies you are not in that you'd like to be or loan
products or niche lending verticals that would fill out this map further?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we're always looking for new niches. Problem is right now, there is one out there they want a lot of money
for, if you want to buy it and kind of [indiscernible] (01:01:28) like starting from scratch and [ph] doesn't pay in big
dollar and have a big TBD dilution (01:01:32). Rich, you want to comment on the other side?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, we are always looking at opportunities. I think the leasing example is a good
one. We started that three years ago and have built that out, because of exactly what you're talking about. It gives
us a much more geographic spread to the loan portfolio. But if we were to – I think, if we had bought something of
comparable size, we would have paid a substantial premium on it. So we like to be building these things. But right
now, I think, it's not so much about markets that we're not necessarily in, but really trying to expand the markets. I
mean, I think that, certainly, adjacent to the footprint, we would like a bigger presence in Indiana. We'd like to
expand our presence in Wisconsin. And looking around the Midwest, you can kind of see some of the other
markets that I think would really appreciate kind of what we do and how we run our business, because there really
isn't a Wintrust type alternative in some of the meaningful cities around the Midwest.
And then, we're also looking at opportunities we've been able to through following our CRE sponsors to other
markets. We've seen some real good opportunities and we've been able to build the Wintrust brand in some
markets that historically we haven't had – been in and haven't had a presence and we're looking at doesn't make
sense to step out a little bit and maybe open up LPOs or see how that would fair. But it's definitely something that
is – that's why we put this slide in here, it's front and center for us to make sure that why we love Chicago and
Wisconsin. We want to make sure that we're just having good diversification within the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Concentration skill. I always say that [indiscernible] (01:03:26) diversify between product type and geography,
that's a very good thing.

question please.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Hey, Dave, just following up on the mortgage banking, I just wanted to clarify. So we should look for 20%
to 30% origination drop and similar rev drop in Q4, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Now, those applications in October have been very similar to September so far, a little less than July and August.
But just based upon seasonality that's what we're thinking, and I think it's fairly in line with the [ph] MBA (01:04:22)
forecast too, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So that's − you just hit on it. That's more seasonality than any rate move that's already percolated through
your pipeline. That's just what you're expecting for things to kind of fall off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hopefully, it's a little bit better than that, but that's what our expectations are right now. I don't think we generally
are too much different than the overall market on origination trends, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And shifting over to PPP, I apologize if I missed this already. But you've got about $25 million left, I believe.
What's kind of the cadence of that recognition do you think?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's probably from the fee standpoint, maybe another 30% to 40% of that comes in the fourth quarter and then it
tails off from there depending on kind of what we see in terms of customer seeking forgiveness. But, as we talked
about, we think the loans will drop off quite a bit and fees follow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand
the program back to Edward Wehmer for any further remarks.
