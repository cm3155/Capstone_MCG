Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's first quarter financial results.
Starting on slide 4, first quarter net income was $162 million or $2.43 per diluted share. The strong results of the
first quarter continued the earnings momentum we developed throughout 2022. This quarter was the second
highest pre-provision net revenue in our history and would have been the highest, absent the extraordinary
market volatility impacting the net mortgage servicing results. The strong financial results in the first quarter are a
testament to our diverse business model, strong operating geographies, and disciplined approach to risk
management that has long been critical to our ability to sustain success.
Our peer-leading tangible capital ratio, carried with our balance sheet liquidity, have served us well over the last
45 days with the disruption in our sector. The disruptions and almost unprecedented level of rate volatility in the
quarter have demonstrated our ability to both manage critical risk well, while also continuing to post strong
financial results for our shareholders. The first quarter showed sustained revenue in our noninterest income
businesses, continued loan growth and an efficiency ratio below 57%.
While no bank can be totally immune from the macro economy, we believe this is precisely the environment that
positively differentiates our diversified business model, robust risk management framework, and strong financial
performance. Our interest rate, liquidity and credit risk management are strong and we remain focused on
increasing top line revenue in the exceptional growth markets.
We had very strong financial results during the first quarter that we're proud to discuss. But today, we'll break our
prepared comments in two sections. In the first section, we'll focus on many of the key metrics around capital,
liquidity and deposit diversity that have been in the focus for the markets over the last 45 days. In the second
section, we will focus on the core results for the quarter, which was the second best pre-provision net revenue
quarter in BOKF's history. We want to address the issues that are top of mind early so that the good financial
results do not get lost in the noise of the recent market disruptions.
Before Marty walks us through the metrics that are top of mind for you, I'd like to make a few broader comments.
The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were idiosyncratic and do not represent broad weakness
in the banking sector. Banks are better capitalized than at any time in my banking career. Regional banks
specifically pay an important role in our communities and play a broad role in our business and economic activity
that cannot be filled by the largest US banks. At BOK Financial, we take managing interest rate, liquidity and
credit risk seriously, and those in risk management roles rightfully create natural tension with those in risk taking
roles to ensure the proper balance exist. We ended the quarter with a neutral interest rate risk posture, a loan-to-
deposit ratio of less than 70% compared to a pre-pandemic loan-to-deposit mean in the 80% range and high
capital levels.
In fact, as of December 31, our tangible common equity inclusive of tax effective unrealized securities net losses
placed us in the top 17% of publicly traded bank with assets greater than $25 billion. By that measure, we ended
the first quarter with an adjusted ratio of 8.2% versus 7.4% last quarter. While liquidity and rate risk have come to
the forefront, managing credit risk is also a core competency. We are the largest traditional bank that did not
participate in TARP during the financial crisis because of our disciplined approach to credit risk management.
In good times, we have remained disciplined to the same credit fairway that allowed us to meaningfully
outperform the last time there was a credit cycle. We have an internal limit of 185% of Tier 1 capital and reserves
for our commercial real estate exposure that we take seriously. While our asset quality levels, including net
charge-offs, potential problem loans and nonperforming loans remained near historic lows, we are building a

strong combined reserve for credit losses at 1.37%. Our earnings performance is even more impressive
considering our current earnings include meaningful provision expense.
Finally, our diverse business model is unique for a bank our size. While the market focused on net interest
revenue and related margins, our operating revenue is very diverse and is a big reason for both the resiliency of
our earnings and a key driver of growth for the company.
I will now turn the call over to Marty to discuss key aspects of our liquidity and capital before we review the first
quarter results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Recent events have focused the market on a couple of specific metrics within capital and liquidity,
and I will cover our position on each. Within capital, that metric is tangible common equity adjusted to include
unrealized net losses and held to maturity securities. That is in addition to unrealized net losses on available for
sale securities that are already captured in the TCE ratio.
The chart on slide 6 shows our December 2022 adjusted TCE versus that same metric for the top 20 banks in the
US. At 7.4%, BOKF level was higher than 18 of those 20 largest banks, and notably higher than each of the four
largest banks. This level of capital strength, which is easy to see by investors and depositors alike, has made our
recent discussions with clients and prospects relatively easy. That same metric for BOKF as of March 31, 2023
was 8.2%, which will compare favorably to March 31 levels of peers and very large banks.
Our strong TCE levels are the result of our disciplined approach to risk management across the organization, but
in particular within the investment portfolio. We monitor and limit TCE exposure to market rate increases. We
maintain a relatively short duration securities portfolio, which increases flexibility when rates increase.
Slide 7 shows the duration of both our AFS and HTM securities and the low level of extension risk. In 2020 and
2021, we understood that a portion of COVID era deposit growth was not permanent and reflected that back in
the size of our portfolio. The vast majority of our securities are US government agency mortgage backed, and
96% can be pledged to secured borrowing sources, which supports liquidity.
I will note that we actually have $1.8 billion of securities with an unrealized gain in our AFS portfolio, mostly due to
our repositioning of the balance sheet in Q4 of 2022. Moving to liquidity, our loan-to-deposit ratio ended the
quarter at 69.8% which is strong relative to peers and our own history. Standing behind the ratio is a diverse
deposit franchise as demonstrated on slide 8.
Even within our larger industry vertical, the largest single industry concentration is energy at only 7% of total
deposits. Corporate banking represents many industries, all more granular than that. The uninsured deposit
metric has received new attention across the industry and slide 8 shows important context for our level. On the
surface, our uninsured deposits totaled 57% as of March 31. However, an important adjustment needs to be
made to that metric to make it more meaningful.
It is appropriate to adjust for collateralized deposits, since those are effectively no different than insured deposits.
Municipalities, Native American tribes, and certain trust-related deposits are all required to be collateralized.
Relative to our asset size, all three of those are large business segments for us and result in aggregate
collateralized deposit balances of $4.5 billion or 14% of total deposits.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
With that adjustment, our effectively uninsured level is $14.2 billion or 44% of total deposits. The next liquidity
assessment that is commonly being made is to compare available liquidity sources versus that net effectively
uninsured deposit number.
Slide 9 shows our available liquidity from collateralized sources as a subtotal of $23.7 billion and then a grand
total of $27.6 billion, including Fed funds line. Both those figures exceed the effectively uninsured deposit total of
$14.2 billion, which is one more way to conclude that our liquidity position is indeed strong. Three pieces of
context on that slide.
First, the number we show under the Federal Reserve's new BTFP program represents the incremental secured
borrowing capacity we would be able to produce due to the favorable collateral haircuts if we were to move
security collateral from FHLB into the BTFP program. Second, the secured borrowing capacity we show for
unpledged loans reflects the net borrowing capacity we would get after applying collateral haircuts to those
specific loan categories. And third, our wealth management business has $17 billion of customer investments
held in money market mutual funds, which are not on our balance sheet. We believe a large portion of this could
be attracted onto our balance sheet, albeit at a market rate and in some cases with a form of insurance
enhancement.
The net result of the disruptive March events to our deposit portfolio was not significant. Total deposit attrition in
Q1 of 2023 was the same amount as in Q4 of 2022 and generally consistent with our guidance provided in
January. For the subset of customers who inquired about how well prepared BOKF is for the present
circumstances, the discussions were made very easy by the strong message we have to share. When I talk about
our outlook, you will notice that our forward-looking guidance on late 2023 loan-to-deposit ratio has not changed.
Lastly, I will note that our wholesale borrowing activity during the quarter was all business-as-usual activity for us,
no usage of the Federal Reserve, either the new program or otherwise. We have increased usage of FHLB,
although it was still lower than what is historically normal for us.
Now let's move to our performance in the quarter. We delivered solid financial results with earnings per share of
$2.43 and net income of $162 million. Period-end loan growth was $193 million and asset quality remains very
strong and well-positioned for potential headwinds.
Now, I will turn the call over to Marc to talk more about the loan growth and credit trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. Turning to slide 11, period-end loans were $22.8 billion or up 0.9% in the quarter. Total C&I loans
were relatively flat, with mix shifts favoring healthcare and services. Total C&I loans have increased $1.2 billion or
9.2% year-over-year, with growth across all sectors. Commercial real estate loans increased $209 million or 4.5%
linked quarter and have increased $714 million or 17% year-over-year. This effectively returns those balances to
their 2020 level after experiencing significant pay down activity in 2021. The annual increase was primarily driven
from loans secured by multi-family residential properties and industrial facilities.
Unfunded commercial real estate commitments decreased 13% linked quarter. We have an internal limit of 185%
of Tier 1 capital and reserve to total CRE commitment. And we're presently at the upper limit of that range. We do
expect continued growth in outstanding CRE balances as construction loans fund up. As of March 31, CRE
balances represented 21% of total outstanding loan balances, a ratio well below our peer. Healthcare balances
increased by $54 million or 1.4% in the quarter and have grown $458 million or 13% year-over-year, primarily
driven by our senior housing sector. Healthcare sector loans represented 17% of total loans at quarter-end.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Energy balances decreased $27 million or 0.8% linked quarter and have increased $200 million or 6% year-over-
year with period-end balances representing 15% of total period-end loan.
Combined services and general business loans, our core C&I loans relatively flat linked quarter with a year-over-
year growth of $539 million or 8.4%. These combined categories represent 30% of our total loan portfolio.
Unfunded commitments in these categories fell slightly linked quarter with utilization rates up slightly, and
utilization rates continued to run below pre-COVID levels, so we have capacity to generate balanced growth apart
from any new customer acquisition.
Year-over-year, loans have grown $2.1 billion or 10%. Excluding PPP loans, Q1 2023 extends the linked quarter
loan growth to six consecutive quarters. Although, we don't expect loan growth to continue at this pace, we do
believe we have the momentum to drive continued growth in the loan portfolio throughout 2023 consistent with
our guidance, unless the macro economy negatively impacts borrower sentiment.
Turning to slide 12, you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio
and well below historical norms and pre-pandemic levels. Nonperforming assets, excluding those guaranteed by
US government agencies decreased $2.5 million this quarter; nonaccrual loans decreased $1.5 million, and
repossessed assets fell $1.7 million. The level of uncertainty in the economic outlook of our reasonable and
supportable forecast remained high, and key economic factors were less favorable to economic growth across all
scenarios, including WTI oil prices and projected commercial real estate vacancy rates.
Those combined economic factors supported a $16 billion credit loss provision for the quarter. With the ratio of
capital allocated to commercial real estate that's substantially less than our peer and a history of outperformance
during past credit cycle, we believe we are well-positioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the
quarters ahead.
The markets are more focused on the office segment of real estate given the recent trends in workforce
preferences though it remains an open question as to whether that will be sustained as employers continue to
require more time in the physical office. Our maturities are generally ratable over the next three to four years, and
we always have a minimum option if the markets are not conducive to long-term permanent financing. The
average loan-to-value ratios in the office space are sub-65%, along with average cash flow coverage in excess of
1.4 times based on our most recent semi-annual review at the end of 2022.
Net charge-offs were less than $1 million for the first quarter and have averaged 7 basis points over the last 12
months, far below our historic loss range of 30 to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to
continue to be low.
The combined allowance for credit losses was $312 million or 1.37% of outstanding loans at quarter-end. We
have noticed many analysts are not using the combined allowance when evaluating strength of loan loss
reserves. The total combined allowance is available for loss, and industry adoption of the unfunded versus funded
reserves is mixed. Any apples-to-apples comparison should include the combined reserve. We expect to maintain
this ratio or to migrate slightly upwards as we expect loan growth to continue, as well as continued economic
uncertainty due to current market conditions. Both of these conditions support credit provisions going forward.
I'll turn the call now over to Scott.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 14, total fees and commissions were $186 million for the first quarter, down $7.6
million or 3.9% linked quarter. Trading and syndication fees were the primary drivers of the linked quarter decline,
down $8.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively. These are partially offset by a $4.3 million linked-quarter increase
in mortgage banking fees.
The trading fee decline was primarily driven by a $7.4 million reduction in our MBS trading activities, as mortgage
originations remain at historically low levels as our trading volumes for both originations and sales. Market
volatility in response to recent bank failures has also restrained trading activity. Commercial loan syndication fees
decreased $4.7 million linked quarter, largely due to significant activity in energy and CRE during the fourth
quarter.
Fees from our municipal investment banking segment increased $2.1 million linked quarter. The $4.3 million
increase in mortgage banking fees is driven by increased servicing revenue and improved mortgage origination
pipeline volumes coming off the seasonally low fourth quarter. Fiduciary and asset management fees were $50.7
million for the first quarter, a 1.5% linked-quarter increase. Our assets under management or administration were
$102.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion or 2.6% linked quarter with growth across all categories. Our asset mix
of assets under management or administration was relatively unchanged this quarter, with 45% fixed income,
32% equities, 14% cash, and 9% alternatives.
We believe our diversified mix of fee income is the strategic differentiator for us when compared to our peers,
especially during times of economic uncertainty. We consistently rank in the top decile for fee income as a
percent of total net interest revenue and noninterest fee income. That revenue mix has averaged just over 36%
during the last 12 months. That consistently supports a revenue stream that is sustainable through most
economic cycles.
I'll now turn over the call to Marty to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Marty?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Scott. Turning to slide 16. First quarter net interest revenue was $352 million, consistent with the prior
quarter, despite two fewer days in the quarter. As expected, the net interest margin decreased 9 basis points
linked quarter to 3.45% due to modestly higher deposit betas and lower demand deposit levels due to the rate
environment. The average effective rate on an interest-bearing deposit increased 61 basis points this quarter,
bringing our cumulative deposit beta to 39% since the Fed began tightening. Average earning assets increased
$1.5 billion compared to the last quarter. The average available for sale portfolio increased $785 million this
quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during Q4. Average loans increased $500 million,
with growth in both commercial and commercial real estate loans.
Turning to slide 18, we highlight our relatively neutral interest rate risk position. Assuming a gradual increase of
100 basis points over 12 months, net interest revenue would decrease only 0.2% or approximately $2.8 million.
Assuming a gradual decrease of 100 basis points over 12 months, net interest revenue would decrease by
approximately 1.9%. We expect to maintain a position which is neither materially asset or liability sensitive for the
near term.
Turning to slide 19, linked quarter total expenses decreased $12.6 million, $4.3 million from personnel and $8.4
million from other operating expense. The personnel expense decline was driven by a $12.6 million reduction in

cash based compensation, partially offset by $6.1 million seasonal increase in employee benefits, primarily payroll
taxes. And a $2.3 million increase in staffing costs due to annual merit increases.
The linked quarter decrease in other operating expense was primarily driven by reduced professional fees and
accruals for mortgage loss mitigation costs, as well as a contribution to the BOKF charitable foundation made in
the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 20, I'll cover our expectations for 2023. We continue to expect mid to upper single digit annualized
loan growth. Economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain very strong and continue to be supported by
business in-migration from other markets. Strong growth in unfunded commitments during 2022 and current low
levels of line utilization should be an additional tailwind for loan growth. Evolving borrower sentiment, given the
macro economy, could impact our assumption if they pull back expecting a slower economic environment.
We expect to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat in 2023 and to maintain a neutral
interest rate risk position. We have a strong base of core deposits and expect attrition in total deposits to taper off,
moving our loan to deposit ratio slightly higher while still remaining below historical levels.
Currently, we are assuming one additional 25-basis-point increase in May before the Federal Reserve deposits.
We believe the margin will migrate lower throughout 2023 as interest-bearing deposit betas increase and demand
deposit balance attrition runs its course. Net interest income is expected to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.4
billion for 2023. In aggregate, we expect total fees and commissions revenue to approach $750 million for 2023.
We expect expenses to be near or slightly below Q4 2022 levels and the efficiency ratio near 57% or 58%
throughout the remainder of 2023. Our allowance level is slightly above the median of our peers and we expect to
maintain a strong credit reserve. Given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality, we
expect quarterly provision expense similar to that in Q1 of 2023. Changes in the economic outlook will impact our
provision expense. And we expect to continue our quarterly share repurchases.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy for closing commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. As we have demonstrated this quarter, strong risk management and strong financial results are
not mutually exclusive. We expect to do both well. Our talented teams collaborate well to ensure we grow our
company the right way, a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles. While the market is more focused
on capital and liquidity, strong metrics spread, don't lose sight of the strong earnings performance in the first
quarter.
For the last two quarters, I have concluded my prepared remarks by saying that we are in this stage where
investing in strong banks versus trading the sector is expected to matter. Banks with thoughtful growth, a diverse
business mix, meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform. That certainly played out
in the first quarter. We are an organic growth company with a fantastic geographic footprint and believe we are
well-positioned to outperform both in the current environment and in the years to come.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

You may have touched on some of this and answered it, but just can you talk about deposit flows, kind of, pre
mid-March and post mid-March if they changed at all for you, guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon. This is Marty. Yeah, we really did not see much of a change at all. If you look pre-post, I mean it's hard
to really discern difference in the trend there. We were able to get talking points out to our customer base really
the same day and further information the following day. And the message was compelling. And so, you saw
certainly a little bit of in and a little bit of out, but it was really no discernible impact for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough. And you use the term deposit attrition running its course, Marty, and help us understand that.
Where do these balances eventually go and how long does it take to run its course?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. I think you'll see the demand deposit attrition kind of run its course. And so, demand deposit, really, that's a
shift between the demand and the interest-bearing. And so, you'll see that kind of run its course over the next
couple of quarters, I think. But in terms of total deposits, our expectation is that that levels off here in Q2, and we
kind of land at a loan-to-deposit ratio in the low 70s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then one for you, Marc. What's the message on the commitment numbers you're giving us, and
what are you seeing in your loan pipeline in terms of what is growing and what's maybe contracting or slowing?

Well, we're actively out meeting with customers, meeting with prospects. We are trying to generate additional loan
business. We're open. We have good, strong credit quality in place. And our credit culture is one that we tend to –
we tend to be consistent. We try not to loosen standards or tighten the standards but to evaluate each deal on an
ongoing basis. And the economies in our markets have been pretty strong.
And so, what we are seeing is we're still seeing some growth in pipeline. We see opportunities that are existing,
and we're comfortable with that. That is consistent with the type of guidance we're getting around loan growth. We
have slowed our additions of commercial real estate commitments because we are close to our upper limit from in
terms of capital. But we expect outstandings to grow as our construction loans fund up.
The rest of our verticals and lines of business, general C&I are still progressing forward. Energy continues to be
pretty strong and the outlook is good in that market. And like I said, our C&I, we're going to be selective, but we're
also going to continue to identify opportunities.

Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
...we're making with our teams is that, these are the types of environments where we can be most differentiated.
Because our strong capital and liquidity level, we don't have to be inwardly focused and kind of concentrate on
things that are more optically driven, that allows us to continue to be externally focused and continue to focus on
customer acquisition and new business development. And I think the ability to be externally focused at a time like
this, I think, is to our long term best interest. And I think part of our history has been this is when we generally can
differentiate our self the most in the marketplace.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So the share buyback has been relatively consistent over time. But you repurchase stock at about $100 a share in
the first quarter. The stock's now at $80. So about one-fourth of tangible book value. So the valuation of your
stock is more compelling. Do you think about increasing the size of the buyback, just given where the stock is
trading going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, we see that the same way and so we are enthusiastic about our share buyback opportunity here in
the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Disappointed to get the opportunity, but we see it the same way you do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, then maybe just quickly, I mean, two of your lending segments that are pretty notable, your
healthcare is 17% loans, energy is 15% of loans. So those two combined are about a third of your loan portfolio.
Maybe just a quick update on what you're seeing credit quality wise in both of those segments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I'll take – this is Marc. I'll take energy first. I mean, energy credit quality is about as good as it could possibly
be. With oil prices, even with gas prices where they are, we have strong borrowing base supported customers.
The other thing that we have is very strong hedging activity in our energy portfolio. So, most of our gas weighted
customers are hedged through 2024 at $3.5 versus the spot rate. And if you look, you can hedge out gas today
almost $4.20 out into 2025.
So the ability to look forward for a gas producer is in good shape and oil continues to be a very flat curve. It's
down a little bit. But it's the – overall, it's in good shape. So we expect to continue no credit issues in that portfolio
for the foreseeable future. The healthcare side continues to be a good portfolio for us. The only material issues in
that industry seem to be around Medicare, Medicaid reimbursements, which are just taking time to catch up. But
we're seeing some of the issues around staffing ease a little bit and we see growth in that an opportunity in the
senior housing segment, which is the primary part of our healthcare portfolio. And no material issues systemic on
any credit quality issues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Brady. This is Stacy. I think on the healthcare side, I think the market has made the mistake a little bit of looking at
the performance of some of these healthcare REITs and things like that and trying to look through to the banks

and see how that could impact the banks. And I just think that that permanent financing market is so different than
the bank finance market, customer selection is so critical, and the portfolio for us has performed so well over such
a long period of time that we don't have any near-term concerns at all. And over the long term, it's probably been
our single best performing asset quality segment that we have on our books today, at least over the last 20 years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then finally for me, either TLAC becomes partially effective for the banks beginning
next year, the bank's over $50 billion. I know you guys right now are a little under $50 billion, but as you possibly
grow over $50 billion, you begin to become subject to TLAC. Will that be any impact? Would you have to raise
any debt or any liquidity sources to become TLAC compliant?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, this is Marty. I'd say that the jury's still out on exactly which portions of that systemic and systemically
important bank set of regulations will flow down from the $700 billion into the $250 billion to the $100 to the $50
billion, that the jury's still out on that. And I'd even say the TLACs probably the less the least likely component of
that to hit $50 billion. And I think AOCI is actually more likely to affect the $50 billion to $100 billion crowd. And for
us, because of the way we're already managing our common equity, that AOCI impact would be pretty negligible
for us.
So, we're not looking at that regulatory waterfall as something that would be really problematic for us at this point.
But we'll learn more about that over the next, well, a little bit more in May and then a lot more over the next year,
how that's really going to play out.

Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're right at 39%. And we do think that that comes higher through the rest of the year. We're actually
reflecting a number that's basically around 50% for the – at the end of the year in our assumption set. So, we've
already got that baked in. And that covers both the next rate hike in May and then some amount of trickle up after
that, just would naturally occur in the portfolio.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Just again circling back on deposits, appreciate the
commentary about the expected continued attrition, albeit at a slower pace. Looking specifically at demand
deposits, we're starting to approach the pre-pandemic level. I'm just wondering just the magnitude of rate hikes.
Can we see that actually going below that 34% pre-pandemic level or is there good visibility that that's a good
floor for demand deposits here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
I actually do think that it'll come a little bit below that. Because you've got just a higher ultimate rate level than we
saw pre-pandemic. And so just because of that, I think our central case here in our – internally, we're thinking that
that does go somewhat below the 34%, but it remains in the low-30s. That's our base case expectation there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And all of these assumptions that we've talked about are really reflected in the net interest revenue guidance that
we've provided this quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And for the deposit outflows that we have been seeing, how much of that is going to that money market
account and the mutual funds and the ability to bring those back online? Would there be any reason to kind of

proactively bring those back online? Or are you comfortable that much of those funds will kind of matriculate back
to the balance sheet once the rate environment starts turning in the other direction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. So I'll start and Scott may add to this. But we have seen a decent percentage of that attrition off the balance
sheet go on balance sheet in our own broker-dealer within the various market-based alternatives that we offer
there. And so, that's really just been a function of price. And so, that's something that can be relatively easily
stopped or reversed as we make sure that our price point and our attention to that particular side of the business
is focused on retaining that and bringing it back on balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So this is Scott. The thing I would add on that, just specific to the balances that have migrated to various
areas inside of our wealth management organization, it's really comprised of not just institutional money market
funds, but we've seen significantly high levels of activity in treasuries, specifically short term T-bills. And we're
starting to see the maturity of that big move of liquid dollars that went on in late in the fourth quarter of last year
and throughout the first quarter of this year. So we have a significant multibillion – a few billion dollars of Treasury
volumes that have migrated from our balance sheet. And then also – and those are handled by us in – within the
broker dealer and then significant balances totaling $17 billion in institutional and other types, varieties of money
market funds.
So to the point that Marty made when we have hit a price point and can price those at a level that we want and
need those balances, we feel confident that we can bring values and amounts back that we're interested in putting
back on the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
But to your point earlier, the vast preponderance of the liquidity that's left the balance sheet has flowed through
our wealth and broker dealer platform that we manage and that we help our customers manage. And so that's
what makes that easier in the event that at the right price point, we can bring it back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. That's good color. And then just one last one for me, looking at the unfunded commitments, I guess, how
much of that is formulaic and what starts to fund up this year? Are you starting to see some of these construction
deals push back just given some of the broader macro uncertainty? And I guess on the other side of that, what is
your appetite right now to be legging in to the funding of some of these construction deals in this environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. I mean, we've made a commitment where we're going to fund on the commitments that we make
regardless of what the environment is. Our outstanding growth really, if you look over the last several years, has
really been focused in multifamily and industrial. Those are two segments that are still performing very well and
are anticipated to continue to perform well. We've underweighted retail and office. You see that in the lack of
growth in those segments and, in fact, those areas have declined over the last several periods as well.

So I don't – clearly, there's concern about that. At the end of the day, we've got 21% of our total loans in
commercial real estate. So the fact that we have institutionally really underweighted that segment relative to other
regional banks, we think will help us in addition to the fact that we think we've done a good job with our
underwriting and customer selection as well. But I think, ultimately, having diversity in our lending portfolio will
prove to be very valuable to us over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And are you seeing any clients kind of push back that funding schedule, or is it pretty much in alignment

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So this is Scott. So when we – when you look at the trend, second half of last year, as you know, we were
in the midst of consistent rate increases. There's no question that we saw uncertainty and some volatility, some

widening of spreads in the fixed income markets. And so, our desks have done a good job of managing our risk
positions and still staying active in the space and serving our customers with liquidity.
And we feel like, as we built into the first quarter of this year, we had begun kind of back on a more consistent and
sustainable growth trend in our balances and our activities in the mortgage back space. The second half of
March, obviously saw some disruption and dislocation to the market, but we've seen steady results out of that
activity.
We've seen an increase in flows and revenues associated with municipal bond activity, which have actually now
supplanted our mortgage backed securities revenues in some aspects of that revenue generation. So we feel like
we're going to see as mortgage rates become acclimated, the mortgage borrowers acclimate the current rate
environment, we're not facing a steady stream of rate increases. We'll see those flows migrate up and that activity
and volume levels will normalize. So we're optimistic about the activity in that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And just a reminder, and this is Stacy, that segment is very volatile. But if you look at total fees and commissions
and we've got those broken out on slide 14 of the presentation, over a period of time, it's a very stable source of
earnings. So, any individual category can move around a bit from quarter-to-quarter. But the total category is very
stable. And in fact, we haven't changed our guidance for this section for the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Because as Stacy mentioned that if you look at the actual total revenues for our broker-dealer aggregated, we're
up slightly in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But the – and that takes into account the fact we're earning
higher revenue streams on money market funds and other sources as balances have migrated.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
I just wanted to ask – it was a very good presentation. Just with this strong balance sheet and credit trends, are
you seeing opportunities to take market share in your markets? And secondly, are you seeing some of the
competitors pull back with what's going on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think in the first, I think, it's probably a little bit too early to say definitively that we're seeing opportunities
to take market share. But certainly anecdotally, we're hearing opportunities within the market, both in terms of
talent and customer opportunities. We can grow both ways, adding talented team members to our core here, as
well as adding customers and prospects as well. And so, I think we see both of those. It's a little early to be
definitive about that, but clearly, that's the case anecdotally. As we look forward and kind of see the environment,
it really will depend on how long the market's perception of the weakness in the sector continues. I think as long
as it persist, I think our strength will continue to allow us to create some disproportionate opportunities that we're
working very hard to take advantage of even as we speak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then, Martin, I had a question about the net interest income outlook. The assumption is that the Fed
pauses on rates. But if we look at the forward curve, it does assume two or three rate cuts. And if we get that, is
there pressure on the net interest income range to come in below the low end of that range if we get the rate
cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Peter, were relatively balanced on our rate risk position. And so, the guidance ranges we gave, even if we
saw that, I think we'd still expect to be within that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we don't – our internal forecast doesn't assume the rate cuts, but we have on slide 18 define for the market
what would happen in a down 100 ramp. So you can see the impact that we forecast the net interest revenue
should that scenario play out over time. It's not significant on a quarterly or annual basis at all. Recall that that we
moved back in the fourth quarter to position ourselves to be more rate neutral.
You've followed us for a long time and know that we traditionally have been rate neutral in terms of how we
manage interest rate risk. We did lean in asset sensitive to benefit from rising rates, but in the fall, our views
began to shift that the risk were more balanced between up and down, and so took action early to mitigate any
interest rate risk. And so we're really positioned to be much more neutral today and really back to the position
we've been historically over most of my career here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
All right. Thanks, Stacy. Nice quarter in a tough environment.

So could you help us quantify the level of deposit attrition you're expecting this year and kind of give us a sense of
the trajectory of the tapering and kind of when you expect deposit balances to stabilize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brandon, our outlook there is that you'll see tapering of the total deposit balances here in Q2 and then we
kind of end up with a low-70s loan to deposit ratio. And sure, there's hard to put a pin in exactly the decimal point
there. But I think that gives you a pretty good outlook for how we see the rest of the year playing out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And a follow-up on your comments on brokers and trading, is it fair to assume that the inventory of trading
securities should kind of rise incrementally throughout the year just given those trends?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think that a lot of that depends on mortgage originations. It depends on flows as a whole and then downstream
customer appetite for mortgage-backed securities. But we would expect that as we normalize in the rate outlook
and the Fed clarity sets in, we would expect to grow those balances and those levels back to more historic levels.
