Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. And I fully appreciate we're competing
with a historic day here, so particularly appreciate you listening in. We will be brisk as we always try to be.
Morgan Stanley delivered record results in 2020. We generated an ROTCE of 15.4%, while meaningfully driving
our strategic vision forward. We successfully closed our acquisition of E*TRADE, received an upgrade from
Moody's to A2, were placed on review for upgrade a second time and announced our intent to acquire Eaton
Vance. Then last month, following the Federal Reserve's release of its second stress test results, we announced
a $10 billion buyback program that we intend to execute in 2021. Our performance and competitive position serve
as hard evidence that Morgan Stanley has reached an inflection point.
Jon will discuss the details of this year's performance in a moment, but first let me walk you through our vision for
the next decade and our focus on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update. This is something we've now
done since I believe 2012.
Let's turn to slide 3. Our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress and delivering
strong results when markets are active. 2020 for sure tested this thesis. In a rapidly evolving operating
environment, we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client
needs. We delivered record revenues of $48 billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management. Those
revenues, by the way, are up from $34 billion in the time period 2010 through 2014.
Turn to slide number 4. We enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth for several strategic acquisitions.
In 2019, as you know, we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of Solium. And in 2020 we took a
leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. Combining with E*TRADE
positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable, economic way. E*TRADE's
technology, products and innovation mindset enhance our growth model. Further, E*TRADE serves the younger
demographic who are on average over 10 years younger than those we've historically served; and we can
continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex.
With Eaton Vance we will create a leading asset manager of scale. Eaton Vance brings new investment
capabilities to our platform and leading positions in secular growth areas, particularly customization and
sustainability. The deal will also expand our client reach, combining MSIM's robust international distribution with
Eaton Vance's strong U.S. distribution.
Please turn to slide number 5. Having experienced periods of fragility, healing and stability, our firm is now at an
inflection point. The next decade will be characterized by growth. Our growth drivers span across all three of our
business segments. We'll focus on gaining market share, expanding and deepening our client relationships,
realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage, and finally, returning capital to our shareholders.
Please turn to slide 6. Scale and our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver,
gaining market share. Our integrated investment bank produced $26 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis. Our
Wealth and Asset Management platform is among the largest globally with over $5 trillion in combined assets.
Our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client
wallet, as you can see on slide 7. Our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage and are
capturing asset and revenue growth. In 2020 international securities generated over $300 million of revenues
from transactions through Wealth Management referrals. Wealth Management in turn gained $20 billion of client
assets and Investment Management saw $6 billion of net flows and commitments, all from Institutional Securities
referrals.

Our second growth driver, expanding and deepening our client base, begins with Institutional Securities on slide
8. Our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and client-focused approach. We built revenues
meaningfully to a record $26 billion in 2020. The result of this growth, coupled with risk and expense discipline,
was an operating margin of 35%.
Turn to slide 9 which talks about our Wealth Management business. With the acquisition of E*TRADE, we are
now a top three player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances and each presents
unique growth opportunities. With our increased capabilities, we can deepen client relationships and provide more
services to millions of households.
If we look at E*TRADE on slide 10, you'll see the business had a remarkable year in 2020, setting new records
across all material metrics. The unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully
increased levels of engagement. Versus prior records, trading activity more than tripled and net new assets more
than doubled. Deposits reached record levels. Extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional
evidence that our decision to buy E*TRADE was indeed the right one.
On slide 11 we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets, bringing over $200 billion of assets
this year new to our firm, that's 6% of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis. We've invested heavily over
the years, building our modern wealth strategy, enhancing our technology and building new businesses, and the
addition of E*TRADE will only help. This year's net new asset growth was remarkable and while net new assets
tend to fluctuate obviously in any year, and this was likely the high end of what is the likely range, we still expect
net new assets to remain well above historic levels.
On slide 12, every year for the past decade our revenues have increased, and with E*TRADE our daily revenues
will be significantly higher in the future. In 2020, 65% of trading days saw revenues in excess of $70 million. That
was compared to just 2% only four years ago.
Let's talk about Investment Management on slide 13. With our announcement to acquire Eaton Vance, we will
create a premier global asset manager with $1.4 trillion in assets under management. Since 2017, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management has grown assets under management by over $360 billion, and both MSIM and
Eaton Vance have each individually attracted industry-leading long-term net flows over 20%. We are really
excited about this transaction and the integration planning is going well.
Eaton Vance's businesses remain strong with increasing assets under management through the end of
December. We expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter.
Slide 14 shows the power of our Wealth and Investment Management platforms when taken together. On a pro
forma basis, we will have over $5 trillion in client assets, creating further revenue opportunities. Our efforts to
enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth. Pro forma client assets are more than double
the amount we oversaw in 2014. Consistent with our predominantly advice-driven business model, revenue on
these assets, expressed in basis points on the right-hand side of the page, is materially higher than our three
larger competitors.
Now, let's turn to slide 15, which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize. The cost
synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track. And on the funding side, with the additional liquidity in
deposits we've added since the announcement, we expect $100 million more in synergies than originally
4

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
projected. We also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals, and
they're outlined in a little bit of detail down the right-hand side of this slide.
So turning to 16; expense discipline is a fundamental tenet of the way we manage Morgan Stanley and has
enhanced record pre-tax profits. And you see our efficiency ratio has come down from 2014 at 79% to just under
70% this past year, and obviously that has driven the pre-tax profit expansion.
So our fifth growth driver is highlighted on page 17. Over the past several years, we have consistently improved
our returns despite holding material excess capital. We're excited about the opportunity to return that excess to
shareholders and announced a $10 billion buyback program for this year. We restarted our share repurchase
program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve.
I'll now conclude with our updated strategic objectives which are shown on slide 18. While this year will be a
transition year as we absorb two major acquisitions, our focus remains on positioning Morgan Stanley to achieve
our long-term strategic targets. Our long-term aspiration and, frankly, our belief is that Wealth Management will
generate a margin over 30% by 2022. And in that period, we expect to range from 26% to 30% as we continue to
work through the E*TRADE integration.
We also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth, but will balance this with discipline. In so
doing, we're keeping our long-term efficiency ratio below 70% and within the range 69% to 72% over the next two
years.
Finally, our long-term aspiration for ROTCE is indeed to exceed 17%. How quickly that occurs depends not only
on our business performance, but also, of course, on capital distribution. In the meantime, we raised our two-year
target to the range of 14% to 16%. As always, these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook
and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment. However, based on what we see now, we fully
expect to achieve these as stated.
That concludes the strategic part of the conversation. I'll now turn the call over to Jon who is going to go through
the fourth quarter and annual results, and then together we look forward to taking your questions. Thank you.

Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $48 billion in 2020, records both with and without
E*TRADE. We saw continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of $13.6 billion. Dynamic markets,
incredible volatility and consistent client engagement across all three businesses drove results.
Excluding E*TRADE integration-related expenses, our ROTCE was 18.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarter and
full year respectively, and EPS was $1.92 and $6.58 respectively. We continued to deliver on operating leverage
in 2020, led by Institutional Securities.
Non-compensation expenses for the year increased 15% driven by increased volume-related expenses and
higher credit provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business
development. Compensation expenses increased 11% on a full year basis on higher revenues. Revenues for the
full year were up 16%, resulting in efficiency ratio of 70%, down from 73% in 2019.
Now to the businesses, in Institutional Securities, our business achieved various records throughout the full year.
Our revenues were $26 billion, 25% higher than our previous best year. While all regions contributed to the
5

results, growth in Asia was a standout. Revenues were $7 billion in the quarter, marking the strongest fourth
quarter in more than 10 years. The traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced, and clients remained
active up until the week of Christmas.
Investment banking revenues were $7.2 billion for the full year, 26% higher than 2019, driven by record
underwriting revenues, particularly equity. In response to the COVID environment, the year saw a rolling opening
of markets beginning with debt and rescue financing, next with equity and very recently leveraged loans and
corporate M&A financing. Quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade generating revenues of $2.3
billion, 46% higher versus the prior year, driven by record underwriting and advisory results with each region
contributing revenues well above average run rates.
Overall, the investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products. The pace of M&A
announcements has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active. Equity issuance remains robust
with a strong backlog from IPOs driven by leadership in health care and technology and follow-on activity, notably
in the Americas and Asia. After a record-breaking year in investment grade and high yield debt markets, strategic
activity should support increased acquisition-related financing.
In equity sales and trading, we remain number one globally for the seventh consecutive year. Full year revenues
of $9.8 billion increased 22% from the prior period. This represents the strongest annual result in over a decade.
This year's market backdrop was unprecedented and the strong performance across products reflected
heightened client activity amidst elevated volatility and a double-digit increase in global market volume.
Fourth quarter revenues of $2.5 billion and full year results were robust across products and regions with the
biggest growth drivers from derivatives and Asia. Fixed income sales and trading revenues were the highest in
over a decade, increasing 59% to $8.8 billion for the year. Clients were highly engaged in a year marked by
higher volumes and volatility, active capital markets and wider bid/ask spreads.
Fourth quarter revenues of $1.7 billion increased 31% year-over-year. Results in the quarter and full year were
led by credit and foreign exchange. For the full year, Asia showed particular strength. Across other sales and
trading and other revenues, results this quarter improved versus the prior year. The increase primarily reflected
lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plans.
Our ISG credit portfolio continues to perform well. Over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are investment
grade or secured. ISG loans and lending commitments are up $9 billion this quarter as we continue to support our
clients, while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline and is now close to pre-pandemic
levels. After building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first three quarters, it was essentially flat in Q4.
ISG provisions were $14 million, while net charge-offs were approximately $40 million, primarily related to one
commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel.
While risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio, the portfolio continues to decline. We de-risked
this portfolio by close to $2 billion this quarter and it now represents less than 10% of our portfolio. Over 90% of
this portfolio, like our entire ISG portfolio, is either investment grade or secured. Our reserve coverage remains
stable and forbearance for the ISG portfolio continues to decline.
Turning to Wealth Management, on October 2 we closed our acquisition of E*TRADE. This quarter's results
include the combined business financials with virtually all of the E*TRADE revenues in transactional and NII.
Making comparisons to prior periods are difficult so I will focus my comments on Q4 and how we are positioned
6

for 2021. We have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on page 7 regarding the combined
business.
In the quarter, revenues were $5.7 billion. Excluding integration-related expenses of $231 million, the PBT margin
was 22.9% and full year margin was 24.2%. The underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong,
reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity. We saw record fee-based flows
of $77 billion for the year and fee-based assets are now $1.5 trillion. We added $18 billion of loans or 22% growth
in 2020 and loans are nearly $100 billion.
Asset quality continues to be excellent and loans in forbearance are under $400 million, down from approximately
$2 billion at the end of Q1. Deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by $54 billion from E*TRADE and
are at $306 billion. The network generated net new assets of $66 billion in the quarter, and on a pro forma basis
over $200 billion in the year. We remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and
retain our productive advisors. These underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for
the future.
In the quarter, Asset Management fees were $3 billion, benefiting from higher asset levels and $24 billion of fee-
based flows. Transaction volumes remained elevated and revenues were strong, even after excluding
approximately $350 million of DCP as clients were active across both advisor-led and self-directed channels.
Net interest income was $1.2 billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment
portfolio that came with E*TRADE. This is a reasonable exit rate to inform 2021 and includes some purchase
accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization, which is approximately $50 million a quarter. This
year NII will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates.
On funding synergies, we on-boarded approximately $4 billion of deposits that were previously swept off
E*TRADE's balance sheet in the back half of Q4 and we expect to on-board approximately $20 billion in Q1. As
we invest these deposits and shed higher cost wholesale funding, we would expect to realize 80% of our revised
higher funding benefits and NII in 2021 with the full impact of these actions reflected in Q2.
On lending we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately 10% loan growth to benefit NII.
Lastly on rates, we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near term. However, we will benefit from the
eventual normalization of rates. The acquisition of E*TRADE increases our U.S. bank sensitivity to rates and a
100 basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated $1.5 billion of additional NII compared to the
estimated $1 billion we disclosed in our Q prior to completing the acquisition.
We continue to expect $800 million of integration costs over three years with approximately 40% to be realized
this year. Following the close of the transaction, we took actions to realize the $400 million of cost synergies we
outlined. Our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and
will be measured. In 2021 we will be exiting the E*TRADE branches, consolidating our bank entities and
integrating HR and finance systems. And we would expect to realize approximately 25% of the cost synergies
during the year.
Investment Management reported revenues of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, representing the second highest
quarterly level in over a decade. For the full year, revenues were $3.7 billion, in line with the prior period, but
reflecting a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Total AUM rose to a record high of $781 billion of which long-term AUM was also a record at $493 billion. Long-
term net flows were $8.5 billion in the quarter. Our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance
and attract positive flows. Total net flows were $25 billion.
The global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record long-term net
flows of $41 billion for the year, and an annual long-term growth rate of 12%.
We are excited about the transaction with Eaton Vance. Across businesses and strategies, Eaton Vance's assets
under management increased by over $65 billion since October. The overall tone of the business is strong and
their momentum continues.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets were $1.1 trillion and standardized RWAs increased to $454
billion, reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of E*TRADE. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to
the prior quarter at 17.4%.
Our tax rates were 23% and 22.5% for the quarter and full year respectively. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in
and around 23%, which will exhibit some quarter-to-quarter volatility.
We are pleased with our strong performance this year. Our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have
been in well over a decade. We enter 2021 with strong asset levels, healthy pipelines, engaged institutional and
retail clients and an extremely strong brand. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives.
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Brendan Hawken with UBS. Your
line is now open.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start on the net new asset disclosure that you
guys provided here this quarter for the first time. Thanks for that. It's very, very helpful. It seems as though the net
new asset growth, the organic growth profile and the Wealth business accelerated here in 2020. What do you
think is driving that? Is that, A, capturing a greater wallet share of existing clients? Is that the expansion of the
client base? And it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions. Do you have an estimate of what
that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate? Because I believe most of the other competitors disclose it
net of those fees. So just want to try and make it like for like. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, let me start and Jon will talk about some of the disclosure stuff. And as you point out, Brennan, it's the first
time I think we've done it in many, many years and we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business
has unbelievable growth. I mean, we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with, frankly, in
absolute dollars, modest assets, and we were able to bring in $200 billion in a year.

Now, part of that is obviously it's pro forma basis. Part of that is if you look at what E*TRADE is doing, they're
doing great. Part of it is if you're a net attrition of financial advisor, you will be a net attrition of assets on those
advisors' books. For the first time in 20-plus years I've been doing this we're not in net attrition which is interesting
given the IFA channels continue to grow but they're not growing from us. So we're keeping assets of our advisors,
we're gaining assets from new advisors. Through the workplace initiatives, through Solium and E*TRADE, we're
gaining assets from the conversion and keeping those assets at a higher rate than we were. So it's a whole
variety of things that have been done within the Wealth Management business to look for ways to continue to
accelerate our client asset growth at the firm and it's not a single thing.
I do think 6%, that's, as I've used the expression before, it's a sporty number but it's a long way from the 2% or
the 3%, 4% we were operating at. And I think it will be elevated. I don't think we're going to go back to 2% but
maybe 6%, that feels high. Certainly best in class to what the Street offers. But maybe Jon has more on the
disclosures.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, so the two critical exposures, the net new assets and then the fee-based flows, and you can see from the
footnotes on the net new assets which is a concept of the assets that we bring into the organization net of the
outflows, that does not exclude the fees. You can figure, see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure,
about $10 billion or $11 billion. The fee-based flows do exclude that as a function about how much fee-based
assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset base. Hopefully that clarifies the question.
I think for us, the net new assets given the different business models across the different business models, it
reflects most people don't have the level of asset-based fees that we do, and we thought it was appropriate to
disclose that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, no, that's great. That's very helpful clarification and agree, the growth rate looks robust. I mean, you
regularly hear about how the traditional Wealth Management firms are just the providers of share and certainly a
mid-single digit growth rate does not suggest you're providing or ceding share to anybody. So, agreed there.
And then for my follow-up sort of a related question. One of the things that a lot of people and myself included
think is one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the Wealth business is the Stock Plan business where
you really just have such a strong position competitively. And you flag a lot of that in the deck, which is really
helpful. You talk about the retention opportunity, the 15%-plus which is what E*TRADE has pointed to historically.
What's the plan to integrate the Stock Plan platforms? How long do you think that might take? And is it right –
when we think about the opportunity set, you've got the $435 billion of unvested assets. My guess is that's the
opportunity set. About how much of that tends to vest per year? Is it about a quarter or 30%? And it's right to think
about that as evergreen, right? Like invest and then they're replaced with new awards in subsequent year. Sorry
about the multipart question but I think it's important. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
That's okay. So we have integrated the sales team. We're going to market to our corporate clients with a
consolidated sales effort. As you would expect, we're going to be very mindful of the integration of these
platforms. I would highlight that there was certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies, small
9


Morgan Stanley

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
companies, private companies, and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of
bring the best of both of those platforms together.
You're right; the existing opportunity is the $435 billion of unvested assets and roughly 5 million participants. Our
expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have and, therefore, the number
of participants, and we've seen good closure rates since announcing both the Solium transaction and the
E*TRADE transaction, so we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships
we have in that channel.
And then, lastly, on the $435 billion, give or take 25% or 30% of that vests each year. I think that's a pre-tax
number. So, clearly, there's tax impacting that, but as you say, our expectation is that number will continue to
grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, you clearly gained share this quarter, the year in capital markets and trading. Aside from your gaining
share, what is your outlook for the industry wallet? As you know, it shrunk in trading for a decade and now it may
or may not have turned more permanently. So, some banks say we're planning for 2019 levels for trading. Some
think it can maintain this pace. Some say it's in between. Kind of where do you fall out and why? What do you see
as the structural changes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Mike, it's very difficult to say. I mean, just look at what we've been through in the last 12 months and look at
activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter and then where the year finished. So, clearly, there is a lot of
activity in the market. There is enormous fiscal stimulus. Rates remain very low. I think the global economies are
recovering. And I think the vaccine, if we get in the US to 1 million doses a day for the next 150 days, would be
spectacular. So there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance, new IPOs coming,
recapitalizations of different kinds, raising debt. So there's a lot of market activity, I think, in the reasonable near
term.
Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean, you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds. Less than 50%, I think.
But who knows? The year has started off strong and we count them one day at a time. And the year's started off
strong, the markets are active. The economies are recovering globally. The new administration has come in. It
looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today. So I'm quite optimistic about it.
I can't put a pin to say exactly where we're going to end up, but we're clearly gaining share. Our fixed income
franchise has well recovered from the 2015 restructuring and 2012 lows. Our equities bounced and retained their
number one spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool. And clearly, with the banking revenues above
$2 billion for the quarter, there's a lot of M&A activity and a lot of underwriting activity. So I'm pretty optimistic. I

here.

Generally, I think from my comments, Mike, we describe them as healthy across all products and all regions with
IPOs as a standout. As I said, M&A activity, dialogue is very active, pipeline very healthy. So, as James said, a
very constructive start to the year with very healthy pipeline.

Thank you, and good morning, James and Jon. Maybe back on Wealth Management, organic growth, and again,
echo the earlier comments. Really appreciate the new information. But, James, you seem to be really playing
down the 6% this year as not sustainable. So I guess can you just maybe help us understand what exactly was
elevated in 2020? Was it just overall industry was elevated? Was there something more specific to Morgan
Stanley like higher recruiting? I'm just trying to understand why you think it was elevated.
And then maybe, more importantly, just looking forward, give us a sense of what you think the business can do
sustainably, a sort of range for organic growth that you would expect for the business. Thank you.

Christian, you probably know me well enough by now to know I'm not going to project a trend line based upon one
point of data. Listen, we've had a decade of been growing net new assets around $2 trillion and 3%, 4%. Clearly,
E*TRADE has a fast-growing asset growth capability that adds enormously. I think net positive financial advisor,
our actual numbers of financial advisors went up this quarter, I think, for the first time for years. So, I just trend to
the conservative until I see more data.
And do I think it's going to fall back to 2%? Not at all. But if we could lock in 6% for the next 10 years, and we'll be
bringing – we're bringing in $200 billion a year. I read about a lot of these online players who've got $20 billion in
total and we bring in $20 billion every five weeks. So we're effectively creating these companies every five weeks.
Now, if it's going to be 4.5%, 5.5%, I don't know. My instinct is 6% on $4 trillion is a lot of assets to bring in and I
think it's doable. I'm not saying it's not doable. But I'm not predicting that, and I wouldn't want to guide to you that.
On the other hand, I don't think we're going back to where – I think we've got a different kind of company. The
reason the title of this presentation is called Morgan Stanley at an Inflection Point: The Next Decade of Growth is

if there's one message I would like people to take away from it is we're in the growth phase of this company for
the next decade. We've been in – as we said, from the crisis forward, sort of fragility, then healing, then stability
and we are unambiguously in a growth phase. We have the capital to invest in our businesses, we're gaining
share across our businesses. We've got scale in the key businesses. We've invested in a lot of technology
improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency. And I believe we're in a growth phase in this
company and one of those indicators of growth will be very strong net new asset growth.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Fair enough. Maybe switching over to capital. With the stock now trading well above book value, how are you
thinking about prioritizing buybacks versus dividends? I think in the past you have spoken to an aspirational target
of paying out all of Wealth and Asset Management earnings as a dividend, so maybe just some updated thoughts
around how you're thinking about that prospect? And again, buyback versus dividend conversation here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, the third leg to that conversation, a very important leg, is investing in the business. If we're going to grow –
let's pretend we're growing, I don't know, net earnings of $10 billion and we're paying out dividends at the moment
of about $2.5 billion. So if we were doing a buyback this year of $10 billion, we're only eating into our buffer $2.5
billion a year. We're not going to chip away at it much. We're at 78.4% and I think our threshold is 13.2%. I'm
looking at Jon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
13.2%. Let's assume we carry, what, a 50, 100 basis point buffer on our SCBs. So let's assume we want to run at
14.2%. We're at 17.4%. We've clearly got some room to move. Obviously, we've got the Eaton Vance move
coming in which affects those numbers about 100 basis points. So, as I think about it, I've described this before,
half our company has that sort of yield component to it, very stable revenues and earnings and we could clearly
move the dividend higher and will once the regulators permit that. We have – clearly, we have the capacity.
On the book value, yes, I would actually prefer to be buying stock last year when we were at $27. Unfortunately,
we couldn't do that. But I'm not troubled by buying a little over book value and I don't think we can beat 2Q. Well,
we have 1.8 billion, 1.9 billion shares outstanding obviously through the issuance from the deal. So I'd like to get
us back to 1.5 billion type range over the next few years and we've got this capital. There aren't enough things we
can invest $10 billion, $15 billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns we expect to generate.
So it's a mix of all three.
But clearly, we like to see more action on the dividend. Clearly, we're going to be aggressively buying back and
consistently, and clearly, we have capacity to increase our investment in the core businesses.

Hi. Sorry, can you hear me?

Yes.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
My apologies for that. I just want to start off with a question on funding and NII. Appreciate the disclosure on
funding optimization and the drivers of some of the improved synergies from the initial guidance. Now, curious
how much room there is to cut deposit costs further? It looks like your Wealth Management deposit costs up 24
bps, it's just running well above peers. And just a clarifying question regarding the NII guidance, Jon. Is the growth
you're contemplating in 2021, is that versus the 4Q 2020 base which reflects the full impact of the deal or is that a
guide versus full year 2020?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
I'll do the first – the last question first, which is that it was based on the fourth quarter. So, sort of using a fourth
quarter annualized is the right basis to be thinking about, plus again, we did have the full impact of both the
transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio.
You're right, our deposit costs were 24 basis points which were down 14 basis points for the quarter. We also saw
an improvement as you know, BDP or what we call our sweep deposits obviously at a lower rate, basically 1 basis
points relative to our wholesale that cost about 100 basis points. So, part of the funding synergies is really coming
from replacing those wholesale funding CDs and other wholesale funding with the off-balance sheet deposits that
we're going to bring back on the balance sheet.
So we started the quarter I think about 65% of our funding in the deposits were sweep. We're now at 75%. We
would expect about $15 billion to $20 billion of CD roll-off, that's obviously based on the maturities. So we
continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with
the incremental deposits from E*TRADE.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, that's great. And just for my follow-up, a big picture question, James, if you'll indulge me. And I was hoping
you could help us reconcile versus your prior target of 15% to 17% ROTCE. What rate market and capital
assumptions are underpinning your 17%-plus ambition? And I guess if we start to think about the inflection in
growth that you cited and maybe even sort of tailwinds from normalization, just higher rates which should be more
than 100 basis point benefit, greater realization of revenue synergy opportunities, further progress on the SCB,
the direction of travel there has been quite favorable. The 17%-plus longer term still feels somewhat conservative.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
I'm wondering from your perspective do you see even an upper teens or a 20%-plus ROTCE as a reasonable
long-term ambition just given the significant transformation that's underway?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
You're beginning to replace Mike Mayo. He usually asks me that. What about the plus? What's wrong with plus?
Plus means more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
You can drive a truck through that range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Listen, I wouldn't put – I wouldn't try and model too much science into this. This is an expression of our
aspiration. And as I said also, happens to be our belief. It's not just Disneyland. We believe we will deliver these
numbers and for some of the reasons you listed, rates being one of them, obviously has a huge impact on the
term. But look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were. These obviously become very
plausible. Whether it should be 17%-plus, 18%-plus, 19%-plus, listen, if we said to you three years ago our
aspiration was to have a 17%-plus ROTCE you would have thought we were off the planet. So I'm very
comfortable with these numbers.
If we could achieve this, then obviously the stock should be trading much higher than it is today. And embedded
in it, we do do some math. We start with our budget, we start with our operating performance in 2018, 2019, 2020,
we look at our budget projections, we do sensitivities around revenues, we understand what our comp and non-
comp look like over the next couple of years, whether we have major litigation exposures or not, the integration
costs that we have got to work through and then the synergies of the various businesses. And then we of course
look at the capital question which I discussed earlier I think with Christian on buyback, dividend or reinvestment in
the business and what our RWA growth is going to be in ISG and how that affects the CET1. And you put all of
that in a big washing machine and out spits a number with a plus on it.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much. James, I wonder if we could look at slide 14 and talk to something that comes up a bunch.
You show your $5.4 trillion pro forma. If you look at that fee rate, there's only one other peer on that top 10 that
has a fee rate equal or better than yours. And I think it's a good thing but this comes up plenty so I would love to
hear you talk about it, and the sustainability of that fee rate, I don't see price pressure in the Wealth Management
business, but people ask on it all the time. Just curious to get your thought process over the coming years and
what's kind of embedded in those, your medium and long-term targets implicitly with that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I don't think you're going to see price compression of any significance across the Wealth or Asset Management
platforms. It's really a function, Glenn, of asset type. So for example, the wealthier the client, if you have clients
14


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
with $100 million, they're not paying 58 basis points. They're probably paying, I don't know, close to 10 basis
points or something. A client worth $1 million is paying closer to 100 basis points. So it depends a little bit on the
business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets.
Obviously, some of the E*TRADE active trading clients have got higher velocity on them. They're going to have
higher basis point numbers and a very passive position in restricted stock. So a little bit of that is you've got to sort
of peel away what's going on under the numbers. But to your broader question, do I see price compression across
Wealth Management, no, I don't. In fact, we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking and
– the banking, lending and deposit products.
On the Asset Management side, I mean, listen, if you're driving performance in the active side you can generate –
you can hold your fees as they are. If the underperformers lose their assets quick then they lose their fees. So I'm
not terribly bothered about it.
If you knew the names of the three above us, you would probably guess them, there's a reason. They're more
index-oriented. It's a different business model. Now, we generate a higher revenue per dollar of asset, but we pay
a higher revenue comp structure per dollar of asset. So it's not exactly a 30, 40 basis point, 50 basis point win as
you know obviously.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Understood. Understood. Wanted to hear your words. Thanks. And then maybe if we could just bridge the gap. I
think I know the answer to this, too. But this is a pretty strong environment. You consolidated E*TRADE. The
adjusted margin in Wealth Management of 24%, of the medium-term target, the two-year target of 26% to 30%,
how do we get inside the range without the help of rates? Because the Fed theoretically is on hold for a few
years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, yeah, the business is growing. We had some additional expenses this year. For example, we made more
contributions to our overall philanthropic and charitable efforts, given what's going on with COVID. That cost is
distributed across the businesses. We paid a one-time bonus to all employees earning less than I think $150,000
who don't receive bonuses. Given the head count in Wealth Management that disproportionately affects that
business. So there's always a few things going on that 1 point of margin is worth about $45 million a quarter, I
think, if I'm doing my math right, $18 billion, $180 million. So something like that.
So it's not – small numbers could move it around a point or two. But I think with increased growth, increased
efficiency, better conversion of the assets, more asset flows in, generating this average 58 basis points is how
you bounce between the sort of 20 – what did we say 24% to 30% range – 26% to 30%. I'm sorry, 26% to 30%.
And depending on the environment, I mean we've started the year strong. That probably helps 1 point if that held
up. There you go.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Thanks. Good morning. First question, just want to come back to some of the questions on organic growth. And I
like the slide 9 that shows the $8 trillion in assets held away, essentially making the point that you already have
the customer reach. And so just trying to think about whether you view kind of all of that as potential wallet that
you can go after, or said another way, are there any products that maybe don't line up in that $8 trillion? And then
as the firm becomes more connected through technology which I think you guys have done a great job over the
past couple of years, how do you think about your strategies to connect with a greater percentage of that, call it,
$8 trillion. I know every business has a little bit different, call it, sales process, but are there new strategies or
even financial incentives that you can think about to really accelerate the penetration into that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I'll give that a crack. We're not naive. We don't expect to have 100% of the wallet of all of our clients. So,
clearly, we don't expect to bring in all $8 trillion over time. But there's significant overlap as you note in these
channels and in these Wealth figures.
We continue as you saw through the net new assets as James mentioned. A lot of that was from existing
customers consolidating their assets. A lot of that is being driven by the technology that we've made and the
investments that we've made in the platform that help our advisors advise their clients and we've seen people
bring in more assets. So I think if you think about the opportunity set, I think we tried to line it up pretty well
through the different channels on the workplace. I think it's really around retaining cash and retaining vested
assets and then, over time, growing the relationships.
Self-directed at a minimum, we've seen people leaving the E*TRADE platform as their needs got more
sophisticated and they needed advice. We're clearly going to capture the top part of the funnel with our FAs, with
the FA-led model that we have. So, again, a real opportunity and I like the way you described it, just look at the
numbers, 2.5 million households – almost 5 million participants in 6.7 million households, the breadth and reach
of the platform is quite large. And there is some overlap there, but it's still over 10 million clients that we can
provide incremental services or bring in more assets from.
In terms of connectivity, as you could imagine, we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients
to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need. With the E*TRADE acquisition we
bring on incremental digital capabilities. And as you can imagine, this year we're spending the year trying to figure
out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients.
We're going to pilot around lead generation. We've defined the advisor group who's going to work with new
clients. We've got scoring systems. We've got artificial intelligence trying to help predict what people are going to
want, need, and next best action. So it's really a culmination of all the investments that we made, plus the digital
from Wealth, and we're going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these
pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay, terrific. Thanks, Jon. Just a follow-up here, just on the core expense structure and trying to think about
some of the benefits of 2020, with the pandemic that were deflationary; we're seeing that, as some of those
benefits roll off, there's some inflationary aspects into 2021 kind of on a core basis. But, longer term, obviously I
think we've learned a lot about the businesses through the past 12 months and opportunities potentially to drive
some longer-term savings or maybe core deflation in the expense structure. So I'm just – would love to get some
16

thoughts around how you guys are thinking about areas or opportunities to maybe drive more expenses out of the
system based on what you've learned over the last 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would say we're still learning. Crisis is not over. We clearly are hopeful around the rollout of the vaccine. I
think there are going to be some takeaways around some of the digital client experiences that we've been able to
do, the work from home that we've been able to do. But I think it's a little early to start making those decisions.
Let's get through the crisis first.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. The strategic update and growth outlook are always
helpful. Just on the efficiency ratio, given the 70% level in 2020 and you realized strong revenues in this
environment. But with E*TRADE and Eaton Vance operating at a better ratio, I think the longer-term Wealth
Management margin improving maybe 600 basis points. Just what drives the conservative outlook? Like are there
areas that you want to invest significantly to continue to drive the growth? Or are there areas for potential
improvement on that 70% level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Listen, I think we said under 70% after two years. So I don't think that's conservative. Mike, we were at
79% just a few years ago, and I think when I started we were much higher. So the long-term position is we'll run
this place with a 30% margin plus. What happens in the next two years with the bouncing around the markets, I
don't know, maybe we're too conservative in the short run, but it doesn't change our behavior I guess is what I
would tell you. We are very determined to drive this company for growth and for efficiency and for returns. That's
been unambiguous for a decade now.
So, it doesn't change our behavior at all. It's just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a
minimum to achieve in this time period and that's what we try and to put in the two-year period. The longer term
we're much more aggressive. But we deal with reality of two years. This year, as I said, if you annualize the way
this year started off, we'll do better than the efficiency range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. No, that makes sense. And Jon, just one clarification on the Wealth Management, you gave a lot of
numbers on the outlook just given the E*TRADE deal. I just wanted to clarify, on the funding benefit, did you say
80% in 2021 and most of that by 2Q and then same thing on the expense synergies. I heard a 25% and 40% so I
just wanted to make sure I had the right number just in terms of what you're recognizing in 2021. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think all those numbers that you gave are correct. The funding synergies are really from this transition
from the off-balance sheet, the on-balance sheet and the runoff of the wholesale deposits. So, again, that skews
17


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
more towards the back half and the 80%, when you get into the second quarter, you'll be using a quarter number,
not a full year benefit number. And then, 25% on costs and approximately 40% on the integration costs as well.
So, yes, those are the right numbers.

Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Sorry. Apologies for that. I thought the comments on net interest income outlook in Wealth Management were
very helpful and I just wondered if I could get you to talk in a similar way about the Asset Management fees and
the transaction revenues in Wealth Management. Because versus my estimates I thought Asset Management
was a bit below, maybe that's a lag with the rising AUM. But obviously transaction revenues were very strong. So
could you talk about those two revenue drivers within Wealth Management, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. On the Asset Management fee line, obviously the exit rate as you know we get to benefit now for the full
year of the $1.5 trillion in fee-based assets. You have averaging effect and exit effect in terms of 2021. So now at
the $1.5 trillion assets, we'll also have the benefit of the net new assets that we bring in over 2021, though on an
average basis we would expect continued growth obviously in that line. We had over 10% growth year-over-year
in that Asset Management fees.
And then on transactional it's really going to be around client engagement and client activity levels. Fourth quarter
we benefited from elevated transactional. I did say that that was helped by the DCP number which presumably
may or may not repeat next year but the margin on that revenue as we've talked about in the past is virtually zero.
And so transactional generally has been declining. We now have the E*TRADE platform inside of Morgan Stanley
so the commissions based on their options trading as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number. So
we'll be at a new level. But generally, that is going to be driven by volume-related activity and we'll have to see
how it plays out, recognizing the first 11 days have been pretty good.

amortization of intangibles, you said you're going to be amortizing the intangibles, I'm just wondering about the
amount of that and where we see it?

Sure. Why don't I just give you a few? So, again we issued $11 billion of equity or about 230 million shares, we
generated $7.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles. You'll see that in the first couple of pages of the supplement. Of
that, goodwill and intangibles, about $3 billion is going to be amortized at a rough rate of about 15 years, so about
$200 million and that would be allocated in the non-comps in the Wealth segment.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Hey. Good morning. Maybe we could talk a little about the momentum at E*TRADE. I just want to confirm the
numbers. If I looked at their second quarter sort of retail client base is around 5.8 million self-directed clients. And
then I think at December, the fourth quarter it was up to 6.7 million. Are those apples-to-apples and if so, that
implies quite a bit of net new account growth of close to 900,000. That's pretty good momentum. Just maybe you
could discuss what's driving that and how you feel about that going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think we tried to lay that out as I said on page 7, you can see what pre-closing, so the September 30
number shows self-directed assets within Morgan Stanley before the deal closed. So, yes, the growth has really
been in the E*TRADE channels. Your number of about 900,000 is accurate.
Again, I think from our disclosure going forward, we had to conform sort of definitions and whatnot, but they've
had real strong growth with new clients given the activity levels this year.
It's a number you'll be able to track whether the self-directed channel is growing through that number going
forward. I don't think we're going to be explicitly disclosing net new clients within the self-directed channel as we
try to integrate and bring these two businesses together.
