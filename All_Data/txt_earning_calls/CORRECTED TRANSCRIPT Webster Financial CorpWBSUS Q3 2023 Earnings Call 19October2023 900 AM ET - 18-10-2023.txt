Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Emlen. Good morning and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's third quarter 2023 earnings call.
We appreciate you joining us. I'll provide remarks on our high level results and operations before turning it over to
Glenn, to cover our financial results in greater detail.
The results we announced today further illustrate the power of Webster in terms of earnings potential, as well as
our sound operating and risk profile. We continue to enhance our liquidity position and in contrast to broader
industry trends, we grew deposits by $1.6 billion. We also grew our net interest income and materially expanded
net interest margin in the quarter.
In the quarter, we also completed our core systems conversion, marking a significant milestone in our integration
and we are pleased with the outcome and did so with limited client disruption. Our streamlined technology
architecture will allow us to further enhance client experience and more efficiently deliver for our clients in the
future. Achieving this outcome took an exceptional effort on the part of our colleagues, particularly our client-
facing colleagues and those dedicated to the conversion. I want to express the gratitude of our executive team,
directors, and shareholders for their efforts.
With the core conversion complete, we expect our company's financial potential will become even more evident
over the near- to medium-term, and we will have significantly more opportunity to build upon our operating
capabilities going forward, including services that allow us to enhance noninterest income in our Commercial,
Consumer, and HSA businesses. Furthermore, our colleagues will direct their full attention to continuing to grow
the organization, as they deepen existing and develop new client relationships, enhance our product capabilities
and client service, raise Webster's market profile, and keep operations running smoothly.
With that as an introduction, I'll get into our financial highlights for the quarter. I'll start on slide 2. On an adjusted
basis, we generated EPS of $1.55, with solid results across nearly all of our income statement lines. And PPNR
grew 2% from the prior quarter. This generated an adjusted return on assets of nearly 1.5%, and an adjusted
return on tangible common equity of 21%. Our efficiency ratio remained at 42% among the best in the industry.
We grew our deposits by almost 3% over prior quarter and we were able to grow net interest income despite a
decline in loans. As we have discussed in our prior calls, and at our Investor Day in March, we've continued to
evaluate our capital allocation and the risk return dynamics across lending businesses, since our merger closed
nearly two years ago. We've discussed with many of you that the time would come to deemphasize some
businesses where our resources and capital could be better allocated, and we are starting to see some of that
today, particularly in an environment where liquidity is at a premium and the credit environment remains
uncertain.
In the quarter, we focused our loan origination efforts on franchise building, full relationships, C&I and non-office,
commercial real estate. We purposely deemphasized our mortgage warehouse activities where balances
materially declined. As a result of our deposit growth and more targeted loan origination activities, our loan to
deposit ratio improved 83%, providing us a ton of flexibility, as we move forward.
We have a solid loan pipeline and feel good about our ability to continue to safely grow earning assets, even with
the backdrop of sluggish loan demand. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio and TCE ratio are strong at 11.2% and
7.2%, respectively. Our robust capital position and returns provide us a great deal of flexibility and optionality in
terms of capital deployment, whether it be organic growth, share repurchases, payment on our common dividends

or in selective instances executing on complementary acquisitions such as the interLINK and Bend transactions
that we've executed on, over the last two years.
On slide 3, we again provide a profile of our diverse and unique deposit funding. Many of you have seen this slide
a few times now, but we like to highlight what we believe to be one of our key competitive advantages, particularly
as deposits exit the banking system. The deposit growth we generated this quarter was a team effort with most of
these channels contributing, and Glenn, will provide more details on our deposit growth shortly. This business
profile also enables our robust liquidity position, which we review on the following slide, slide 4. We again
increased our immediately available liquidity to $19.8 billion from $18 billion last quarter. In the most recent
quarter, our uninsured deposits fell to 22% of total from 25% last quarter. And our liquidity coverage of those
uninsured deposits grew to 148% versus 124% last quarter.
I'll touch on our office CRE portfolio and credit in general, as we turn to slide 5. Office loan exposure continues to
be a focus of our conversations with investors, and we continue to actively manage our risk in that asset class.
Notably, we've proactively reduced our office exposure, which is now under $1.2 billion or 2.3% of loans, including
actions taken this quarter, we've reduced the portfolio by $500 million, since the second quarter of 2022 or 30% of
the original balance. The portfolio is generally well secured with an at origination weighted average LTV of 54%
and a current debt service coverage ratio of 1.9 times. No delinquencies in the portfolio and a low level of non-
accruing assets. Note that, of the remaining portfolio, almost two-thirds of our exposure has some level of tertiary
support in the form of a guarantee or reserve.
Overall, while it's clear that the credit environment remains uncertain and that the industry trends indicate some
level of bumpiness, as we move forward. We remain generally pleased with the resilience and credit metrics in
our existing loan portfolio. While our commercial classifieds increased in the quarter, they remained well below
pre-pandemic levels.
Our nonperforming loans and charge-offs remain stable and at historically favorable levels. We continue to add to
our overall allowance for credit losses, and our 1.27% coverage of loans and leases compares favorably to peers.
We continue to proactively manage credit exposure in our portfolio to ensure early identification of problem
credits.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more details on the quarter.

Glenn I. MacInnes
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings. We
reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $222 million with earnings per share of $1.28. On an
adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $267 million, an EPS of $1.55, excluding $62
million in pre-tax merger-related expense. Merger-related charges were associated with our core conversion,
which was completed in the third quarter and will decline significantly in the fourth quarter.
Next, I will review our balance sheet trends beginning on slide 7. Total assets were $73 billion at period-end,
down $900 million from the second quarter. Interest-bearing deposits, primarily cash held at the Fed, was $1.8
billion at period-end. We averaged $1.2 billion in cash for the quarter, in line with what we anticipate going
forward.
Our security balances were relatively flat in the quarter, as we reinvested proceeds from maturities and sales.
Loans were down $1.5 billion, reflective of both lower loan demand and a decline in non-strategic loan categories.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Deposits grew $1.6 billion in the quarter, and we reduced borrowings by $2.6 billion. Deposit growth was across
several product types and business lines, including over $250 million in noninterest-bearing deposit growth.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 83% in the quarter, down from 88% last quarter and we anticipate operating in the
mid-80s going forward. Our capital levels are consistently strong. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.2% and
our tangible common equity ratio was 7.2%.
Tangible book value decreased to $29.48 per share, reflecting the impact of AOCI, the dividend, a small share
repurchase. This was partially offset by retained earnings. Unrealized security losses included in tangible book
value increased to $819 million after tax from $645 million last quarter, driven by higher rates. In a steady interest
rate environment, we anticipate roughly $125 million of this would accrete back into capital annually.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 8. In total, loans were down by $1.5 billion or 3% on a linked-quarter basis.
The Commercial Bank continues to drive loan trends, where declines were reflective of both lower demand and
declines in non-strategic categories. Mortgage warehouse was down $600 million. Commercial real estate was
down $100 million, as we continue to reduce our office exposure. And C&I was lower by $900 million. The yield
on the loan portfolio increased 14 basis points, and floating and periodic loans were 59% of total loans at quarter-
end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 9. The total deposits of $1.6 billion from prior quarter were 2.7%.
We saw growth in all major deposit categories with the exception of savings. Growth was aided by the seasonal
inflow in public funds, along with growth in interLINK, Commercial, and HSA.
In our Commercial business, we continue to recapture balances that have left in search of diversity earlier this
year as well as new clients. Our total deposit costs were up 24 basis points to 196 basis points for cumulative
cycle-to-date total deposit beta of 37%.
On slide 10, we have updated the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions. We anticipate our cycle-
to-date beta will reach 40% in the fourth quarter of this year. While the macro data has pushed out the interest
rate cycle. We would still anticipate a beta in the low- to mid-40s by the middle of 2024. Our expectations here
aligned with our outlook for which we assume no further Fed increases at this point, with cuts beginning at the
back half of 2024.
Moving to slide 11, we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for
the prior period. Overall, adjusted net income was up $7 million over prior quarter. Net interest income was up
$3.3 million, as we continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet. Adjusted noninterest income was
flat, while expenses were down $2.3 million. We also benefited from a lower tax rate, 20.1% this quarter, down
from 21.7% in the second quarter, partially offsetting these trends, the provision was up $5 million. The net
interest margin was 3.49%, up 14 basis points from the prior quarter. The NIM benefited from more normalized on
balance sheet liquidity, as well as our asset sensitive position. And our efficiency ratio was 42%.
On slide 12, we highlight net interest income, which grew $3.3 million linked quarter. Net interest margin
increased 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Our yield on earning assets increased 17 basis points from the
prior quarter, and the pace of deposit pricing moderated to 24 basis points. It's important to note that our total cost
of funds were up just 4 basis points, as growth in core deposit categories was used to replace wholesale funding
and brokered CDs.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
On slide 13, we highlight our noninterest income, which was flat to prior quarter. An increase in derivative
valuation and direct investment gains was offset by declines in deposit service fees. Transaction activity tied to
commercial clients remain slow in the third quarter, though the outlook is improving into next year. The year-over-
year decrease was primarily driven by $10 million in lower client deposit fees, $7 million lower loan related fees,
$4 million from the outsourcing of the consumer investment service (sic) [consumer investment services]
(00:13:23) platform, and lower client hedging activity.
Noninterest expenses on slide 14, we reported adjusted expenses of $301 million down $2 million from the prior
quarter. Reductions in professional fees, occupancy, and marketing were partially offset by higher employee
benefits and technology expense. Slide 15 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which were up
$6 million over prior quarter. After recording $29 million in net charge-offs, we incurred a $36 million provision
expense for macro and credit factors partially offset by the impact of lower loan balances. As a result, our
allowance coverage to loans increased to 127 basis points from 122 basis points last quarter.
Slide 16 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, nonperforming assets are flat to prior quarter
and prior year, with nonperforming loans representing just 43% of loans – 43 basis points of loans. Commercial
classified loans as a percent of commercial loans increased to 174 basis points from 139 basis points, as
classified loans increased by $118 million on an absolute basis. The balance was up, as we saw migration of a
few larger credits that we expect to cure over time.
Net charge-offs in the upper right, totaled $29 million or 23 basis points of average loans, on an annualized basis.
We divested another $78 million in office loans in the quarter. These divestitures generated $13 million of the $29
million in net charge-offs. Worth repeating, our total office exposure declined $110 million inclusive of other
actions this quarter.
On slide 17, we maintained strong capital levels. All capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal
targets. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.2%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.2%. Our tangible
book value was $29.48 a share. Including the AFS mark on our securities portfolio, our common equity Tier 1 ratio
would be approximately 9.5%, as of September 30.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 18 with our fourth quarter outlook. We expect loans to grow in the range of 1%
to 2%, with growth focused in strategic segments. We expect core deposits to be in the range of third quarter, with
a year-end loan-to-deposit ratio in the mid-80s. We expect net interest income of $580 million to $590 million on a
non-FTE basis and excluding accretion. Approximately $4 million in accretion would be added to the interest
income outlook. And for those modeling net interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly $17 million to
the outlook.
Our net interest income outlook assumes no further Fed increases. We currently expect NIM to be flat to the third
quarter. Noninterest income should be approximately $90 million. Core expenses are expected to be around $305
million, with an efficiency ratio in the range of 42%. Our expense outlook excludes the FDIC special assessment.
We expect an effective tax rate of 21%. We'll continue to be prudent managers of capital and target a common
equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.5%.
With that, I'll turn it back to John, for closing remarks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Thanks a lot, Glenn. As I wrap up my remarks, I want to hit on the implications of the proposed regulatory
changes for banks, in excess of $100 billion in assets. As it's among the topics we're most frequently asked
about, we anticipate it will be several years before we reach the asset threshold at which the proposed regulations
would impact Webster. During that time, both the application of the regulations and the operating environment
may significantly change.
As you would expect, we've already begun to build the necessary capabilities, talent, and investment to tackle the
enhanced risk framework requirements that may apply to us, as we approach $100 billion, just as we have tackled
the OCC's heightened standards requirements that came with crossing the $50 billion threshold. While there will
likely be increased financial burdens such as required debt issuance and compliance costs, there could be
several paths to absorbing and overcoming these challenges, including our increased scale and earnings power.
In the near-term, we believe our size brings a unique mix of scale and agility relative to many of our regional bank
peers. We'll utilize our strong operating position to grow in our key markets and business lines, allocating our
resources to the highest return opportunities, all within a disciplined risk management framework.
With that, I want to wrap up my comments by saying thank you to all our colleagues for their strong efforts, both in
moving our strategy forward, completing the conversion, and getting us to where we are today.
Operator, with that, Glenn and I, will open up the line to questions.

John, maybe a high level question, this ongoing de-risking that you've been doing. I guess where are you in terms
of like, how much more do you think you need to do? I mean, the loss rates on the office, the implied loss rates on
the office from this quarter looks a bit higher than what you've been doing for the last several quarters? Could you
just kind of big picture, where are you in terms of de-risking the book?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting. I don't think, Chris, there's kind of a dedicated timeline. I think we're – as you heard me say,
the $1.2 billion in office we have right now, we sort of feel good about, with respect on a relative basis to having,
getting credit enhancements, continuing to work on the portfolio. So, for us, it's looking at loans, looking at the
strategic nature of them, whether they're with investors and clients that we know very well that we're going to
continue doing business with, whether they're standalone, transactional, what the kind of metrics and dynamics
are. And then each quarter, Jason and the team sit down and say, hey, we even though this may not be a
problem now, this is something that's not strategic for us or we have an opportunity at a reasonable economic
cost to move down. So, we're not really looking at a serial reduction in the exposure. We're being opportunistic
and we're making, I think, the right economic decisions because many of these loans are going to refinance fine.
They're going to payoff fine, some of which, we think in the future may have some problems just given the
paradigm shift. But I think you'll see us continue at this level, looking at a $25 million, $75 million portfolio or book
of business in the quarter. And if there's a good economic, strategic way to exit those credits, we will. But we're
not kind of urgently and in a serial fashion, trying to get rid of the exposure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Maybe, Glenn, you gave the loan to deposit and expectations for the balance sheet. How
should we be thinking about just the level of borrowings and the securities growth from here or decline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think I'll take securities first. So, we're like $14 billion, $14.5 billion, I think you would expect – expected over
the course of, say, the next couple quarters to stay within that range, depending on loan growth. The question on
borrowings is, I think we're at a level right now where we probably expect to be pretty flat to the $2 – say $2 plus
billion mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And maybe last one. One of your peers turned the buyback back on this quarter. I'm interested in your
updated thoughts on whether buybacks at this point of that cycle make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, I think it's a great question. We bought back $50 million in the quarter, in Q3. We clearly have capital
levels and capacity to generate capital to continue the program. I would tell you that, we're looking at this from a
position of having good flexibility, but also recognizing that we want to make sure that we have capital. If we do
tuck-in acquisition, if we do grow loans, significantly, if we see cracks in the market from a credit perspective. So, I
guess the way I would characterize it is, I wouldn't rule it out, but I think we're being a little bit more cautious as
we look in the fourth quarter to our activities in that area.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire of Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Casey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just following up, I guess, Glenn, on the NIM. So, NIM is going to be flat in the fourth quarter and borrowings,
which obviously helped in the third quarter. The decline there sounds like they're going to be flat. So, what is the
offset to the beta creep that you expect to keep – to keep an implied? Is it loan growth? Just looking for a little
color on what holds NIM stable in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. Sure. So, some of it is loan growth, some of it is the rate on loans, where we get the full benefit of the
periodic loans repricing. And then you do have – we do pick up one day, at least on a NIM basis from an earnings
standpoint. And then it's pretty much some of that's neutralized by what we think deposit growth will be or deposit
cost will be going into the fourth quarter. Like I said in my comments, we still think that there's – there'll be deposit
pressure going into the fourth quarter, albeit, very more moderate than it's been certainly in the last couple of
quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then just a question on the funding strategy, I mean your deposit growth was pretty broad-
based. interLINK still is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, on that slide, was it slide 5? It's 9% of your deposit
franchise. What long-term, is that a ceiling that you have for interLINK or is that is 9% the right level just trying to
figure out how big that can become?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, we're in the process of doing our outlook over the next couple of quarters and actually years. And so, I think if
we're at 9% now, depending on our sources of funds and other sources of funds, we, that could go up plus or
minus. It could go as high as 15%. But that's something that we're still in the process of planning right now,
Casey.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And just last one for me, on the efficiency, I know it's early for 2024, but you guys obviously at 42%
are in more efficient than most of my coverage universe. John, you mentioned, you are – there are going to be
some financial burdens about, in getting the bank ready to be $100 billion. What – can you pass that along? Or is
that something that you're – you might let the efficiency ratio drip up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a good question. And again, as Glenn said, we're working through our plan now. And we're not going
to sort of – we're not ready to provide guidance for 2024. But I will tell you, our sense is, look, we still have some
opportunity coming out of the conversion, as we consolidate sub-ledgers and look at back office processes and
consolidate call centers, which we still haven't completed. So Casey, we do still have some merger-related cost
opportunities, cost save opportunities. And I kind of like where we are.
Our feeling is we also have opportunities to invest and grow, particularly if the market greenlights with respect to
loan growth and people feel comfortable about a soft landing. I think we can identify additional teams in
Commercial Banking to bring on. We're definitely investing in our products and capital markets, and FX, and card,
and other commercial treasury products that enhance our balance of noninterest income. So, our kind of view is
we think we can operate steadily in the low-40s efficiency ratio. And to the extent, we can gain more cost savings
that will – it'll provide us an opportunity to invest in key products, and services, and people.
So, if we can continue to post the numbers that we promised when we did the merger, the 20% ROATCE, the
1.5% ROA, and an efficiency ratio in the low-40s, I think size, scale and momentum will allow us to keep that
efficiency ratio in the low-40s without starving the bank with respect to future investment. And then if you fast
forward, right, three years, you look at the size of our balance sheet, as we approach $100 billion. I think we'll
have some optionality and we'll be in a better place than others who are similarly situated, given how kind of
efficient our operating model is.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt, so far, so good. We've talked about it before those companies that we underwrite, they're tend to
have protectable, predictable cash flow streams, recurring cash flow streams, contractual cash flow streams. And
so, we haven't seen a deterioration, significant deterioration in the credit profile. I'd say, it's behaving like the rest
of the book, probably some level of moderate negative risk rating migration, but it hasn't spooked us at all. And
again, I – it's always hard to predict the future, but one of the wonderful things about that portfolio besides the
type of companies that we lend to are the private equity firms that we've been doing business with for 10 and 20
years that are kind of flushed with cash, raising new funds, and really not reticent to capitulate and give up these
really good companies.
No question about the fact that these are floating – generally floating rate loans. So, their debt service has
increased. They generally are lower in contractual amortization. So really, it's the interest expense. And so far, the
capacity to continue to service that debt has seemed strong. And obviously, we feel comfort in the fact that we've
got strong private equity firms behind those companies, in case things start to go sideways. Generally, we work
things through with them and the deals continue to perform. So, so far, I'd say it's coming out according to
[indiscernible] (00:28:49), which is they're able to service the increased interest rate cost. And we seem to have
pretty, stable performance in that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, just a reminder, what is the size of the – what needs definition of leveraged loans and then anything
beyond that, that would be considered a syndicated loan portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is – it's tricky because there's overlap everywhere, right. And we reported on our regulatory statutory
leverage loans that – those have actually remained relatively flat over the last couple of quarters. It's about 6% of
our total loan book or $3 billion. And most of that, as you intimated, is in our sponsor and specialty book. Our
shared national credits are about 12%, and there are some subset of that which is leveraged, but about 12% of
total loans. That number is actually down from pre-merger of Webster numbers, as a percentage of total loans,
just given kind of the mix that came together between Webster and Sterling. Again, no kind of differentiated
performance there.
So, I've told this story a million times to the Street over the last 15 years about shared national credits. We don't
have a buy-side desk. We're not a [indiscernible] (00:30:12) for the big banks or the non-banks who are
syndicating out loans. Our use of shared national credits over the last 15 years has been in strategy or in
geography or in product, meaning that it's a middle market or corporate company within our middle market
footprint where we have cross-sell opportunities, direct access to management, but they have a $700 million
credit facility, and certainly we don't have the balance sheet to provide that.
So, we'll participate in that credit and cross-sell. It's in our sponsor and specialty group where we have expertise
in technology and other industry verticals where we'll strategically participate with access to management.
Again, we underwrite and portfolio, manage all of our shared national credits exactly the same way we do a
bilateral credit. And our shared national credit book has a weighted average risk rating of about a full 0.5 turn, 50
basis points better than the overall weighted average risk rating of our commercial portfolio, because those bigger

companies tend to be more resilient and have more revenue streams. So, those are the data points. And I figured
I'd share with you our view on how we go about underwriting and participating in shared national credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
So, understanding, it's likely a blend of the leveraged loan portfolio, probably some real estate in there. Is it fair to
assume the underwriting characteristics like sponsor and specialty from a leverage perspective are similar to that
book and from a commercial real estate perspective or similar to the LTVs and debt service coverage ratios, we
find in....
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's a fair statement. But I'll also tell you, we have very little shared national credit exposure in
commercial real estate. And I mean very little. Most of our shared national credit exposure is in sponsor and
specialty, in our middle market geography groups on mid-corporate and large corporate relationships we have
and then we have some in asset-based lending. Those are the ones I worry about the least. Those are large
retailers, strong agents, cash dominion. We generally don't have any problems with those transactions. So, we
don't have very much shared national credit exposure in commercial real estate. It's just not been one of our tools.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Last one for me, John. You had mentioned keeping capital handy for perhaps tuck-in
acquisitions. I know historically it's been discussions around perhaps HSA tuck-in acquisitions. But I was curious if
that comment meant anything broader, as in whole-banks or other sorts of fee income vehicles?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. A great question. And I think we quite clearly mean sort of complementary acquisitions around fee
generating or deposit gathering businesses where we have a path to some organic growth, but we'd like to
enhance. And speed up that path to get a better balance of noninterest income and interest income rather than a
whole-bank acquisition. We don't feel that right now. You never say never. And I've learned my lesson there. But
given where we are, the great integration and conversion we just did, given the look at the dynamics in the
marketplace, I would say, the highly, unlikely whole-bank activity on the inorganic side. And it would be something
it would be targeted on further low cost deposit gathering or fee generating businesses that are complementary to
our existing activities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hi, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Glenn, I wondered, if you could share your thoughts on restructuring or selling available for sale securities in the
fourth quarter, given that rates may be stuck up here for a while?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it is something we looked at, Mark, and you know that we did that in first quarter of this year. We
restructured about $400 million at that time. What I would say is, it's something we continually look at and we
balance that obviously against our capital levels and our capital forecast and things that we see as far as that. So,
I'll leave it at there. And that is something that we continue to look at. And there's obviously some opportunity
there is competing against capital for other initiatives, as well. So, that's where we are on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then can you update us on how much you sold in this quarter, in performing office loans. And roughly
where you sold those relative to par?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think in my comments, there was $78 million that we sold. And if you just do the math on the provision of $13
million, that equates to about $0.83 on the dollar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then lastly, hopefully there aren't any more failed banks. But if there are, would Webster be a
likely interested buyer and some FDIC transactions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mark, it's interesting, right? I just made the comment to Matt that whole-bank acquisitions are not high
priority for us. I do think that it would behoove us to just make sure that, if there is a clear strategic opportunity
that makes a ton of sense economically, I guess, I wouldn't exclude us, right. But it's, I'm hoping there are no
further failed banks, as well. But I think, hopefully, if we keep executing where we are, then the dust settles. I think
we'll be in a good position and have the right financial characteristics and strength to be a buyer of a good
strategic bank. If something happened that way. So, I wouldn't rule it out, but it's certainly not on our game plan.

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
We haven't disclosed that number. Obviously, it's moved up and it's at a higher level than the overall portfolio. But
we don't disclose that, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Glenn, could you maybe speak around what the puts and the takes will be, as it relates to NII and the NIM
going forward? Maybe help me better understand, the cadence of fixed asset repricing throughout over the fourth
quarter and then through 2024? And what the impact to loan yields will be to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah, let me give you a sense of and I'll just look at, the two dynamics that we have there, Brody, are the
fixed rate loans repricing. And that if you think about it, it's about $1.3 billion a quarter, right? So, if you think – you
just think about that over the next couple of quarters, it's about $1.3 billion repricing. And given our rate forecast,
you probably pick up about 275, 250 basis points on that, as it rolls forward, right? Over the next couple of
quarters. And then depending on where the Fed is in the back end of the year that might come in a little bit. But
that dynamic on the fixed rate loans, I think about it in terms of the NIM, it probably supports our NIM by about 4
basis points going forward.
And then likewise on the investment portfolio, you have about $300 million that is typically reinvested. And for
that, we're probably picking up about 450 basis points now, that'll probably drop as rates change to like the low-
3s, mid-3s. But there again, we're picking up about 2 basis points of NIM support going forward. So, if I look at
those two factors, as well as the periodic book, which will continue to reprice on the loan side. And then, so you
have that is going as a favorable tailwind. And then the wildcard here is deposit pricing, right? And so, we do think
we did see it moderate in fourth quarter. We do think it's going to continue to moderate over the next couple of
quarters. And then the Fed will begin to cut. There'll be a natural like 90-day lag on that. But we think the support
that we have on the repricing side, reinvestment side will sort of moderate any pressures that we get on the
deposit side, at least for the first half of the year. And then we should actually, we should be well-positioned, if the
Fed does proceed with cutting on the second half, back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And then, John, I know you talked earlier about, kind of the leverage loan and the
sponsor, specialty sponsor book. But I guess I wanted to better understand kind of like, some of the finer points of
the details of the underwriting there and kind of the things you do to structure those loans to really give you
protection? And I'm not expecting you speak to the specific credit, but, like, you all were on the right aid credit files
for bankruptcy. But like, the ABL FILO notes in the market are trading at 92%, 93% of par. And so, like market
obviously expects very little loss. It looks like you guys and the other banks are in a position to kind of get paid
back first, and it feels really well collateralized. So, could you just kind of help us better understand the structure
of those deals and, what you kind of do to help protect yourself in the event that something goes wrong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I guess there's a couple questions there because you threw in the ABL deal at the end, right. And so, that's,
I think that's a completely different animal. You're underwriting against liquidation value on a large retail company
15

that's kind of standard asset-based lending. I do think the market believes what everybody believe is someone will
come in and provide debt financing and there'll be an orderly liquidation and everyone will get paid out. And we've
seen that story play over and over again.
In sponsor and specialty business, I guess it's about the strength of the people, the continuity, we've been doing it
for 20 years. We deal with sponsors. We know who support credits and have expertise in the industries and
sectors they're in. You'd be amazed at the level of diligence and detail we do in technology, if we're doing a deal
as software-as-a-service deal, we're doing third-party evaluations of the software. We're evaluating the contracts,
the end users where we know the management team very well, we know the sponsors very well. We structure the
deals that – so there's some level of amortization we don't chase. As you know, the last couple of turns of
leverage where the non-banks are chasing, we play in a different market.
So, it's just a combination of having the right people, a really disciplined approach, staying in the swim lanes and
the sectors that we know and understand and not moving off of that disciplined process. And it's why through the
great financial crisis and through the pandemic and through this higher interest rate environment, we've been able
to see, resilience in that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then the last one from me, I just wanted to ask around the HSA book, I feel like this has been a topic
that's come up sporadically, over the last several years. But I wanted to ask just because other banks are looking
to potentially monetize unique assets that they have. And so, when I look at kind of what's happened, in HSA, it
feels like some of your non-bank competitors have been able to really kind of pay really high multiples to acquire
other HSA portfolios that otherwise, I think if they had the same investor base that you do, they wouldn't be able
to pay as much.
And so, with the growth in that business line kind of slowing to some extent and the value of it really not showing
up in the multiple and it being tough to kind of inorganically grow that business. Just given that you're treated like
a bank versus others that are treated like non-banks. Like how do you think about maybe monetizing that and
doing something more strategic there to help your investors realize the full value of that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
That's a great question. And I think all of your observations in general are correct. And we've talked about it over
time. The basic premise for us is that we have a very efficient way to deploy long duration, low cost deposits, as a
bank. That really helped profitability for us. And while the market has slowed, if you look at it, you're still growing
deposits at very low costs in the mid to high single-digits. And there aren't many channels that are doing that. So,
and we are continuing to grow along with the market, on an organic basis. So, I take your point in terms of the
inorganic growth of some of the other top five players. So, it is very valuable to us. It helps us generate the kind of
returns and profitability we have, albeit, it's a smaller part of the whole after the MOE.
We are frustrated that the market doesn't recognize the value that we're still building in that business, as part of
the bank. And as you know, we continue, we talk about it all the time to evaluate HSA, in the bank and the value it
has, in the bank, outside of the bank, because we have an obligation to make sure that we're making the best
decisions for our shareholders, as we move forward. And so, up until now, it's continued, particularly in this
interest rate environment, it's pretty easy for us to say operating HSA as a division of our bank creates the most
value for our shareholders in the long-term. In terms of the quality and the value of the cash flows, we don't think
the market where we're trading at a 7 times multiple on future earnings is reflecting that unique company and

business. And we want to continue to keep informing people and educating people about where we are. We were
able to execute on [ph] Bend (00:45:21) transaction last year, which gave us, higher levels of user experience and
a better mousetrap, if you will. And I think it's helped us compete in the marketplace.
We are still looking every time there's a deal in the market, another portfolio, because the market keeps
consolidating. I think the top 10 now represent 83% of the market. We'll try and be in a participant in that. But I
think it's going to be to continue evaluation for us and we'll make the right decision on where HSA belongs, given
the value we can create owning it or the value that it would receive as a different company or a company that was
part of a joint venture or somewhere else outside the bank.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just starting in the decline in the commercial,
industrial, commercial loan areas, and you talked about de-emphasizing some asset classes there. Just give a
little more detail on where you were pulling back? And I apologize, I jumped on a little late, if you already covered
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No, it's quite all right. It's a good question. And we haven't covered it in detail. So, the decline across the board on
the C&I side was generally driven by, we had mortgage warehouse obviously down. And I think you'll likely can
see that continuing to reduce from a strategic perspective. We were very careful on transaction-only ABL and
equipment finance in the quarter, since the crisis in March. And so, those did grow rapidly and may have had
small declines. Our fund banking activity which high quality fund banking loans, equity subscription lines to private
equity firms, was down about $0.5 billion. And that was driven by one big payoff. And then just lower utilization.
Our overall middle market C&I utilization on lines after kind of holding steady for several quarters at 50% was
down into the mid-40s. So, we did see seasonally lower usage and I don't know what that portends, in terms of
client confidence or anything, but utilization was lower as well.
So, that kind of drove the quarter results. Some of it was us pulling back on levers, some of it was a seasonally
slow third quarter, more sluggish loan growth, and that's where we ended up. I think as you go forward, we've
talked about really making sure that we have the liquidity capacity, the loan to deposit ratio and the capital to grow
those full relationships across our middle market businesses or other ancillary C&I businesses, sponsor and
specialty, non-office commercial real estate. We are seeing some level of increased demand as we move into the
fourth quarter. Our pipelines up about $0.5 billion. So, I think – you think we'll make – we'll continue to see
mortgage warehouse run down. There may be a couple of other small subscale businesses where we won't be
generating the kind of loan growth that we've generated in the past. But we think we can offset that with our core
franchise building loan generation.

Terrific. And then on the flip side, the commercial classified loans were up, both on an absolute basis and as a
percentage of that portfolio. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what drove that increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Happy to. First of all, I didn't say up in my front comments, but I did reference that, that level of classified,
that 1.74% of a smaller portfolio in the quarter is actually 100 basis points lower than Webster's classified
percentage in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic. So, just a reminder, again, that we've been, the
entire industry has been benefiting from really, really favorable credit metrics. And this is just a small step, I think,
towards a more normalized rate going forward. But in terms of the actual contributions there, there weren't any
kind of correlations across geography, asset class business lines. We saw some C&I and healthcare. We had a
small portion in ABL. We had some office migration that we talked about prior, and then just generally across the
other C&I categories. So, it really wasn't – we didn't see correlated risk, we just saw credit-specific migration as
part of our overall modest negative risk rating migration in the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Terrific. And lastly, just one for Glenn, on the hedging strategy and how you expect the net interest income
would react to rate cuts, if they do materialize next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Daniel, good morning. We did talk a little about that, as we look, we're not providing an outlook for 2024
at this point. The point I made earlier is that, I think our NIM will continue to be supported into the fourth quarter
and into the next couple of quarters through the benefit of both fixed rate loans repricing, investment securities
repricing, as well as the periodic loans repricing. Some of that will be obviously offset by deposit cost in our
thinking on where the cumulative deposit beta will end up. But I think generally that's how we're feeling going into
the next couple of quarters.

Hey, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, I want to touch on deposits. So, noninterest-bearing deposits were up on a period end basis in the quarter.
What drove that uptick? Was it seasonal inflows? And is it fair to say that the customers chasing higher yield
products in these demand balances are largely done?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, let me take that and John and – but I think there is a portion of the increase in noninterest-bearing
deposits that was related to the government inflow, which is seasonality. But I think the bigger point is, we've gone
back and looked at DDA, because we're, as we look at our forecast and I've gone back to, all the way back to
2019 when if I add the combination of Webster and Sterling, we had about $40 billion in combined deposits. And
at that point, the DDA represented about 21%.
If I looked at the third quarter and did the same sort of analysis, and I stripped out the impact of interLINK, it's
relatively new, will be in that 21% range. So, it's pre-pandemic. And if I look to where we are, it's typically run
about 21%. I think there will be some continued normalization in the average balances, as customers move. And
we've looked at this on a customer by customer basis. So, there is some migration into higher yielding type of
products. But I think some of that to say, I think look at normalization over the next couple of quarters, but I think
some of that will be offset by growth opportunities through whether it's new relationship, acquisitions or treasury
management type services. So, I think if you think about that [ph] 114 (00:53:13) we have, there will be puts and
takes on that. But over the course of time and we're not giving guidance for 2024, that should be somewhere in
the range.

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
I agree with that, Glenn. Yeah, Alex, I think your last statement was right that we're going to continue to see a
creep up of the deposit cost there in the core, but that the rate of increase is slowing down because the customer
behavior, people that were more in tune and it was more important to them to chase rate, have done so.

Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. And speaking of growth opportunities, now that the conversion with Sterling is done. Do you see any
material cross-selling opportunities in terms of growing these demand deposits? Now that you're integrated with
Sterling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think I kind of hinted to that, Alex, that one of the things that getting on our single core platform
now and also being able to kind of pivot our resources to development and build out, we've got a robust plan on
the treasury side in commercial, and that's broadly defined with cash management products, FX, capital markets,
other products, corporate card, where we believe that having deeper penetration and having a broader product

set for our really, loyal commercial customers will have the added benefit of growing core operating deposits. So, I
do think that that's something that we believe we can execute on and we believe will be successful as we move
forward post-conversion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Lau Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you for that. And then I just had a follow-up on the HSA business. So, these balances, for the past three
quarters have been in the $8.2 billion range. Can you talk about what it would take in the macro environment for a
stronger HSA adoption for these balances to start increasing? John, I think you said mid to high single-digit. How
do we get to the higher end of the range? Would a weaker job market actually benefit this range? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, it's interesting. We used to answer these questions all the time. But I think generally higher healthcare costs
push companies to higher adoption of full replacement, high deductible health plans. Definitely, if it was in a
recessionary environment, if labor market is not quite as tight, companies are more willing to move to higher
replacement cost. I will tell you we believe that part of full transparency, right, part of the reason the market
slowed a bit is that there's been significant penetration and adoption now. So, there aren't as many green fields in
terms of new opportunities.
But in this economic environment and in this job market environment, we have obviously seen slower growth. And
I'm not rooting for a worse job market or a big recession, so that we get a slight increase in our HSA growth. But I
think those are some of the dynamics. There are higher healthcare costs coming in. So, I do know that people are
continuing to look at it and [ph] Chad (00:56:27) does see opportunity. And we're obviously got a lot of RFPs out
there. But the market, from the 20% growth days, down to the 10% growth days, there's a lot of dynamics there.
And it's not just economic, it's also just a maturing of the industry.

one question, so we can get everyone in. The next question comes from the line of Bernie Von Gizycki of
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So my question is – hey my question is on fees specifically. So, you talked about the pressure on fees from less
capital markets activity, but you have seen signs of an improving outlook into next year? What are you hearing
from clients? What signs do you see that helps drive that improving outlook? And maybe if I just combine this on
the Sterling integration, you basically highlighted some areas in treasury cash management. But, in the fee side,

could you provide any size timing of these opportunities? So, cap markets pick up next year and Sterling
integration opportunities sizing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. I think I'll stick with Glenn's comment that we're working through our plan right now for
2024, and we haven't sized some of those opportunities and the timing of the rollout. As it relates to BAU and
organic, where we are, we did see in the quarter a relatively healthy level of noninterest income and underneath
that were some good signs, a little bit more of direct investment equity tag in income which shows some more
activity on the sponsor side and that people may be getting more active, as they normally do at year-end. And so,
we're – that's a good sign for us as we move forward.
Obviously, the swap market, given where interest rates are, has been kind of down, but we may see some more
activity just given the fact that the Fed may pivot. So, there's some decent signs and then we'll be able to, as we
give guidance in Q4, we run out our roadmap on plan, be able to maybe size some of the incremental benefit of
post-conversion investment.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I'm wondering what the remaining credit mark is on the Sterling book. And then if you look at the linked quarter
increase in allowance, how much of that is commensurate with the linked quarter increase in classified loans?
And I'm just wondering, kind of your expectation for allowance trajectory here, given the macro backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. A good question. I always kind of like and dislike answering these CECL questions because there's
obviously a huge amount of work that goes into the modeling. Obviously, a classified loan has a higher reserve on
it. So, the dynamics in the quarter for CECL would be higher level of classified, overall lower loan balances, stable
non-accruals and charge-off levels and economic outlook for us, as we're moving forward. It's why you still see a
build in most of the industry right now because of concerns of office and others and then, qualitative overlays on
what you believe is going on in any particular portfolio, like an office portfolio.
So, the classified certainly would have been a component to add more reserves, but there are some offsets like
lower loan balances and stability in other areas. And then obviously the economic outlook is still uncertain, which

drives to a few basis point increase. And I'm giving you kind of the qualitative high level because obviously it's all
model-driven at the end of the day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And Timur, it's Glenn. The only thing I would point out is – we sort of laid this out on page 15 of the slides,
right. So, you can see the impact of lower loan balances was $8 million. And then the macro – third quarter macro
and credit environment was a build of [ph] 43 (01:00:38). And if you look at the chart below, there hasn't been that
much movement, really in unemployment and GDP growth and stuff like that. So, a portion of that is risk
migration, which you see in the classifieds. And that's how I'd sort of characterize it.

Operator: Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Laurie Hunsicker of Seaport Research
Partners. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Great. Hi, thanks. John and Glenn, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
So, just wanted to circle back to office here. So, slide 4 is great, but just wondered couple of things. Number one,
can you help us think about specifically in New York City and Boston of that $1.17 billion, how much of that is
New York City Class A versus Class B, how much is Boston Class A versus Class B? And then also your slide 4
is only investor. Can you help us think about the owner-occupied book, how big that is? Any concerns that you're
seeing there? Obviously, owner-occupied is lower risk, but and is still some of the same risks. And then the last
part of the office question, the jump in past due loans from $46 million to $71 million, roughly. How much of that
$20 million jump was office-related? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
All right. I may ask you to come back on the last question, but the one [indiscernible] (01:02:00), the mix of A and
B is pretty similar around 50-50 in all the markets, which also ladders up to the overall. We've about 23%, right of
the remaining offices in New York City and that's about 50-50 Class A and Class B. Boston is smaller in the
geography, under 10% of that, and it's also about 50-50 in terms of Class A and Class B. You asked about non-
investor CRE, owner-occupied CRE. So those would be C&I companies that we lend to where we have office
collateral, that's a relatively small portion of our overall portfolio. It's around $250 million, which is pretty small,
regulatorily and internally we underwrite those, as you know, C&I loans based on the cash flows of the company
with having just the enhanced secondary source of repayment in the office. We've seen no deterioration in that
portfolio at all. And what was the last question, Laurie?

Yeah. Just the [indiscernible] (01:03:11) – the jump in the past due loans, the $46 million to $71 million, how much
of that, if any, was offset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Oh! that's a great question. I don't know, if I know the answer to that offhand, but I will tell you one thing is that
there was a $15 million payment made on the 2nd of October. So, one of them was an administrative
delinquency. And so, I would tell you that we're down from $42 million to whatever that would be, $27 million, if I
can do my math, right. Mostly equipment finance loans in there. So, it really wasn't commercial real estates.
