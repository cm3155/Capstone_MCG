Ilene Fiszel Bieler
Executive Vice President, Global Head-Investor Relations & Chief Operating Officer-Global Markets and Global Credit Finance, State Street Corp.
Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then
Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2023 earnings slide presentation, which is available

Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter financial results. As
we issue these results, the world has witnessed a surprise and unconscionable terrorist attack on innocent Israeli
citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in Israel and Gaza. These terrible events have shocked the world
and created further global geopolitical uncertainty.
State Street stands with the people of Israel and we are united with all those impacted. Now turning to the third
quarter. Global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in July turned
decisively negative as the quarter progressed.
Against the backdrop of softening economic data, market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global
central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher for longer interest rate environment and an economic
hard landing.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
As a result, equities fell, while global bond yields continued climbing around the world, reaching levels not seen
for many years, with the US 10-year yield reaching its highest level since 2007. Despite these factors, the third
quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility.
Turning to slide 3 of our investor presentation. I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you
through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Third quarter earnings per share was
$1.25 or $1.93, excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning, which was a notable item in
3Q.
EPS growth year-over-year, excluding notable items, was driven by our significant common share repurchases
during the period, coupled with a 3% increase in total fee revenue. This fee revenue growth reflects higher
servicing and management fees, better front office software and data fees and an increase in other fee revenue.
Taken together, the benefit of share repurchases and improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower NII,
market headwinds within trading businesses, as well as the impact of year-over-year expense growth.
That said, we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, which help us to contain
that expense growth while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses.
Turning to our business momentum. Within Investment Services, total AUC/A increased to $40 trillion at quarter
end, and we recorded $149 billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter, largely driven by wins in
official institutions and private markets. The estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in
future periods associated with 3Q asset servicing wins amounted to $91 million, which is the highest level of
quarterly new servicing fees in over two years, demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving
stronger sales performance.
Encouragingly, Alpha's momentum continued in 3Q. We deepened relationships with existing mandates and
recorded two new Alpha mandate wins, including our first Alpha for private markets mandate for one of the world's
most influential investors.
During the third quarter, we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our Investment Services franchise as
we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our State
Street Alpha value proposition. Importantly, we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share and
reinvigorating revenue growth. We are executing against our plan to improve core back office custody sales
performance as it is our largest revenue pool, installed quickly has significant scale and drives high-margin
ancillary revenues.
As an illustration of our custody sales momentum in the power of Alpha, in the third quarter, State Street and
Vontobel, a premier global asset manager headquartered in Switzerland, entered into an agreement to expand
our existing front and middle office relationship by providing back office services subject to the necessary
approvals. State Street had no relationship with Vontobel until discussions began in 2020 around Alpha, resulting
in the adoption of our front, middle and now back office services.
Key client wins such as Vontobel demonstrate how Alpha can establish, broaden and deepen client relationships,
further positioning State Street as our clients' essential partner. It illustrates the value of the Alpha proposition and
confirms our strategic rationale of how Alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's
capabilities in a true One State Street solution for our clients from front to back. Accelerating the Alpha sales cycle

and implementation timeline, particularly back office services remains important strategic priorities to drive even
more fee revenue growth.
Turning to our front office software and data businesses, CRD continues to perform well and has a strong
pipeline. By the end of the third quarter, annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business
increased by 12% year-over-year to $299 million.
At Global Advisors, assets under management reached $3.7 trillion at quarter end, supported by a record $41
billion of net cash inflows in 3Q.
Importantly, our cash business gained market share in an expanding market, driven by strong investment
performance, coupled with the higher yield environment. In aggregate, Global Advisors gathered $10 billion of
total net inflows in 3Q. Record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the
institutional business, coupled with the impact of risk off market sentiment in our ETF business in 3Q.
While our ETF franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in 3Q, our US low-cost SPDR ETF franchise
continued to be a bright spot, generating $7 billion of net inflows, gaining further market share. To drive continued
growth in 3Q, we reduced the price on 10 low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, demonstrating our commitment to
delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points.
Lastly on business momentum, I am proud to highlight that State Street's foreign exchange business has once
again been recognized as the industry leader. After being ranked number one FX provider to asset managers by
Euromoney Magazine in 2022, this year, Euromoney Magazine 2023 FX awards named State Street as the
winner across four categories including Best FX Bank for Real Money Clients, Best FX Bank for Research, Best
FX Venue for Real Money Clients and Best FX Bank Sales.
Turning to our financial condition. State Street's balance sheet, liquidity, and capital positions remain strong. Our
CET1 ratio was a strong 11% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. This strength has enabled us to
deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders. In 3Q, we returned $1.2 billion of capital, buying
back $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means
that cumulatively, over the last four quarters to the end of September, we have returned approximately $5.6 billion
of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends.
As we look ahead in the fourth quarter, it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our
existing authorization of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.
To conclude, amidst the challenges of the market environment in 3Q, we remain dedicated to driving stronger
business momentum and improving fee growth. To that end, in the third quarter, we outlined our sharpened
execution plan for the Investment Services business, underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating
sales and revenue growth while simultaneously improving the discipline and accountability for this execution.
Our laser focus on expense discipline also remains high. We have a well-established track record of re-
engineering our processes and transforming operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth.
In the third quarter, we reduced expenses quarter-over-quarter and announced another step in our multiyear
productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model, while enabling even greater investment in our
business.

As part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we are streamlining our operations in India, have
now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country. This consolidation will continue the
transformation of State Street's global operations and enabled us to achieve productivity savings as part of our
plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024.
Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on slide 4. We
reported EPS of $1.25, which was down year-on-year due to the impact of the $294 million loss on sale in
connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio, which will benefit NII in future periods. EPS was up
year-on-year at $1.93, excluding the repositioning, which you can see on the right-hand side of the page.
Turning to the core business. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, total fee revenue grew by 3% year-on-
year, driven by growth in our front, middle, and back office Investment Services business as well as solid
management fee performance at Global Advisors. This performance enabled us to offset some of the industry-
wide headwinds we saw in our global markets business as well as lower NII given the mixed macroeconomic
backdrop in the quarter.
Lastly, we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment, limiting expense growth to
just 3% this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver a positive fee operating
leverage in 2024.
Turning now to slide 5, we saw period-end AUC/A increase by 12% on a year-on-year basis and 1% sequentially.
Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and net new
business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to client flows and net new business.
While net new business was positive, long-term flows in the asset management industry have been muted, as you
can see on the bottom right of the slide. This risk loss settlement leads to the current headwind across the
servicing industry.
At Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 13% year-on-year and was down 3% sequentially. Relative to the
period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of $10
billion.
Notably in the quarter, our cash franchise continued to perform strongly, generating a record $41 billion of net
inflows as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains. Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased
mainly due to lower quarter end market levels.
Turning to slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily
from higher average equity markets, net new business, and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by
lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds, and a previously disclosed client transition.
Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the lower client activity and adjustments
and the previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity markets.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
As I've mentioned over the past year, we continue to see lower levels of client activity and flows, all of which
impact transactional volumes, leading to a 2 to 3 percentage point headwind on servicing fees year-to-date. Part
of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business. The full year effect has ranged from minus 2% to plus 1
percentage point impact over the last five years.
Within servicing fees, back office services were generally consistent with total servicing fees. Middle office
services, which is part of the Alpha proposition, had another quarter of good growth. On a year-over-year basis,
middle office fees were up 3% and up 1% sequentially, largely driven by net new business.
On the bottom panel of this page, we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. We won $149
billion of new AUC/A. We onboarded roughly $250 billion of AUC/A in the quarter, primarily in the asset
management client segment. And importantly, as Ron mentioned, we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue
wins of $91 million this quarter, which will be recognized in future periods. These servicing wins underscore the
progress we're making towards stronger sales performance.
While we've historically only described wins in AUC/A terms, we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that
a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in the $300 million range this year. You can measure us against this
benchmark. We now have about $2.3 trillion of assets to be installed and about $255 million of servicing fee
revenue to be installed as well.
Turning to slide 7. Third quarter management fees were $479 million, up 1% year-on-year, primarily reflecting
higher average equity market levels, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees
into NII. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 4% as a result of higher equity market levels and record
quarterly cash net inflows.
As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned
with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had neutral
overall flows but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the SPDR Portfolio Low-Cost
Suite. As you know, we strategically dropped the fees on about a third of our low-cost suite of products and
expect more growth in the coming quarters from this action.
In our Institutional business, notwithstanding net outflows of $30 billion in the quarter, which were primarily driven
by client in-sourcing, both our defined contribution and index fixed income products continue to drive strategic
momentum.
Lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of $41 billion as we captured some of
the cyclical movement of cash in financial system. I'll just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-
quarter.
Turning now to slide 8. Third quarter FX trading services revenue was down 2% year-on-year, while up 3%
sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower direct FX spreads and lower
FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the growth primarily reflects higher volumes.
Industry volatility is down 25% to 40% across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a
year ago and down 5% to 10% sequentially which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads.
Securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower specials activity and lower agency
balances. Sequentially, revenues were down 12%, primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent
industry drop-off of US equity shorting activity and specials.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, but down 15% sequentially, largely driven
by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Other fee revenue increased $49 million year-on-year, primarily due to the tax
credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments.
Moving to slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 2% year-on-
year, primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services
revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients to the SaaS environment, which now accounts for
about 60% of our clients, partially offset by fewer on-premise renewals.
Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise
renewals, partially offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains
strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products.
Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel. We were pleased we had two more
mandate wins in the quarter for Alpha. Most notably, we also had our first Alpha for private markets win. We also
meaningfully advanced CRD's institutional fixed income capabilities.
Turning to slide 10. Third quarter NII decreased 5% year-on-year and 10% sequentially to $624 million. The year-
on-year decrease was largely due to the continued mix shift from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing
and lower average deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Sequentially, the decline in NII
performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances in the deposit mix shift, partially offset by the
benefit of higher interest rates, including international Central Bank hikes and our investment portfolio
repositioning.
The NII results were somewhat better than expected due to noninterest-bearing deposit levels coming down
slightly less than expected and the portfolio repositioning, partially offset by client re-pricing, some of which will be
delayed and will impact fourth quarter instead.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter with average deposits
declining 4% quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative US dollar client deposit betas were 73% since the start of this recent
cycle, while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continue to be much lower in the 25%
to 50% range.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, last month, we executed an NII accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio
repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads, which all else equal, should drive NII
towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of $550 million to $600 million per quarter next year.
Turning to slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially,
third quarter expenses were down 1% as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and
optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of company, including Alpha,
private markets and technology and operations automation.
On a line-by-line basis, year-on-year, compensation and employee benefits increased 4%, primarily driven by
salary increases associated with the wage inflation, higher head count and the impact of currency translation.
Sequentially, however, we brought head count down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter, in
line with our year-to-date performance.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and
infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, in-sourcing and
vendor savings initiatives.
Transaction processing increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher sub-custody vendor costs. Occupancy increased
4% as we relocate our headquarters building and other expenses were up 4%, mainly reflecting higher marketing
spend and professional fees.
Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios
followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating
environment with very strong capital levels, which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory
minimum.
As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11% was down 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter largely
driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained
earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 109% and 120% for the State Street Bank and
Trust.
In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders, consisting of just over a $1
billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year,
ending September 30, we repurchased approximately 12% of shares outstanding.
Finally, a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook. Our third quarter performance was solid with fee
revenue growth of 3% year-on-year. We executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported $91 million
in new servicing fee wins in the quarter as we look towards our goal of $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee
wins in 2024.
And as you have seen us do for the last 4 years, we again demonstrated expense discipline while continuing to
invest in the business. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter.
At a macro level, our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards. We currently assume global
equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end, which implies the daily average is down about 3% quarter-
on-quarter, bond markets are also expected to be down about 3% on average quarter-on-quarter.
Regarding fee revenue in 4Q on a year-over-year basis. We expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up 1% year-
over-year with servicing fees approximately flat and management fees to also be flattish as we expect the year-
on-year business drivers similar to what we saw this quarter.
We do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third
quarter. We also expect that our markets businesses will be down modestly year-over-year, given lower volatility.
We expect software and processing fees to be up 10% to 12%, largely due to the timing of on-prem renewals and
the expected new SaaS installations and we expect the other revenue line to come in at around $30 million to $40
million in the fourth quarter.
Regarding NII, we now expect 3Q NII and we now expect 4Q NII to be towards the middle of the $550 million to
$600 million range we previously mentioned. This includes continued expected rotation of about $3 billion to $4

billion out of noninterest-bearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing, which we previously noted, but with
more stability in the total deposit averages.
Turning to expenses. We remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively
flat expenses in 4Q quarter-over-quarter. As always, this is on an ex notables basis, and in this regard, we are
keeping an eye on the likely FDIC assessment. And we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 4Q will be
around 22%.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Your first question comes from Mr. Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Thanks everybody. Hey, Ron and Eric, I was hoping maybe we can touch
on your comments earlier around positive fee operating leverage into 2024, which is definitely very encouraging to
hear after a couple of years of good cost management already. So as you think about the revenue uncertainty
between the markets and customer flows, I guess, what is the range of outcomes you're assuming for fees as you
look out into 2024? And if revenues prove to be more challenging than the base case, is there enough room to
still deliver that positive fee operating leverage. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes, Alex, it's Ron. I mean, we're facing that comment largely on two things. One is we feel like we've got quite
good visibility around what we're doing from a cost perspective. So we feel like we've got a series of initiatives
underway that will continue into 2024 on managing our costs, while also continuing the investment program that
we've got in place. That investment program includes some investments that will drive revenues in 2024 and
beyond.
But also, the second thing it's based on is some of the actions we've taken around strengthening our sales and
sales effectiveness. And just pointing to the results we had in Q3, the note that Eric just made to you terms of the
visibility we have on 2024. So those two things are confidence in expenses and what we believe is a nicely
developing pipeline and a set of sales capabilities and processes.
I mean, obviously, markets could turn everything upside down, but based on a reasonable market forecast and
not necessarily one that's going to be necessarily a tailwind. We do believe we can achieve positive fee operating
leverage.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
That's great. And I appreciate the new disclosure on the backlog and the revenue backlog, definitely helpful. So
maybe within that, can you help us maybe understand the cadence of how quickly some of that $255 million of
backlog will sort of get converted into servicing fee revenues. Is that expected largely over the course of 2024,
some of that is going to spill into 2025. And then ultimately, do you think that's going to be enough offset some of
the BlackRock related outflows and revenues that you still expect? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Alex, its Eric. Let me answer that from a couple of different directions to give you some texture because as we
think about go-forward fee revenues, right, part of what matters is installing the backlog. Part of what matters is
new sales, right, sort of maintaining the third quarter momentum in the fourth quarter and into next year because
some of those sales actually come through in the subsequent few quarters. And then as we talked about back in
September, making sure that we're very effective on our retention activity. So, every one of those matters.
In terms of the backlog, we said there's about $255 million of revenues in the backlog on the servicing fees and
north of $2 trillion on an AUC/A basis. The implementation is a little bit different in each the regards. In terms of
revenues, we think about 5%, 10% of that will come through specifically in the fourth quarter. So, that's included in
our guide. We expect 50% to 60% of the $255 million to come through next year and then the balance in 2025.
So, it's kind of a good mix and aligned with what we'd like.
The AUC/A implementation is a little more – a little quicker. Just sometimes that happens, it's quicker, sometimes
lower. That's a little closer to 30% in the fourth quarter and around 60% next year. But those will move around as
they play out.
But we've got good visibility now and what we've been particularly pleased with on our third quarter sales in
particular, but a lot of that was around back office services. And back office services, as you know, are one of the
fastest to onboard and implement, and that's going to provide some momentum into the first half of 2024.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey guys. Good morning. Eric, just one follow-up at the fourth quarter NII, you're expecting to be in that middle of
that kind of $575 million zone and then you're talking to the upper end for next year. I just wanted to ask you to
walk us through that direction of travel. Like what are the factors that start to turn to perhaps positive as you exit
the year into next year with regard to either left side repricing or just deposits getting to the right zone? Just kind
of walk us through the moving parts. Thanks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Yes, Ken, its Eric. As you surmised, there are a number of factors that matter, especially at this point in the cycle
as we transition from declining NII to some level of stabilization, and we see a good rationale for some uptick from
fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year.
So, let me just go through them, right? There's a continued amount of rotation of NIB, non-interest-bearing
deposits. We still expect some in the fourth quarter, but we expect that that starts to flatten out the beginning of
next year. We'll see exactly how much when. It's hard to call. And it moves around. We've got quite a bit of
visibility into our repricing, especially for our largest and most sophisticated clients, I described that last year.
And then we're through a good bit of that. We have – we executed on some – more of it in the third quarter. We
expect and we have very good visibility in the fourth quarter. And so kind of the repricing effects and the catch up
is kind of a bubble that works its way through.
On the tailwind side, we then have the investment portfolio rolling through and the investment portfolio matures $4
billion or $5 billion of bonds quarter. You've got the new bonds come on roughly at 200, sometimes 300 basis
points higher than the ones that are maturing. And so that's what's giving us a positive trajectory. And so it's really
those three factors plus a little bit of lending growth and some of our other actions that we can control that we
think starts to shape stabilization of NII, as we get from fourth quarter to the first quarter. But it will depend. There
will be some movements. And as you know, we update all of you as frequently as we are in public, and we'll
continue to do that. But those are the trajectories and our expectations at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. Thanks. And my second one is just the costs were, I think, a little better than you had thought and
you're flat to 4Q also, probably a little better than the market thought and a slower implied year-over-year rate of
growth. Just wondering, have you done anything incremental to slow the organic growth rate of expenses? And is
that something we should think about as go forward as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes, Ken, its Ron. I mean, there's a number of initiatives underway as we, I think, always talked to you about,
we've really got an ongoing productivity set of actions underway that is comprehensively looking throughout the
organization. Some of the things that are underway now, we mentioned what's going on in India. And this India
JV, bringing that inside, I mean this JV goes back to our early days in India before we had our own center of
excellence there.
It's going to enable us to eliminate redundancy and eliminate a lot of oversight activities, so we'll be able to take
down costs there, take down repetitive costs. We've got a comprehensive look at operating models throughout the
business, which is – will start to yield results into next year. We're looking at some – where work gets done
throughout the world and are there places where we can move and combine things, create more end to end.
So it's a series of things. Some of them – a lot of the easy work has already been done. So some of these things
have been – the work has been underway for a while, and we'll start to realize the benefits of it. But we see
visibility such that we can make the statement that we are that notwithstanding that we continue to make
significant investments in the business that we feel can keep our cost in reasonable check.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
And Ken, I'd just add that the other thing that we that we have bear down on effectively that we talked about over
the last quarter or so is our hiring freeze. I mean what we found is we've got outstanding individuals and people in
our team and part of what we need to do is we reinvest in different features of the business or different areas. We
actually need to reallocate some of that talent to those areas.
And actually, at the same time, we need to find efficiencies in others. And so that's been – while it is hard work,
it's been an effective way to actively manage our team and our human resources. It still means we invest in all
that we need to do for new products, functionality, regulatory requirements and so forth. But the reallocation that's
born from the – from this sort of freeze is actually a very effective tool for us at this stage in the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. Ken, what I would add to this, I think what we're talking about now is the continuation of what we started
going back to 2019. That was rudely interrupted by COVID and everything that occurred coming out of COVID.
The disruption, the great resignation, the issues that arose out of that with service quality and where we needed
to overinvest to make up for some of the turnover that we were seeing that led to the kind of cost increase that
you saw. That's all been normalized. Service quality has stabilized. And so I would say that we're back on the
path that we started back in 2019 and overcome what we saw in the kind of 2021, 2022 period.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, Ron and Eric and thanks for taking my questions. One question on your expectations for 4Q, Eric.
Encouraging to hear that you still are expecting noninterest-bearing to find a stable point here in the beginning of
next year. But when you think about your fourth quarter expectations, are you thinking that the typical seasonality
that we see in deposits will come through? And is that embedded within the middle of that range of $550 million to
$600 million for NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, its Eric. Yes, broadly, but with the asterisk that seasonality that we've seen has moved around a bit,
sometimes a little stronger or sometimes it's a little weaker than typical. So we do see a bit of an uptick in a
normalization in total deposits. And so we'll – we've guided to stabilization, maybe we'll see an uptick, we'll see.
But this is based on really quite deep analysis of our client deposit base.
Remember, we manage it on a US dollar, we manage each of the foreign currencies. We have – just in NIB, for
example, I think we have 30,000 accounts, right? The average account size is $1 million. We've seen the trends
in the largest, most sophisticated clients and largest accounts come down quite a bit. The smaller ones tend to
have a flatter line and evolution.

So the guide is based on that plus a little bit of the seasonality. And we'll just update as we go. But I think we
started to see some amount of inflection here. But we want to be careful, right? There's still some amount of
rotation playing out. There's some amount of balances and pricing coming through. A good bit of which we have
visibility into, but it'll take a little time to just work through it in the next few months and quarters.

Brennan Hawken Q

Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe following up a little bit on Ken's question. I'm sure at this point you're
going through the budgeting process for 2024. Do you have any preliminary expectations for what you could be
looking at for expense growth – operating expense growth here in the next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, it's early to do that. We – I think what gives us confidence and actually the feel of necessity on fee
operating leverage is we need to run the business in a way that is healthy for our shareholders and various
stakeholders at the same time. And we need to find a way through that. We've certainly gone through a strategic
planning exercise. We do that through the summer, July, August and September, and we've got a path forward,
we believe, both on the top line and on expenses.
It's a little soon to get into that, but we're working through that. And part of what we're doing now is actually
making sure that we have detailed plans, business by business, function by function. We have – we run
alternative scenarios. We even developed contingency plans and we also – we are careful about metering out our
spend next year. What we do add to spend. We're going to do that with stage gate. So there's a lot going on right
now, and we'll come back with a full set of guidelines and guidance in January.
But I think we're confident that we'll – we've got a path forward here that will be healthy and fee operating
leverage is a very good way for us to think about it and for – I think, for you guys as well.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Glenn, it's Ron. Obviously, you know the kind of growth that the private markets have seen whether it's private
equity and more recently, private credit infrastructure, and we see none of that abating. Private equity may be
taking a bit of a pause, but all of the fundamentals point to those industries increasing. And in fact, many of the
large – if you look at some of the large multi asset managers, a lot of their growth is actually coming from private.
Much of that business today remains in-sourced, and there's very few standards in the business. A lot of it gets
serviced in very expensive locations and is not a very good experience for the ultimate LP investors. So it's a very
fast growth area for us and it becomes more important for the sponsors, for the actual firms to actually get their
arms around this because the average ticket size is going down. 10, 15 years ago, the LP investors – typical LP
investor, it was an institution. It was a pension fund or sovereign wealth fund.
Today, the average investor is some affluent person that's in some kind of a pooled fund. And so getting this all
right is actually quite important. And the demand is very high for us. We're investing a lot in it, a lot of technology
in it and increasingly, as these firms become multi-asset, not just focused on in one area. The idea of an Alpha
front-to-back kind of thing and all that's associated with it – with data becomes very important, both as providers,
but also as investors. So the opportunity here is not just the big private providers, but also the big private
investors, the sovereign wealth funds and asset owners here. So yes, we see it as a very significant opportunity
for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
And Glenn, just to add a little bit of the kind of quantitative elements this. The private markets broadly to find
around the world. From a servicing fee standpoint are growing in the 9%, 10% a year. We described our
performance, which is – has been quite strong in that area. And based on our client base and our pipeline, our
expectation is that we should be growing in the 15% range next year.
Part of that is because we serve so many large global asset managers who have a wide range, both in traditional
products and in privates, right? So they're coming to us and partly because increasingly, we're serving the classic
alternate and private organizations, right, who increasingly want to focus on what their core investment process is
as opposed to processing. And so we see more and more outsourcing and opportunities for us from that segment
as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Maybe just one follow-up to all that detail. You were early on the – a lot of the offshore outsourcing. You were
early on hedge fund outsourcing and it helps you on your growth rate over time. Do you have a sense that you're
early here? Do you think you have a head start and competitive edge on this private front? We just don't see the
same competitive landscape. So I'm curious on your thoughts. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
It's a little bit hard to tell, Glenn. I think that we – certainly amongst the traditional asset servicers, we think that
we're early. You've got some of the very focused fund administrators that do some narrow kinds of activities in
there. And certainly, in terms of offering a full front-to-back solution that includes data, as far as we can tell, we're
the only ones out there. So yes, we think in general, we're early.

Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny from Morgan Stanley. Your line is already open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So the industry has been seeing servicing fee rate pressure for a while. Can
you update us on what you're currently seeing in terms of fee rate repricing? And are the newer wins coming in at
a lower fee rate than your existing contracts or a higher fee rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Ryan, its Eric. The overall cadence of fee re-pricings have been stable for us, I think for the industry last couple of
years. As you know back in 2019, we went through a phase of higher repricing, but they've been relatively
consistent in that kind of 2% or so headwind level, which is not that different from what it was over the last 5, 10
years. So that's been relatively stable.
What we have seen is very good fee rates on new business. And part of that is the discussion we just had in
privates, where just because of the nature the activity, the servicing, it tends to be a manual-intensive process.
The fee rates are multiples of the average fee rate for our business.
And in fact, the last couple of quarters, we've seen fee rates on new business comfortably above the average that
we've seen. You can just do a little bit of comparison and we'd be cautious about doing it for every quarter, but
take the last few quarters of AUC/A wins, the last few quarters of fees wins and you kind of – you get to that view.
And we've mentioned that in ways in our quarterly reports this year, in particular.
So, I think in some ways, what we've been able to find is that with Alpha, we bring more to a client across the
AUC/A base, right? So, we have fees on the front office side, which we disclosed separately, but both the middle
and the back office, we have complex clients and so that's been quite fruitful for us.
And then the alternatives and privates is a very – is a much higher fee rate area just by virtue of that industry. And
that together is what gives us some of the revenue kind of momentum that we've seen into the third quarter of this
year, and we expect in the fourth quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. That's helpful. And if we look at the quarter, it looks like the servicing fee rate over average AUC/A did
come down a bit. Was there anything driving that? Is that just function of lower volatility and timing? Or is there
anything else in that number that we should think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
No. If you just look at the aggregates, remember, you've got this kind of effect where – when equity markets are
up, right, you kind of have this natural thinning in the fee rate just because of how the fee schedules are

structured, right and they're not quite like they are in the asset management business. So that's been fairly – that
was expected and in line with the ranges that we've been seeing.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just actually to follow-on, on that last one, Eric, and just
doing the math, just – and if you can confirm if I'm correct on this, the $91 million over the $149 billion is the
appropriate way to look at that, and that would be 6 basis points as opposed to the $255 million of servicing
revenue be installed over the $2.3 trillion representing more than just like 1 basis point or so.
So, I guess, first of all, is that – are we – am I looking at that correctly? And is it all characterized as servicing fee
revenue and guess what's driving that – is that differential sort of a sustainable type of new revenue win run rate
for, I guess, some private market types of business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brian, its Eric. I'm really glad you asked that question because with new disclosure comes, sometimes very simple
answers and sometimes more textured ones. So, what you've done is an analysis, if you look at our fee wins
provided by our new AUC/A wins, which, on average, over time, I'll stress that will approximate the rates that of
the wins.
The challenge is in any one quarter, remember some of what we win is on existing AUC/A business. So Ron
mentioned, one of the global asset managers, we added back office to that relationship. Those AUC/As were
already in our base. Why? Because we had already been doing both front and middle office processing for them.
So in a way, those fees wins in the quarter cannot be compared to any of the new AUC/A. That's kind of apples
and oranges.
On the other hand, sometimes the opposite happens, right, where we're – we might be adding a AUC/A and a fee
that's quite high, one that's quite low because we're just adding a small service, and we've had some of those
over the last couple of quarters. So I'd just be cautious about the quarter-by-quarter math. I'd encourage you over
time, we can look at that through time.
But I think what we'd encourage you to do is take a look at the revenue, the wins on a revenue basis against the
base of servicing fees, right, $91 million in a quarter against the $5 billion of servicing fees is a very healthy
amount of revenue. And our ability to maintain that momentum gives you an indication of the kind of sales
effectiveness and the growth dynamic that we can create net of the retention rates that we need to manage to.
So I encourage you to spend the most time. There you can do a little bit of AUC/A wins versus the AUC/A base
that gives you another indication. But I'd encourage you to do it in that direction because you'll get a better
indication, I think, of our momentum.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's super helpful. And then the follow-up would be on the deposit beta, the differentials between the US
and non-US. And we've heard this from the other custodians as well in terms of non-US deposit betas being
significantly lower than US And just maybe some thoughts on as we move into this – into 2024 and potentially
Europe maybe even higher for longer versus US potentially? And should we see more aggressive or I see more
incremental deposit beta moving through the non-US markets to sort of almost catch-up to the US or not so
much?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Our current indication, and we're well through the cycle in US, at least we think so, we'll see. It feels like there's a
little more to go on the International side, and it started later, so it's harder to read. We do see that there are some
structural differences in the market around deposit betas between the US currency and the non-dollar even for the
same clients in some cases. And part of that is just the – you've got this non-interest-bearing versus interest-
bearing construct in the US and internationally, you tend to have just an interest-bearing deposit construct. So it's
a little more – it's a little more straightforward.
So as I've described, we have cumulative deposit betas in the US 70% to 75% range. We expect that will float up
a little more as we kind of – as the cycle, let's say, finishes could go up another 5, 10 percentage points, but it's
starting to level off.
In Europe, we're in the 25% to 50% range of cumulative beta. I think it can go up another 10 points, maybe 15
points, we'll see. But it's not going to reach the same levels that you have in the US based on the indications we
have. And the way we – both reprice and we see others competitively priced in the market. So fairly different
between the US and the international currencies.
In some ways that plays to – that's good for us. We know how to manage in both US and non-US currencies.
We've continued to have some tailwinds in NII in the international currencies. We obviously need to make sure
that we share some of that with clients. But given the international composition of our balance sheet, that's one of
the areas that continues to be supportive of our – in a positive way of our NII trajectory.

Hey, I guess good afternoon. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One on capital, I think heard you regarding
completing your [indiscernible] (01:00:23) up to $4.5 billion in buybacks for the year. Just give us a sense with the
CET1 at 11% close to your target. How are you thinking about capital management going into next year? Would
you rather operate with some amount of excess capital as you look forward to some of the macro uncertainties
relative to just continuing buybacks and paying out any excess?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Let me start on that, Ebrahim. We – it's Eric. Capital is one of the most important elements of the balance sheet.
And we spend a lot of time thinking about what are the levels of capital, how to manage. And it is based on facts
and circumstances, right, the economic environment, the uncertainty, our confidence in earnings and earnings
momentum, what we can see in the strength of our balance sheet, right? We're incredibly liquid, and we have a
very upmarket lending book, which is quite high quality. So many things come together.
I think what we've laid out on the page on capital in the materials is that our minimum requirement is 8%. We tend
to run with a very healthy buffer above that. We've got a target range in the 10% to 11%. And we've been way
above that range, partly because of a little bit of history over the last two years and we bring that down. But in
both at pace and also in a thoughtful way.
I think what you'll see us do, and I get – I say this is given what we know today because we're going to be careful.
If markets disrupt, then you slow a little bit. If you've got a lot of confidence in market fees and there's confidence
then you might go in the other direction. But the middle of that range is a good place for us to aim towards, partly
because you want to keep a little bit of extra, that's still 2.5 percentage points above the requirements.
On the other hand, there are some uncertainties in the world and doesn't feel like we should run down to the lower
end of that range right now, right? That feels like it would be – it wouldn't be appropriate. So there's a range for a
reason, I guess, is what I'd say. We've been returning capital at pace in the last few quarters, $1 billion or more.
We certainly like to continue return capital at pace. You can kind of do the math of 11%, go down to middle of the
range.
You got to remember there's pulled a par that matters from the AFS portfolio that provides a tailwind and capital
accretion, there's earnings. And then there's the RWA management. You saw RWA tick up a little bit this quarter.
Our goal is obviously to continue to optimize RWA and turn that into an advantage as well. So, we see quite a
healthy buyback going into the fourth quarter. We've got authorization, plenty of authorization to deliver on that.
We know it's important to our shareholders and have, I think, a good path forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful and thanks for walking through that, Eric. And just a follow-up quick question around NII or, I guess,
as you're thinking about ALCO management, is there – as things reprice on the asset side within the securities
book, are we kind of holding duration relative to where the back book is, will at any point the thought process
evolve to adding duration? I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the cycle, the environment we might be
for next few years and how that informs the duration you're willing to take on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Ebrahim, the answer is all the above. So, every one of those factors matter. If we get more steepness to the yield
curve, right, that would encourage us to add some duration. At the right time, we want to – we may need a little
more duration to protect against falling rates, right?

That's what you want to ideally be ahead of that. On the other hand, rates could move upwards further, and so
you want to be careful. I think we're careful in how we've configured the portfolio. You saw us do some of the
repositioning. We unwound $4 billion or $5 billion of bonds, we've reinvested towards the middle of the curve, but
also at the front-end, right? We have – so it's not just an average duration position that we are focused on, but
where are the points across the curve.
And then there's a whole window of work that we do around the US curve, the euro curve and then the other
foreign currencies. And then there's also a mix of duration. Clean duration we put on through treasuries and some
of the convexity products like the agency MBS. So there's a wide range, but it's an active discussion, I'd say, at
ALCO and one that we think will both be – we think of it both on an economic basis but also on a risk
management and protective basis that we'll have, I think, quarter-to-quarter.

Steven Chubak Q

Hey, good afternoon. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Eric, I want to ask a follow-up on the new revenue
disclosure. In the past, you spoke about the level of gross asset flows that would be needed to offset natural
attrition in the business. In a similar vein, I was hoping you could frame the level of gross revenue wins that are
required to offset natural attrition, recognizing for – I think it was Brian's earlier question that fee rates will certainly
vary depending on new wins. But anyway you could frame it in that context would be really helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Here's what I described. In the past, we talked about AUC/A wins, we had talked about, we've got $1.5
trillion of AUC/A wins a year. That's kind of volumetric benchmark. And as some of the discussions we've had,
typically, we winning on average higher than the current fee rate, and so you can kind of work through that.
On the fee revenue side and this is really around servicing fees, our goal for this year, 2023 is to deliver about
$300 million of servicing fee wins. And you can compare that to the $5 trillion of – sorry, $5 billion of servicing fees
for the year, and that kind of gives you a sense for, I'll call it, gross revenue wins.
As Ron described, we've got a series of initiatives, some of which are already playing through around adding to
sales capacity, sales effectiveness, product feature functionality and so forth.

And part of the disclosure that we provided just last month was that while $300 million of servicing fee wins is
appropriate for this year, we'd like to get closer to $350 million to $400 million next year. And again, you can kind
of compare that to the $5 billion of servicing fees. And that kind of gives you a sense of gross fee revenues.
I think the follow-on work you want to do is, just think about the other drivers of servicing fee revenue growth on a
net basis, right? There is typically some amount of attrition.
We said we'd like to have retention at 97%. So we can think about 3% servicing fee attrition. That's about $150
million a year is a way to compare the gross wins versus the gross losses. And then there's some amount of fee
headwinds, which is about 2% a year that we've described.
So what we're trying to do is create clarity for all of you on the elements of that growth, kind of the growth algebra,
I'll say it in an analytic manner, so that you can see where we're really focused. And every one of those levers
matter. We have tens efforts on each one of those.
But it's that mix of activity and the sales, servicing fee, sales in particular that will help us then deliver a core
organic growth from year to year to year. And a good way for, I think, us internally to be clear about what we need
to accomplish and externally with you all as to what the bar is for good organic growth and success.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No. Thanks for that color Eric and if I could just squeeze in one more clarifying question. There was a lot to
unpack in the response to Ebrahim around capital management.
It does appear given the 4Q buyback level, assuming you execute on the $4.5 million in its entirety that you'll be
at the lower end of that 10% to 11% range of CET1, recognizing there'll be a pull-to-par benefit, but should we be
anchoring to the 80% to 100% payout that you guys have managed to in the past? Just recognizing that there's
not as much excess if you're going to run at those levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
I think for the rest of this year, the analytics I'd encourage you to do is to think about where we ended third
quarter, kind of the middle of the range, and that's not necessarily a point, but the range to the middle of the
range. For fourth quarter, there's pull-to-par, RWA management. That gives us quite a healthy amount of
buyback. And I think the continuation of something that's quite accretive to shareholders that is substantial in
terms of capital return.
I think once we get to the middle of the range, then we're more likely to be the – that over 80% level of earnings,
but I think – and that'll be probably how we think about next year. But that's next year. I think there's – I think we
have good visibility into a good and healthy amount of capital return and comfortably over what we've committed
to, I'll call it, in the medium term.

Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So multipart question here on the asset management business. So
first, it was just great to see the money fund flows come in this quarter, and you mentioned that you believe there
was some market share gains there. Can you just touch on what contributed to those gains and maybe some
thoughts on the coming quarters? And then I look at the equity side and consistent with the industry, there was
pressure on the flows. What's your thoughts on maybe when investor sentiment could improve and flex there?
And then just last part here, when you take a step back and you look at SSGA today, is there anything
strategically that could be interesting to you from an M&A perspective to help bolster the asset mix or accelerate
some of the future growth potential in the business? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, its Ron. So there's a lot there in your question. I think on the cash business, I mean, this is a core
competency that we've had for a long time. And it's also – we've built up the capability both on the investment side
and really on the distribution and channel side. So we've got distribution and if you will, kind of hooks in the water
in many different pools. And that's including, by the way, lots of connectivity into the core custody business. So as
you've seen for example, rotation from deposits. We've captured some of that in the money market business. But
the – a lot of it – most of it's been external. Most of it's been around investment performance and, kind of, being
where the money is flowing.
The other areas that are also growing, DC is growing and has been growing for a while. Share has continued to
grow there in the DC investment only. And that's been very much product and product innovation-driven. SSGA
was one of the first to figure out how to put an annuity product into a target date fund, did it actually before it got
the broad regulatory go-ahead to do that, and that's actually now a source of real growth. So we see that as a
growth area. The defined benefit just goes away and people realize that longevity protection is something that
people need. I think that combination of a target date fund with some kind of insurance longevity product will be
important, and we've got real distinctive expertise in that.
In terms of the growth areas, I mean there's – we are really for the most part, an institutional shop. We've built out
the product capabilities in the retail and the intermediary space. Yie-Hsin Hung, who joined us as CEO late last
year. She's got a lot of expertise there, too. So some of it will be just moving and expanding share in the retail
intermediary space. And then there's a real move into blending the line between public and private markets and
the and the belief that those lines really don't make sense in the blended products where you've got sufficient
liquidity, but enable those that don't need the liquidity to take advantage of the illiquidity premium. So some of this
will be in product design, whether that's organic or inorganic, I mean we think there's opportunities in both. And
there's – the team's got lots of product development going on. So we're fully committed to that business. We see
lots of growth in that business and excited about the prospects there.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, it's been a long journey for you guys to get the front-to-back solutions in Alpha. And I'm just trying to
figure out how much traction that has and where we're seeing that in the financial results. On the one – I hear
your excitement and you have alternatives now part of that program and you're guiding for positive 2024 fee
operating leverage and you have all these new mandates. On the other hand, I look at the fee growth this quarter,
it wasn't that great, right? And so are we seeing evidence of the front-to-back momentum in the results? Is it
something that you expect to see? Or is simply such a long sales cycle that we should be thinking two, three, four
years out? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, let me just start and maybe address the journey here because this was not something that you bought off
the shelf. It was actually something that nobody had ever done before. So there was an awful lot of development
that we need to do, and I think we signaled that at the beginning. I mean, Charles River was an important
acquisition. But to be clear, that was a front, and in itself needed some investment, particularly in the fixed income
area.
So much of what we've been doing over the last several years is selling and developing. Many of the early –
particularly some of the early large ones were explicit development partners. We targeted them, they targeted us
and came in as development partners with the idea that they would help us to build this out. They've been – it's
purposely taken longer because they're the ones that are actually helping to shape what the overall thing will look
like. This has been a very, very big year. Eric alluded to it in terms of some of the features and functionality,
particularly around fixed income and getting up to not just par but to a market leading position in terms of fixed
income capability.
So in terms of just getting the program up and running, we're actually quite pleased with where we are. I don't
think we would have thought back in 2018, 2019 when we launched this, that we'd have the number of clients that
we do now.
The other thing that we're convinced of, but we had to prove it to ourselves was that this could be a tool to actually
generate new clients, that it wasn't just a way to solidify existing relationships, but it was a way to actually grow,
share and ship share. And that's what we're starting to see now. Vontobel was one, there's others in the pipeline.
So it's a journey that we believe we'll see revenue growth at an accelerated rate. And maybe I'll leave it there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
And Mike, it's Eric. On the financials, it's a very fair question. I just remind you the context for the current year
because there is some other large movements on servicing fees. So if you think about it, we recorded a 1%
growth in overall servicing fees. But there were tailwinds and headwinds away from the kind of organic new
business creation that's important that we need to demonstrate year after year. The market tailwind for year-on-
year for this quarter was about 4 percentage points of servicing fees.
So you'd say, hey, where is that? Part of that was about 3 percentage points of headwind came from lower client
volumes and activity, right, a little bit of what we described as we've seen less trading activity out there, which is –
which comes and goes, tends to be cyclical. And then the other thing we did see this year and this quarter is that
previously disclosed client exit was worth almost 2 percentage points as well.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
So there are, I think, some larger move of headwinds and tailwinds, in particular, flowing through the financials.
Net new business, if we just want to take a look at that was a positive 2 percentage points year-on-year this
quarter, and that's where we'd like to see the value of Alpha, the value of traditional servicing fee sales, the value
of private servicing fee sales. And part of reasons why we're adding to our disclosure is to make that more
apparent to everyone over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just one follow-up, Eric, and then Ron, just the exit of that large client. What inning are you in as far as
that's concerned? And then, Ron, as it relates to accelerating revenue growth from the long journey of Alpha
timing, are we thinking quarter year, several years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, on the previously disclosed client, we're out 30% through that very roughly. The bulk of that will come
through next year. And then there's another – there's – just because of how year-on-year comparisons work, you'll
get a tail into 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. And Mike, just can you clarify the question? I just want to make sure I understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. My initial question was, fees aren't growing that much, and Eric identified some headwinds to that. But you
talked about the financial benefits from Alpha, the increased activity to result in accelerating revenue growth. I
was just wondering a timeframe around that statement that revenue growth should accelerate due to the benefits
of Alpha.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. So I mean, as we signaled, I think, at the beginning, I think probably – I think it was out my answer to Alex,
the – we're telling you that we believe we're going to achieve positive fee operating leverage. There's revenues
there and there's expenses there on the revenue side, we believe we've got a program in place that includes
Alpha that's going to enable us to do that. Some of that is driven by Alpha. Some of that's driven by actions that
we're taking, some of which have been implemented, others that will be implemented this quarter and into next in
terms of strengthening sales and revenue-related capabilities. So, what you should be hearing from us is
confidence around our revenue growth generating capability. Some of it related to Alpha, some of it...

...related to the core business.
And what you should also – and the point we normally don't go into a client example that we did there, but it's
such a pure example of the strength – the Vontobel example is such a pure illustration of the strength of Alpha
because, it's an institution we had no relationship with. We began the relationship with our front and middle office.
And then we have brought along the back office, which it felt as you know, Mike, as well as anybody generates
other kinds of ancillary revenues. So, this is – that's an illustration of how Alpha is enabling us, we believe, to pick
up share that we wouldn't otherwise be able to pick up and to do it in a way that's distinctive from our competitors.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Hi Eric. Hi Ron. Eric, can you share with us – I know you're – I'm not asking you to go into details on
your budget for the upcoming year. But could you frame out for us though, the outside factors that influence the
budgeting process on expenses such as wage inflation or other types of inflation? Do you feel like there's less
pressure going into 2024 versus this time last year when you were doing your 2023 budget?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, its Eric. Yes, the headwinds have lessened. They're still there, but they've lessened. If you think about it,
when we were doing the budget for 2023, it was the fall of 2022. We actually, at that point, had done two formal
merit increases that year, some of which we're going to then play through on a carryover basis for 2023. So that
was partly a headwind. And then we had larger than probably typical merit increase by a little bit in the spring of
this year in 2023. So that's – we're not in that environment anymore. We certainly want to reward our employees
with annual merit increases, but much more in line with what we've done over the last five or 10 years as opposed
to something that was much higher. So that's on the kind of wage side benefits. We're actually continuing to see
some amount of inflationary activity, medical claims, dental, et cetera, as you'd expect. I think that's pretty broad-
based. So – but that's probably similar to prior years.
And then I think the interesting area where we're doing a lot of work on is all the non-personnel spend, right, our
various partners and vendors and software licenses, cloud computing costs, right? Every one of those is an area
for us to think about what's appropriate. And so we have – we've been having those discussions this summer and
this fall, and we'll continue to have them into the winter around next year. We're seeing inflationary increases the
way we were a year ago there. A little bit less so, but I think we're still seeing higher than we'd like, inflationary
increases there.
And so important questions are how do we offset them. How do we use technology if it is a little more expensive
to drive increasing process engineering and automation? How do we partner with fewer suppliers in some cases
and get the benefits of our scale. So there's a number of initiatives that we're working through, but that's one that
takes some more in a way. That's part of what we do during the budget process.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, our industry, the world has gone through an incredible turmoil in
the last three or four years with the pandemic and such. And now we're in this interest rate environment that we
have not seen since prior to the financial crisis. And if we assume that the Fed is higher for longer, let's say, it's
4% to 5% for an extended period of time versus the 0 bps to 25 bps that you all had to operate and the industry
operated at post financial crisis going into where we are today.
How is that – or is it changing some of the strategies you may pursue now that the rate environment is not
possibly not going back to the 50 basis points that we were accustomed to. Does that change the way you
approach the business or approach your customers that you couldn't do because rates weren't at this level three
or four years ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, its Eric. I think it has several impacts on us, which actually in aggregate tend to be positive for how we
manage and engage on our business, very tactically, higher rates and especially some steepness in the yield
curve we talked about earlier, gives us some ability to add duration and feel like that's valuable. So there's some
tactical effects there. I think more broadly, with higher rates, the value of cash in our ecosystem, we described $1
trillion of cash in our ecosystem across deposits, money market and cash sweeps and our asset management
business, our repo activity, our platform sweep activities is $1 trillion.
To us, cash is valuable for our clients to keep, especially in risk on versus – or especially in risk off and risk-on
environment. And they want to be rewarded for it, but it also means there's a whole cash wallet out there that for
us is a way to engage with clients, right? We as a bank who've got not only the banking offering of deposits but
the capital markets offering of repo, money management offering of money markets and cash management. To
us it's a way to deepen our relationships with clients.
So I think over time, you'll see us add to our product offering. Some of that's quite broad today, but we'll think
about how else do we integrate cash into, say, the Alpha proposition is a way to consider it, how do we think
about it in terms of our platforms and our markets activities. A number of those are important cash generators.
And then I think at the most senior levels with our clients, the Continue-suite actually cares about cash today.
They care about who they keep it with, how it's masked, how they are remunerated, how it's safe, but also how it
can be redeployed. And so it's become a real C-suite discussion in a way that we think can strengthen both our
relationships given our broad offering, but also one that becomes more and more of a business activity and a
business growth activity over time.
