MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to today's HSBC 4Q
2020 Fixed Income Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There'll be
some opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I must advise you that
this conference is being recorded today.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Ewen Stevenson. Please go ahead, sir.

Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, and good morning or afternoon all. It's Ewen here, the Group Chief Financial Officer. I'm joined today
by Iain MacKinnon, Group Treasurer; and Greg Case, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations.
Given COVID-19, we're actually all in separate locations, so please bear with us if we talk over each other during
Q&A. There's a fixed income specific slide deck that's available on our Investor Relation website. We don't plan to
speak to those slides in our introductory comments and we'll try to keep our comments brief as I know a bunch of
you will have already listened to various things including our equity call this morning UK time.
I'll quickly run through what we've announced today, then I'll hand over to Iain for more detail on capital and
funding before we open up for your Q&A.
Today, as you're aware, we announced our full-year 2020 results together with a business update, with a
refreshed strategy and some new financial targets, including a new dividend policy. For the full-year 2020 results,
2

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
I would describe them as a solid set of results, particularly against the backdrop of COVID-19 and now ultra-low
interest rate environment.
Adjusted pre-tax profits of $12.1 billion, reported pre-tax profits of $8.8 billion. Our core capital base strengthened
nicely with a year-end core Tier 1 of 15.9%. That's up 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and 120 basis points
over the full year. And deposits grew over $170 billion in the year on a constant currency basis, a growth rate of
12%.
Relative to the plan that we announced in February last year, the three-year target to achieve $100 billion of gross
risk-weighted assets sales in targeted areas, we delivered over half of that in the first year of the program that
we're very pleased about. On operating costs, we reduced those by $1.1 billion or 3% in 2020 and we committed
today to achieve a further $1 billion of savings by 2022 relative to our previous target.
However, the impact of the ultra-low rate environment means that we no longer expect to hit our 10% to 12%
return on tangible equity target in 2022. We've reset that target to at least 10% over the medium term, which
we've described as three to four years. And that's premised on a similar rate environment to what we see in the
markets today.
Underpinning this is a much stronger set of growth aspirations for us and Asia, both in wealth and in the
wholesale banking, with a target of increasing our capital allocated to Asia from 42% currently to over 50% over
the coming years.
On the fourth quarter, again, a decent set of results, reported pre-tax profits of $1.4 billion, adjusted revenues
were down 14% on last year's fourth quarter, which was mainly driven by the progressive impact of ultra-low
interest rates. Operating expenses were up 1% ex the bank levy, but this was mainly due to an increase in the
variable pay accrual in the quarter with the variable pay call for the full year down 17% on 2019.
Expected credit losses were $1.2 billion in the quarter, bringing total expected credit losses for the full year to $8.8
billion. And that's at the lower end of the targeted $8 billion to $13 billion range that we announced earlier in the
year.
While we do remain cautious on the outlook for credit for 2021, we still expect the ECL charge to be lower than
2020 with no update to the guidance that we gave on this at the third quarter, which was broadly a range of 40
basis points to 60 basis points for the full year. And by 2022, we expect ECL to have fallen materially from the 81-
basis-point charge we had last year towards or even below the lower end of our 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point
normalized range.
And with that, I'll pass over to Iain.

Iain MacKinnon
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Ewen. Hi, everyone. Iain MacKinnon here. Thanks for dialing in. I'll just continue with [indiscernible]
(05:50). Despite the weak macroenvironment, the balance sheet metrics continued to show strength. Our CET1
ratio was up 30 basis points in the fourth quarter to 15.9%. The $0.15 per share dividend announced today has
impacted the ratio by around 40 basis points.
During 2020, customer deposits grew by over $200 billion. Our loan balances remained broadly flat, resulting in a
loan-to-deposit ratio of 63.2% and by 8.8 percentage points since the start of the year. The group remains very

liquid with gross high-quality liquid assets of over $850 billion to hand. Despite this, our consolidated liquidity
coverage ratio was down 11 percentage points at 139% versus 2020, largely reflecting technical consolidation
adjustments in the calculation of the consolidation rather than an increase in liquidity risk. Note that this may
decline further as we implement further regulatory adjustments. The decline will have no material implications for
the group's overall liquidity risk management.
On issuance I'm pleased with what we achieved in 2020. During the year, we took a lot of action to reduce our
refinancing risk in 2021 and 2022 while delivering negative net issuance by tendering for nearly $12 billion of
MREL in 2020, we've reduced this year's refinancing requirements from $12 billion to less than $6 billion, and
next year's from $15 billion to less than $11 billion.
Looking out over this year, we expect to issue around $15 billion of MREL against maturities and calls of nearly
$6 billion. The difference is the fact that in this year, it marks the final year of material increases in the amount of
senior HoldCo debt needed to meet regulatory requirements. From 2022 onwards, we expect the balance of
senior HoldCo debt to follow the progression of the group's RWAs.
For AT1, we broadly expect to refinance our instruments that we choose to redeem of where they lose capital
eligibility. This is in line with what we did in 2020 where we redeemed nearly $2 billion worth of bonds and issued
$1.5 (sic) [$1.5 billion] in return. For Tier 2, we have no plans to issue in 2021. On IBOR, our guiding principle is
to work with bondholders to transition where we can and we look forward to bringing forward transition offerings
this year.
With that, I'll hand back to Ewen.

Thanks, Iain. Look, before we open up Q&A, I did want to take this opportunity with all of you on the call actually
to say many thanks to Iain. It's actually his last fixed income call for us as Group Treasurer. Iain's retiring over the
next month or so after many years with us both in tax and treasury. On the next of these calls, we'll have our new
Group Treasurer, he'll be known to a number of you, Carlo Pellerani. He was the recent Group Treasurer of UBS.
Carlo starts on Monday [ph] so be with us. (09:36)
With that, if we could now open up for some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Fenner, Société Générale.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and Ewen, congratulations and best of luck for the future. I've really just got, I
guess, two connected questions. On Stage 2, and forgive me if this came up this morning I may have missed it.
But obviously, Stage 2 exposures ticked up again in the fourth quarter, not by much but by some things, it
basically doubled during the year.
But I think I'm right in saying that your Stage 2 elements that is past due has not changed at all during the year.
So, I was just trying to understand what's happening there between the relationship between Stage 2 that is still
paying and those that are not paying, is there a connection? And if there is, what is it? And what might we expect
from Stage 2 balances during the course of 2021?
And leading on to my next question, where do you see – for Stage 3, I hear what you're saying about cost of risk,
but if we think about an NPL ratio, a Stage 3 ratio, do you think it peaks in 2021 and how far from the peak are we
right now? Thank you. Sorry about the longwinded question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
It's Richard O'Connor here. I'll start and, Greg, if you may be chip in. Look, Stage 2 primarily due to the forward
economic guidance and those calculations [ph] and indeed (11:50) overlays, and obviously, when we did the
yearend, then clearly in the last few weeks, maybe the economic outlook improved a little bit due to the vaccines
but, clearly, there is still some deterioration, for example, in the UK. And you're right to say that we've had a
remarkably low level of default throughout the year. We've had some – we've obviously had some hits.
In terms of Stage 3, look, we're obviously not going to get drawn too much on specific forecasts. But clearly,
Stage 3 defaults in some sense are lagging indicator. And certainly, as government schemes mature this year,
you may see [ph] the company's (12:29) Stage 3 from some of those elements, hopefully not. And then, if forward
economic guidance improves during the year, then you may see them moving back from Stage 2 to Stage 1. So I
think there's a lot of moving parts there. But broadly, as you heard from Ewen today, our overall expectation from
the charts this year remains in the 40 basis points to 60 basis points of loans. And that's been unchanged since
the Q3 stage. So you've seen the stabilization in the last few months and indeed some better macro trends in the
last few weeks.
Greg, anything to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, just on the Stage 2 sides, it's worth noting that about a quarter of our corporate loans in Stage 2 right now
were within the risk grades that we would classify as effective investment grade. And obviously, with those type of
exposures that are relatively low PDs, it doesn't take a particularly big shift for the PD to degrade to such an
5


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
extent that it falls into Stage 2. And then, obviously, while there have been a number of – the significant number of
downgrades across the portfolio, it's worth noting that the [Technical Difficulty] (13:45) and that has been reflected
in the numbers somewhat.

Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lee Street from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Analyst, Citigroup
Hello. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Lee.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Analyst, Citigroup
Thanks for doing the call. So three questions for me. Firstly on Stage 2 as well. Now, in the fixed income slide that
you've got that chart on page 11 that shows the strong or good quality credit. Obviously, that's gone from 75% of
the book down to 70.3% over the year, but Stage 2 loans have increased by sort of bigger proportion from 7.7%
to 15.5%. So is it right to compare those things together? And I suppose my question is, given the moving Stage 2
loans, shouldn't that have seen a sort of greater reduction in the stronger good quality credit being the first one?
Secondly, [indiscernible] (14:41) if you sell the French retail operations and you sell the US retail operations,
would that be sufficient to alter your funding plans? It helped us in terms of holding company senior debt for the
year given the reduction in risk-weighted assets that might entail?
And finally, on the Bank of England legacy capital review, you referred to determining whether any action is
required. In terms of making that determination, is it a question of how you interpret the capital requirements
regulation? Or is it a question of materiality or how much of the debt [indiscernible] (15:13) debt you have
outstanding? That'd be my three questions. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Richard [indiscernible] (15:19) maybe Greg can take the first.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Not much to write to Stage 2. Look, you're right to say that clearly the strong oil good has gone down in the air as
we've shown in our chart. There is another chart in the deck – sorry, we've got a lot of graphs here – which
showed actually more on [indiscernible] (15:36) migration that there was a bit more of a stabilization across the
grades in Q4, albeit, clearly, we still – we had some Stage 3 hits in Q4 as well.
6


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
So, look, the other thing I would say is, clearly, you're right to point out the Stage 3 movements for us. What I
would say is, we do use more scenarios than other banks particularly in Europe. So sometimes you just need to
go through all our work and that can obviously give you a slightly different picture to other banks who may use
slightly fewer or different scenarios in their IFRS-9 modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On that question on French and US retail and without confirming whether or not we will sell them, but if we
were to sell them, I don't think that would change our issuance plans. They're not big enough to have any material
impact. And, Greg, do you want to take the third question on the legacy capital instruments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, of course. And so on the legacy piece, the wording we used in that slide was effectively to mirror the
wording that the Dear CFO letter used. It's not necessarily pointing toward the fact that we think that there may be
any actions to take at this stage. I think it's too early to say. But [indiscernible] (17:01) peers over the last week or
so were busy looking over the various bonds that we have. As you know, we've got a relatively small amount of
bonds to grandfather into 2021. And we're going to share the analysis with the PRA and have a discussion from
then on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Analyst, Citigroup
All right. And is it interpretation of the rules or materiality or is it both?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think that's still for discussion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Analyst, Citigroup
All right. All right. Thanks very much.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Dan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan David Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good afternoon. Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for the call. Just a quick one hopefully on legacy capital. I just
wanted to touch upon your OpCo Tier 2. So although they might not cause an infection risk, I suppose they could
be deemed an impediment to resolution. So my question is, do you expect the PRA to consider other factors such
as retail holding or non-resolution entity impediments as part of the process which is going on here?
And secondly, just on ESG. So noting your issuance in the past, is there a percentage of your issuance time this
year that we should think of to be targeted in green format? And more broadly, the EC taxonomy is kind of a
positive step, I guess, to improve ESG disclosure. So can you comment on how this factors into the broader ESG
strategy at HSBC? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
All right. Greg, you start off on the legacy question and then [indiscernible] (18:42) on the ESG question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, sure. Of course. So on the OpCo Tier 2, I think again – it's still a discussion with the PRA over the course of
this year, and be it either as part of the Dear CFO letter and what comes out of that during the course of the next
month or so, but also, of course, a part of the resolution assessment framework that obviously was pushed back
by 12 months but, of course, is very much an agenda item for us for this year.
At this stage, as I said, there's not a huge amount to say on the subject. Obviously, from an impediment to
resolution perspective, we can have a view on that and we can take that to the PRA and have a discussion. But I
think it's going to have to be a two-sided discussion and we wouldn't want to prejudge that.
Just a touch on green bonds, I think we have, as you can imagine, a portfolio of green assets that we can put
together things like green bonds. And in recent years, we've been prioritizing some client business that is a bit
backed by green collateral. So, we have a number of client facilities like green CD program. We have green
structured notes. But for this year, I think we would very much like to come to market with a benchmark green
deal. It has been a year or so since we last been to the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan David Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Great. And just on the EC (sic) [EU] taxonomy, I guess many [ph] market business (20:21) is quite a big step
forward in terms of improving disclosure. So, I was just wondering more broadly if you're observing it and kind of if
you're factoring into kind of the way you're progressing as a ESG-aligned bank?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
I mean, I'll kick off here, [ph] but not 100% (20:41) understand the question but, clearly, as an ESG bank, we're
looking at a variety of frameworks [ph] such as the – (20:48) and the one which we're looking in particularly is the
WEF framework, World Economic Forum. Clearly, we've been a leader in TCFD disclosure. And we've made
substantial disclosures today in ESG report, in the TCFD report and the new ESG data pack. So, clearly, we are
working hard with all the relevant providers. But I think the one where we're moving forward for more generally is
the disclosures is the WEF framework. I'm not sure that answers the question but that's how we're currently
thinking about it.

Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thank you very much for taking my call. I have three questions. The first question is regarding DISCOs. Should
we think differently about the security that [ph] isn't from (21:43) the Hong Kong subsidiary as the LCR from this
entity is quite high and the security will not be MREL-eligible after January 2022?
My second question is a more broader question is regarding any impact because of the movement to Hong Kong
in terms of regulatory environment? And my third question is regarding ratings, if you guys have any comments or
thoughts about Moody's or Fitch downgrades?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Greg, do you want to take the first and third, and then I'll pick up the second one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, of course, of course. So, yes, I think to an extent, you should think about the Hong Kong and the UK
DISCOs separately and that they are issued by two different banks with different regulatory regimes and,
obviously, as you note, different liquidity positions. Now I'm not saying that we're necessarily going to look at them
differently or that one is more likely to be looked at as someone take out in the future or not. But I think it's worth
bearing in mind that they are under two very different regulatory regimes. And so, that's important to note.

HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
On the rating side of things, I think we're broadly comfortable with the ratings that we have. Obviously, we'd
always like them to be higher. There's not really much we can add beyond I think what the various rating agencies
have said publicly on the subject at this stage. And obviously, if you want to engage with them directly you can
feel free, but we're not going to put words in their mouth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the regulatory point, yeah, you may need to clarify the question. But I mean, there's nothing behind
what we've announced today or no comments around considering moving some members of his senior
management team to Hong Kong that's driven at all by regulation. Yeah, we are very much domiciled here in the
UK. Noel and I, for the foreseeable future, are based here in the UK. And there's nothing in today's
announcement that's driven by either a push factor from the PRA or a pull factor from the HKMA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tom Jenkins from Jefferies.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Managing Director, Jefferies
Thank you. Hey, hello. Thank you very much. Hello, everybody. I'm going to throw Greg under the bus one more
time on something we discussed, but it's an easy one I hope. And then I've got a couple of questions on the asset
sales, if I may.
Firstly, on the legacies, if you would let me – you're basically homeschooling several impatient and petulant
traders. And then the 31st of March has become quite a big date in the calendar for the PRA review submissions.
What sort of communication do you think – probably asking this a bit early, but do you have any plans to
communicate to the market what your submissions either looks like or rough ideas or are you going to wait until
sort of latter discussions with the PRA are concluded? And if that's the case, what sort of timeframe best guess,
and I promise I'm not going to hold you to have a best guess which you put on that before as market
communique.
And then, secondly, the asset sales. Really when I'm looking at the US, I'm just wondering what package you're
looking to sell. Is it just HSBC Bank USA N.A., the bulk of the retail business? Is it the intermediate HoldCo that
sits above the HSBC USA Inc., as a package? Or are you pretty much open to just selling parcels of loans if that's
all you can get a bid for?
And I guess the same thing goes for France really. Maybe looking more at the liability side, if – seeing as I
understand already separated retail from commercial lending to a larger extent there. Is it your anticipation at this
10


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
stage that the package you're looking to sell in France would include CCF bonds or not would be my questions.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, Greg, you can pick up the DISCO question and I can pick up the M&A questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, of course. Look, and generally speaking across the piece, obviously the March 31 deadline is the deadline
for us to submit our initial analyses and thoughts, how long that conversation goes on and very, very hard for us
to guide on. I think it will be a function of many things and obviously many different priorities.
So I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you there, Tom, and not give you again specifics. But, look, on the
market disclosure and things like that, look, it really depends on whether or not there's anything to tell you. And
that's kind of the first point. And if there is something to tell you then, of course, a very conscious that there may
be price-sensitive information in the mix here and if we need to make a disclosure, we'll make a disclosure, but
we're not kind of planning at this stage like a wholesale disclosure piece to be quite honest with you, it's more
around – if we do become party to anything we'll say something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Managing Director, Jefferies
Right. Okay. I figured as much. Just wanted to check.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And, look, I'm obviously somewhat constraint telling you what I can say about the M&A processes. But I
think if M&A processes do eventuate, there will be parts, France won't include the bonds and the US wouldn't be
a legal entity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Managing Director, Jefferies
It would not be a legal entity? So I was just cracking up a bit. Did you say...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
If that [indiscernible] (28:20) were to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Managing Director, Jefferies
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Okay. Interesting. Thank you very much.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. And good luck, Iain, and Greg, thanks very much for the package
that you send every quarter. It's very helpful. Two topics. One and I guess they're both kind of following on from
Tom. In the call earlier this morning, it was the idea of trapped capital in the US was brought up. How much
capital is trapped in the US? How would you plan on getting it out? Are there tax implications to that? And what's
changed? Because I imagine that you wanted to get some of this out for a while. And I guess, secondly, if you
could follow up on the comment you just made on legal entity, non-legal entity, the call broke up and I'm not really
sure what you were referring to? Thanks.

Well, on the second question, I think the question was, are we contemplating selling a legal entity in the US? And
the answer is no.

Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On trapped capital, this has been an issue that has persisted for a number of years. And today order of magnitude
– probably something in the order of about $5 billion of capital. You don't be it at the group level because
effectively we take on additional double leverage, what we'd like to do is pay the capital out and pay the double
leverage down. Yeah, we think it'll be a three, four-year journey for us of restructuring the US business and
getting the regulators comfortable that we've got a sustainably profitable business in the US and then through
several seek our cycles effectively getting approval to pay that capital up to the group.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
Hi, James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Leonard Hyde Q
Analyst, PGIM Ltd.
Hi, Ewen. Hi, everyone. Yeah. My question is slightly philosophical one about where you're going especially for us
as for the investment – as a developed market investment portfolio that my company runs. Now, 42% tangible
equity invested in Asia goes to 50%. Why stop at 50% given the ROE differential? Is that the sort of stock that
then makes you have to revisit domicile? Or is this to do with balance or rating agencies? I just want to
understand the thinking of any such benchmark. That's the first question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, I guess that was driven by a realistic medium- to longer-term target of shifting of capital. When you do the
math on it, that is a fairly material reallocation of capital from West to East over that period or growth
[indiscernible] (32:09) Yeah, I wouldn't fixate on 50%. But we are a global business today and a lot of the value in
Asia is driven by that global connectivity out of customers in the US and Europe and the UK. And therefore, there
will always, I think, for the foreseeable future, be material amounts of capital invested outside of Asia to support
and [ph] self reinforcing (32:39) with the Asian business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
And Jim, the timeframe here was three, four, five years depending on which particular target, and so clearly as we
go through that time period, we'll roll forward our plans to suit on the opportunities which you see at that particular
time. So, it's very much meant to be a pathway for the next few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Leonard Hyde Q
Analyst, PGIM Ltd.
Thanks, Ewen. Thanks, Richard. Just another question on these proposals regarding ESG that are more
particularly climate concerns that you're going to put to the AGM. I just want to understand, can you give us some
color on what's going to change? Is it going to be a formal refusal to do any more coal anywhere or any other
fossil fuels? Just want to understand, what would satisfy the some of the shareholders – ESG shareholders that
are being vocal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, I'll take that. Look, we've obviously received the ShareAction resolution and the resolution which was co-
filed by other institutional and retail shareholders. We are in positive discussions with that group. And clearly, we'll
have to put out our AGM notice some time towards the end of March. And in any event, there will be a climate
resolution filed. But clearly, as you saw with Barclays last year, there were actually two resolutions filed, but
ultimately, a number of investors would prefer there was just one resolution filed. So, we're still in that process,
Jim. So I'm afraid we can't be too specific.
But as the CEO, Noel Quinn, said today, clearly, there will be an element of a – the commitment to end the
finance of coal during a certain period of time. Clearly, we will also be making greater disclosures in terms of
sectors and sector pathways towards the net zero goal for 2050. But that's still very much work in progress and
we can obviously update you as and when or before we file the AGM notice in a few weeks' time.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
James Leonard Hyde Q
Analyst, PGIM Ltd.
Great. Thank you very much, Richard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our final question and your final question. And your final question for
today comes from the line of [ph] Dan Crew (34:57) from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi, there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thanks for the call. Just a quick one, my line broke up a little earlier. So, it's more of a clarification on issuance in
AT1. I assume that the refinancing includes both the $2 billion in AT1 coming and then the $1.8 billion in legacy
Tier 1. And then a kind of a follow-on from that. If the PRA asks you to remove some of the OpCo debt [ph] that's
going to your (35:30) Tier 2, would that change your issuance there?
And then I'm sure this was covered in the call earlier, but I had to drop off, but just trying to tie a few numbers on
your RWAs. I don't think I'm missing something in terms of increases for this year, so, it just looks like you simply
reached next year with pretty significant excess capital, I guess that's [ph] – hence, the talk of (35:57) buybacks or
is there something this year that I should take note of? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Greg or Iain, do you want to take the first part of that question and I'll pick up on RWAs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, [indiscernible] (36:16) on the AT1 what we said was that we would continue with the pattern of
replacing when appropriate. I don't really think we want to go beyond that. And on the Tier 2, we're not seeing any
particularly vigorous action from the PRA beyond the conversations we're having with them on the legacy
instruments. So, I don't think there would be anything happening this year that would force us to change the
issuance plans. I think that's what we are.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 23-Feb-2021
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Then on RWAs, on the equity call this morning, I mean, firstly, we haven't guided to capital ratios at the end of
[ph] Q1. (37:02) What I did say was the following. Firstly, we are probably more [ph] bullish than (37:10)
consensus on loan growth as you would expect us to be, but we are targeting mid-single-digit loan growth over
the next couple of years.
We have about $10 billion of RWA uplift and regulatory process this year and probably a combined $40 billion to
$50 billion over the period through 2023. We've got the RWA run-down program that's still ongoing. We did 52 in
the first year. We've got another 30 to do this year we think and the remainder the year after. And then, you'll
have your own views on credit rating migration.
So there could be a degree of that this year. For conservative reasons we'll assume that there is until there isn't.
So yeah, I think you're right that some of the equity analysts had assumed that that led to significant capital
surpluses. I did say this morning to the analysts sell-side that we weren't planning any buybacks on top of
dividends for this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Perfect. But there's nothing beyond that that I should be taking it, I mean that's all stuff I assumed there is
nothing coming out of the wood, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No. No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Well, look, thanks everyone for joining the call today. If you've got any follow-up questions, please follow up
with Greg Case, he's been on the call and your normal Investor Relations channels. But Greg, we appreciate you
taking the time to join the call today. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all
disconnect.
