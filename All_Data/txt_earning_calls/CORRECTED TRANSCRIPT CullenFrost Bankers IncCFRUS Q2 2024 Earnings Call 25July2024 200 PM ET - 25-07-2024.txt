At this time, I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review second quarter results for
Cullen/Frost. And I'm accompanied on the call by our CFO, Jerry Salinas; and Dan Geddes, who will offer
additional comments. Before I discuss the quarter, I'm sure you all saw our recent announcement of Jerry's
retirement as of the end of the year, after a brilliant career of almost 40 years at Frost.
Throughout that time, Jerry's been a part of virtually every major initiative that we've undertaken, and I've been
blessed to work with him during that entire time, and he will be missed. And rest assured, we plan on squeezing
as much work out of him as possible before his well-deserved retirement.
Jerry will be succeeded as CFO by Dan Geddes, who joins us on the call today. Dan has broad experience over
his 25 years at Frost, having served in the credit function, headed our commercial real estate division in Houston,
successfully executing our initial organic expansion strategy in Houston 1.0, and in leading the San Antonio
headquarters market as regional president, overseeing all our commercial activities there.
In the second quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $143.8 million or $2.21 a share, compared with earnings of $160.4
million or $2.47 per share reported in the same quarter last year. Our return on average assets and average
common equity in the second quarter were 1.18% and 17.08% respectively, and that compares with 1.3% and
19.36% for the same period last year. These results are due to our Frost Bankers and our continuing to execute
on our organic growth strategy.
Average deposits in the second quarter were $40.5 billion, down 1.2% from $41 billion in the second quarter last
year. As was the case in previous quarters, Cullen/Frost didn't utilize any federal home loan bank advances,
brokered deposits, or reciprocal deposit arrangements to build insured deposit percentage. Average loans grew
by more than 11% to $19.7 billion in the second quarter and that compared with $17.7 billion in the second
quarter of last year.
I'll now call on Dan Geddes to review the results from our expansion programs.

Dan Geddes
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I echo your sentiments about Jerry. His will be very big shoes to fill, and I look forward to
leveraging his institutional knowledge as we move through this transition period. We continue to see excellent
results in our organic growth program. For our Houston expansion, on a combined basis, what we call Houston
1.0 and Houston 2.0, we stand at 102% of deposit goal, 142% of loan goal, and 119% of our new household goal.
Breaking out the two, Houston 1.0 stands at 97% of deposit goal, having recently experienced similar commercial
deposit trends as the legacy company, 142% of loan goal, and 117% of new household goal.
Houston 2.0, which we expect to complete later this year or early in 2025, we stand at 205% of deposit goal,
142% of loan goal, and 158% of our new household goal. For the Dallas market expansion, we stand at 141% of
deposit goal, 187% of loan goal, and 178% of our new household goal. We have the first three locations in our
Austin expansion project open, with several more planned to open before the end of this year. At the end of the
second quarter, our overall expansion efforts have generated $2.2 billion in deposits, $1.5 billion in loans, and
added 50,783 new households.

As Phil and Jerry have mentioned in the past, for perspective, the largest acquisition in our history was a
company with $1.4 billion in deposits. In addition, the successes of the earlier expansion projects basically are
funding the current expansion. We expect the Houston expansion to fund the Dallas and Houston expansions in
2025, with 2026 being the year the three expansion efforts are accreted to earnings. Since we began the
expansion five years ago, we have added 58 locations to our branch network in the expansion regions, or about
one new location every month for the last five years. Those 58 locations now represent 30% of our entire branch
network across Texas.
The expansion branches are growing at an impressive rate and becoming a more meaningful part of Cullen/Frost.
For the second quarter, growth in average loans and deposits in the expansion branches were up an
unannualized 9% linked quarter, and both average loans and deposits were up 47% year-over-year. The
expansion now represents 7.6% of total loans and 5.4% of total deposits for our entire company. For perspective,
at the same time last year, the expansion represented 5.8% of loans and 3.6% of deposits of our company.
For the respective regions of Houston and Dallas, the expansion represents 23% of Houston's loans and 21% of
deposits. For Dallas, the expansion is already at 14% of loans and 14% of deposits.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Phil.

Thanks, Dan. In our consumer bank, we continue to see excellent growth across the board. Average balances in
consumer loans were up more than 22% or $571 million year-over-year. This excellent loan growth was driven by
record consumer real estate lending, which is comprised of both second-lien home equity loans as well as our
new mortgage products. Mortgage loan fundings were $76 million in the quarter, which is over three times our first
quarter fundings. So, we're gaining momentum as this product matures. At quarter-end, our mortgage portfolio
stood at $132.4 million. And I should also mention how proud we are that CNN underscored, recently rated Frost
as the best mortgage lender in Texas. This is going to be a great asset class for us.
Average balances in consumer deposits have returned to positive growth territory, with the year-over-year
increase of 1.4% or $253 million. Finally, we continue to see high-quality industry-leading checking household
growth of 5.8%. We do not offer any of the cash incentives to become a customer that have become so
commonplace in the industry because people are choosing Frost based on our reputation for outstanding service,
which has been recognized by J.D. Power 15 years in a row. Our investments in our organic expansions in
Houston, Dallas, and Austin, as well as our investments in marketing, are driving these stellar results in our
consumer bank and we expect this to continue.
Looking at our commercial business, on a linked-quarter basis, average loan balances increased an annualized
rate of 8.7% for C&I and 10% for CRE. In the second quarter, we brought in 977 new commercial relationships,
an increase of 19% on a linked-quarter basis, which represented the second-highest quarterly increase ever. This
coincided with us achieving our second-highest level of quarterly calling activity within 1% of the record high that
we set in the first quarter.
New loan commitments totaled $1.98 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 58% compared with the first
quarter, and an increase of 29% compared to the second quarter last year. The split of commitments booked in
the second quarter was about 54% larger â€“ was about 54% for larger credits and 46% for core credit. So, good
balance there. Credit is good by historical standards, with net charge-offs and non-accrual loans both at healthy

levels. We continue to see some normalization in credit terms of risk rating migrations in the portfolio, as we come
off historic lows in problem loans. But we've not experienced higher credit losses as our borrowers, and the Texas
economy overall has so far proven to be resilient. Net charge-offs for the first quarter are $9.7 million compared to
$7.4 million and $9.8 million a year ago.
Annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter represented 19 basis points of period-end loans. Non-
performing assets totaled $75 million at the end of the second quarter, compared with $72 million last quarter and
$69 million a year ago. The quarter-end figure represents just 38 basis points of period-end loans and 15 basis
points of total assets.
Problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 or higher, some refer this as â€“ to this as OAM â€“ OAEM loans,
totaled $986 million at the end of the second quarter. That's up from $810 million at the end of the first quarter and
$442 million this time last year. The growth in the quarter was mainly due to a few larger C&I credits, mostly in the
classified substandard category. About 22% of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real
estate, slightly less than 50% are related to C&I credits, with most of the rest in owner-occupied real estate loans,
which are closely related to C&I loans.
Regarding commercial real estate lending, our overall portfolio remains stable, with steady operating performance
across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loans-to-value. Within this category, what
we would consider to be the major categories of investor CRE, office, multi-family, retail, and industrial as
examples totaled $4.1 billion or 46% of CRE loans outstanding. Our investor CRE portfolio has held up well with
the average performance metrics stable to slightly improved quarter-over-quarter, exhibiting an overall average
loan-to-value at underwriting of about 52% and average weighted debt service coverage ratio of about 1.55.
The investor office portfolio, specifically, had a balance of $981 million at quarter-end, and that portfolio exhibited
an average loan-to-value of 52% healthy occupancy levels, and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.57,
which is slightly improved for the third consecutive quarter. Our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to
be based on the character and expertise of our borrowers and sponsors and the predominantly Class A nature of
our office building projects.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jerry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Before I begin with my prepared remarks about the quarter, I did want to say that as I head into
these last few months of my career here at Frost, I want to say that I am deeply honored and humbled to have
had the opportunity to work for such a remarkable company with our outstanding culture for over 38 years, all of
which I've spent working for Phil. I feel truly blessed to have had this opportunity, including serving as CFO for the
past 10 years. While I look forward to the next chapter, I will truly miss my incredible teammates who have made
this journey so special. I know that Dan will do an outstanding job in his new role as CFO.
Looking at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was 3.54%, up 6
basis points from the 3.48% reported last quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes of loans,
along with higher yields on loans and investment securities. These positives were partially offset by higher costs
of interest-bearing deposits, and to a lesser extent, lower balances at the Fed compared to the first quarter.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $18.6 billion during the second quarter,
down $696 million from the first quarter. During the second quarter, investment purchases totaled $337 million,
5

with $235 million of that being Agency MBS securities yielding 5.69%, and $102 million in municipals with a
taxable-equivalent yield of 5.50%. The net unrealized loss on the available-for-sale portfolio, at the end of the
quarter, was $1.63 billion, an increase of $42 million from the $1.59 billion reported at the end of the first quarter.
The taxable-equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the second quarter was 3.38%, up 6 basis points
from the first quarter.
The taxable portfolio, which averaged $12 billion, down approximately $489 million from the prior quarter, had a
yield of 2.92%, up 9 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax-exempt municipal portfolio averaged $6.6 billion
during the second quarter, down $207 million from the first quarter and had a taxable-equivalent yield of 4.30%,
up 3 basis points from the prior quarter. At the end of the second quarter, approximately 71% of the municipal
portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second
quarter was 5.5 years, flat with the first quarter.
Looking at deposits, on a linked-quarter basis, average total deposits of $40.5 billion were down $215 million or
0.5% from the previous quarter. We did continue to see a mix shift during the second quarter, as the average non-
interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $298 million or 2.1%, while interest-bearing deposits increased $83
million or 0.3% when compared to the previous quarter. Based on second-quarter average balances, non-interest-
bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were at 33.8%, compared to 34.3% in the first quarter. The
cost of interest-bearing deposits in the second quarter was 2.39%, up 5 basis points from the 2.34% in the first
quarter.
Looking at July, month-to-date averages for total deposits through yesterday, they're down about $140 million
from our second quarter average of $40.5 billion with interest-bearing being down $60 million and non-interest-
bearing down $80 million month-to-date. Customer repos for the second quarter averaged $3.8 billion, basically
flat with the first quarter. The cost of customer repos for the quarter was 3.75%, down 1 basis point from the first
quarter. The month-to-date July average balance for customer repos was down approximately $120 million from
the second-quarter average.
Looking at non-interest income and expense on a linked-quarter basis, I'll just point out a couple of items.
Insurance commissions and fees were down $4.4 million or 23.9%. As I've mentioned in previous quarters,
property and casualty and benefit company bonuses are typically received in the first quarter. These bonuses
contributed about $3.1 million of the decrease when compared to the first quarter.
In terms of non-interest expenses on a linked-quarter basis, benefits expense was down $7.2 million or almost
20%, impacted by lower payroll taxes and 401(k) expenses related to annual bonuses paid during the first
quarter. Deposit insurance was down $6.3 million, as we recognized $1.2 million in special FDIC assessments in
the second quarter, compared to $7.7 million related to the special assessment in the first quarter. Looking at
capital, during the second quarter, we did buy back $30 million of our stock. That translates into a little over
300,000 shares at an average price of $99.50.
Regarding our guidance for full-year 2024, our current projections include two 25-basis-point cuts for the Fed
funds rate over the remainder of 2024, with one cut in September and another one in November. That is
consistent with our previous guidance. Looking at loans, on a year-to-date average basis, loans are up 10.8%
compared to last year-to-date. We now expect full-year average loan growth in the range of high single digits to
low double digits, a little higher than our previous guidance.
Looking at deposits, the current year-to-date average is down 3% compared to last year-to-date. We now expect
full-year average deposits to be flat-to-down 2%. That is down from our previous guidance of flat to growth of 2%.

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
We expect net interest income growth in the range of 2% to 3%. The upper end of our guidance is down from our
previous guidance of growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The net interest margin percentage is still expected to
trend slightly upward each quarter for the remainder of the year.
Based on year-to-date growth and current projections, we are projecting growth in non-interest income in the
range of 2% to 3%, up from our previous guidance of flat to up 1%. Based on year-to-date results and current
projections, we're projecting non-interest expense growth in the range of 6% to 7% on a reported basis. That is
down from the 6% to 8% previous guidance. I will say, however, that we continue to be focused on bringing that
expense growth percentage down.
Regarding net charge-offs, we still expect those to go up to a more normalized historical level of 25 basis points to
30 basis points of average loans. And regarding taxes, our effective tax rate for the full-year 2023 was 16.1%, and
we continue to currently expect a flat to slightly higher effective rate in 2024.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
No, it wasn't line utilization, Steve. It was growth. I don't know if I â€“ I didn't think of it in terms of share gains, but I
guess we did do pretty well relative to the market. But it was just good activity. It was mainly â€“ if you look at new
commitments that we had, which I realize are not balances but they're the basis of those balances, new
commitments for the quarter were up strongly. About 80% of it was from C&I and energy. We had a really good
quarter on energy this time, some really well-underwritten deals, good structures, and good relationships.
So, it was just good activity. Our people are working hard. And I think I said we had our second-highest quarter of
calls in the second quarter and things are just going well, to be honest.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And Phil, on the commercial real estate side, you guys had good growth there. It's an area where many
peers continue to pull away from. Are you just being opportunistic, stepping in where others are stepping back?
And should that be a continued driver of loan growth in the back half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I think, the balanced growth in C&I is really driven mainly by projects that have been put in place in the past,
and you're seeing those fund up. I don't see that being a developing driver of balanced growth going forward. I
mean, there will be some, and we are being opportunistic in a number of different areas. I mean, you may think
I'm crazy, but we did an office building loan in San Antonio in the quarter. And it's great sponsor, great project,
great metrics, and â€“ et cetera. So, it was mainly though about great people we wanted to bank and had
relationships with. So, we continue to bank people not things, and we are taking advantage of business as it
presents itself. And that's what we want to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then just finally, I want to ask you about your deposit strategy, if you will, because when
the Fed started raising rates, I remember you guys were one of the first banks that started raising deposit rates for
your customers. I think, on the call, you said you were going to share the benefit with them, and that was while
many peers were not raising rates. And then there was a big lag for the industry, which you guys really didn't see.
But with the Fed looking like they're about to cut now, what's your strategy? Do you take that benefit back more
quickly? Do you see what the competitive environment does first? Like how are you thinking about it at this stage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, Steven, you're exactly right with the history there. Our current expectation is that, we would move in the same
manner that we went up. We would kind of move back down in that same sort of manner. Obviously, I always give
that caveat, we'll continue to look at what competitors are doing. But we were quick to go up and expect that we'd
be able to make those same sort of decreases on the way down.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. On the NII guide, appreciate it, all the color on your assumptions for rate cuts there. I
think, last quarter, you mentioned you get roughly $1.4 million in a hit on a monthly basis for each 25-basis-point
rate cut. Correct me if that's wrong. But is that about the same today? And then just given what you just said in
terms of moving deposit costs down in a similar pace as the increase on the way up, that's how you're thinking
about it from the first cut or is there a little delay? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. No, right from the first cut is what we're currently thinking. But I'll continue to say â€“ we'll continue â€“ we'll
look at what the market is doing, but our current thought process is we will move immediately. As far as what the
cost of the â€“ or the benefit, if you will, or the cost of the â€“ the hike or cut, it is probably a little bit higher. And a lot
of that is going to be dependent on how much liquidity we have so that can move. Today, I'd probably tell you, if
you said it was $1.4 million, I'd tell you, it might be in the range of $1.5 million to $1.6 million, so not too far
different, but it's really going to be dependent on how much liquidity we have at the Fed.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yes. Got it. All right. And then just following on the loan growth discussion, it sounded like you saw a decent
amount of strength in C&I. You mentioned energy. Are there any other areas where you're seeing particular bright
spots there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I wouldn't say there's anything that stands out. The energy, I think, was most unusual in terms of its growth
during the quarter. But no, I think it's just been good growth overall. We've been seeing lots of good opportunities
and taking advantage of them.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Yeah. Okay. And on the credit side, you talked about the problem loan increase. Some of that, it sounded like was
on the C&I front. Any patterns there or any color to some â€“ on the industries where you saw a little bit of
weakness?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I would say it was driven by two industries, one that we've â€“ and I've talked about them both really over the
last few quarters is we've had the interest rate increases. It would be in â€“ it would be in contractors. There were a
couple of large contractors that we moved to the classified position based on their situation. And then we've had a
couple of automobile dealers, one was a used car dealer, one was a new car dealer in the South Texas area. And
car dealers have been pressed by â€“ certainly, the used car dealers have been pressed by the increase in interest
rates, higher floorplan cost. If they're financing with buy here, pay here, their credit losses have been higher.
They've had a â€“ sort of had a perfect storm, and they've had some dislocations in that industry. And we've talked
about those over the last several quarters. The contractors are the ones that we would like to believe have a path
forward in the not-too-distant future, but we'll just have to see. But it is â€“ it's not commercial real estate. I will say
there were a couple of multi-family deals that we did move to risk grade 10. And really, that was because they had
come upon their covenant â€“ covenants and their loan agreements.
It had been introduced at that time in that agreement after, say, about a three-year period, and they were below
their covenants. And they are working to move those back, either through operations of the property, or through a
sale, or refinancing of it. And we think those would both be just fine. But because of the situation with the
covenant, we'd like to move that to risk grade 10. And I think we'll see more go into that. I think we'll see some of
these flow out, and we'll see new ones go in, but I'm really not concerned with the multi-family situation and the
debt service covenant ratios that might cause them to be in risk grade 10 at any one point in time.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, I guess first, Jerry and Dan, congratulations to each of you on the retirement and the new role. I know you
have a few months. And I'm glad Phil is going to extract the last bit out of you, Jerry. So â€“ but maybe I think I
heard this earlier. Just big-picture question, I think when you shared the stats about the new branches â€“ and it
sounded like, as we fast forward to 2026, all three expansion sort of markets would be breakeven.
So, two questions on that. One, what's the drag to earnings or returns today because of this investment spend?
And I'm just trying to get to what operating leverage that we should expect, as we think about ROA, ROE once we
get to 2026? And is â€“ and then, is there more appetite or need to add a similar number of branches over the next
five years once this is done?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, the â€“ let me answer the second part. This is our strategy. And I hope that there'll continue to be really
good opportunities in the State of Texas for us to continue to expand. We expect that they are. We're doing some
work now on identifying those places and trying to see where the puck is going to go, and not get behind that. In
2026, I think what â€“ as Dan said, and as Jerry had said before, we expect â€“ it's basically breakeven now. We're
going to be adding on several locations in Austin, so I think we'll be â€“ basically breakeven next year. And other
things equal, that's when you'd see some significant accretion, I think, from that program, and continuing to move
forward from there.
And â€“ but we've got to remember that â€“ and that's a couple of years from now, but we got to remember that if we
do have opportunities to expand into very attractive markets, we're going to do it. Because as I said many times,
this strategy is durable, and it is scalable, and it's been very successful, and we're building great long-term value
here.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And maybe, I guess Jerry, for you, just around NII, I think I heard you expect NIM to move higher third and
fourth quarter. Just as we think about rate cuts in the world where we get a series of rate cuts, one, does that
continue, or are there actions that you may take outside of deposits on the asset side at some point to change the
complexion of the balance sheet, or there's no such sort of plan to do anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And the â€“ as I mentioned, what our rate scenario is, we do have two rate cuts in there. And don't forget, I
did say slightly higher in the next couple of quarters. So, we're not talking about the sort of growth that we had in
between the first and second quarter, which really was a nice-sized growth. I think, for us, the opportunities are
really, as we talked about before, investment opportunities coming out of that portfolio, especially this year as we
talk about the latter half of the year. I think we talked about the fact that we've got â€“ I think it's like $500 million just
in the fourth quarter, that's under 1%, right, at 96 basis points. So, we'll see some uptick there.
From a fixed loan standpoint, we â€“ the size of the portfolio that we have that our bullet sort of fixed rate loans are
probably not as significant. But if you throw in amortizing fixed rate loans, you probably get proceeds about â€“ of
11


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
about $500 million through the rest of the year, and then north of $1 billion next year. So, we'll have opportunities
there as well to reprice those at even higher rates than where we would be even if the rate environment was
lower. So, I think we do have those sorts of opportunities going forward.
We'll continue to see what we do on the asset side. We continue â€“ we're always looking at that. But right now, I
think those and the ability to price down on the deposit side are probably things that we're focusing on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one quick follow-up. Is it safe for us, given how you've talked about the investment spend, how
expense growth is tracking this year, that as we look into next year, most likely that expense growth decelerates
as opposed to accelerates compared to 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I â€“ from an expense growth standpoint, I mean, I think that's what we've been saying, right, is that the plan would
be that the expense growth would not be at the same level of the growth that we had projected. What I will say is
that we're running a pretty tight ship right now. We're doing a lot of things that we need to do.
We guided down on that expense growth, and Dan's going to be the new sheriff in town. But â€“ so, we're still trying
to get the growth down this year. But there will be some things that we have to do that we know we have to do.
So, I'd said before, I don't expect that our growth rate will be back in that 3% to 4% to 5%. I still â€“ I still think that
we're probably talking about growth in the higher single digits, and that's all going to be refined and would be
discussed at the at the January call.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. If I could just follow up on expenses, I hear you that you've lowered the top end of the
range for expenses for this year, but it does imply a pretty steep ramp in the second half of the year. And that's on
top of core expenses coming down this quarter, if I exclude FDIC. So, can you just talk about what type of
expense initiatives you have in the second half of this year that's driving that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. One of the things that we have every year in the fourth quarter are restricted stock awards. And there's
quite a few of them that â€“ by their nature, that vets immediately, some of them are age-based, and give us some
of those awards. You'll see that expense growth. And if you look at our historical trends on expenses, you'll see
that that the fourth quarter goes up pretty significantly. That's the main driver that comes to mind.
12


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Again, we're continuing to put these initiatives in place. So, our run rate naturally is growing. But as I said, we are
looking and trying to ensure that if we do â€“ if we are approving expenses that are â€“ there are things that we really
absolutely need to do. But I think what you're looking at is primarily driven by increases in compensation
associated with true-ups of incentive plans, and then the issuance of the restricted stock is probably the biggest
piece of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then can I just ask a big-picture question? If I think about the branch expansion, it's really starting to
pay some strong dividends, and you've got this long runway for growth, as you open up more branches. Are there
opportunities maybe to close some underperforming branches or consolidate branches that are kind of close to
one another to kind of help manage the expense and offset some of these costs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Peter, I think there are in a number of cases. And we are closing all the locations in these markets, and we're
moving them to new locations. I don't know that we count those in the expansion numbers, but that is happening.
And so, rest assured, we are looking at locations that are underperforming and that we don't need.
I think we've had good luck to not have a lot of those because, frankly, we were under-branched, if you look at the
various competitors in the state. So, we didn't have a lot to make up there, backfill as far as closures go. So yeah,
we do that. And it's not unusual for us to close an old one and get it in a new location that we think has better
growth prospects.

Manan Gosalia Q

I wanted to come back to the loan and deposit guide. So, if loans up high single to low double digits, deposits flat-
to-down 2%, does cash come down, or what makes up the difference? I ask because you highlighted your plan to
cut deposit rates as Fed rates come down. But loan growth feels really strong here, so just trying to see where the
offset is and what the appetite is to allow deposits to run down a little if you need to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. No real appetite to run down deposits. We really are a relationship bank. We're really focused on deposits.
And with a loan-to-deposit ratio at 50%, loan growth at 12% really doesn't scare me. I mean we're â€“ as Phil said,
we're going after great opportunities, and we're glad that we have those opportunities to be growing today.
The thing that will probably be more a handle that we can move, if you will, would be the investment portfolio
purchases. We had started the year, I think, at $1.6 billion is what we thought we would purchase. Last quarter, I
said we brought that down to $1.2 billion. We're probably closer to $900 million right now. And we bought maybe
$0.5 billion of that year-to-date. And so, just have projected maybe another $400,000 to make.
So, at this point, that's really the mechanism that we've used in that scenario, where deposits might be a little bit
softer. And we really don't â€“ we â€“ our projections are pretty light in the second half. We do see some growth and
those could obviously be better. But we just really don't feel any conviction at this point and felt like that's the right
thing to do.
And so, from an investment portfolio standpoint, that's the one that is really for â€“ easy for us right now, to just put
the brakes on. Given where rates are today, if we went out and invested, in some cases, we might earn a little bit
less than where we're at today. I think the purchases that we made were slightly better, but that's really what we
would move more than anything else, is what we would do in the investment portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think Jerry is right on that. And your question really, I think, brings up something that we need to keep in mind,
and it is that our loan growth is good, but our â€“ what it really is, is relationship growth because we don't make any
loans that we don't get the deposit relationship. And so, in this environment, you've got good loan growth here,
but you're getting those deposit relationships underneath that because of where rates are today and the efficiency
that businesses are employing with their deposits and their cash, you're not seeing as much deposits following on,
as I think we will see in the future as these things normalize and as the rates normalize. So, while you may not
see the deposit growth now, I'm encouraged that you'll see it in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And just something to add to that is, when we're out in the marketplace, having the ability to provide capital
in this market puts us at a competitive advantage. And looking at the impact of new relationships and our year-to-
date loan balance growth, 38% of that is from new relationships. And we were able to get $249 million in new
relationship deposits. And a lot of that is because we can â€“ our pencils aren't down. We are open for business.
And so, we're able to bring in new relationships with these loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, Dan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. That's great color. Maybe the second part of the question is, peers are saying that they expect a pretty
sizable pickup in loan growth as rates come down. Is that something you expect as well? I mean, loans already
14


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
going â€“ growing 11% year-on-year for the first six months. Could you see an acceleration from here as rates
come down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, not necessarily. I don't think we're thinking of it that way. I mean, what we're doing is we're making calls, we're
developing relationships. And I don't think it would move us one way or another. I think what we might see is, if we
get some clarity in the election, the political process, it's clear to me that â€“ just from talking from our loan officers,
relationship managers, that there are a number of companies that are as is typical. They're waiting to see which
way the political winds blow. And based upon what they see, it'll give some visibility in terms of what kind of â€“
primarily what kind of regulation they might see.
And once that clears up, and they understand where they are, I think you'll see businesses that might be holding
off today move forward. At least that's what we've heard from a lot of our people. So, I have heard less talk about
once rates go down than I've heard about once the environment gets more clarity with regard to what kind of
administration we might have, making the regulatory decisions.

Hey, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, just following up on the last line of questioning, and just could you speak broadly as far as what you're seeing
from a competitive standpoint in your markets? I remember, the last call you mentioned how some lenders were
kind of getting back in the game. But could you speak as far as what you're seeing today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it's getting more competitive. I think where we had â€“ let's take commercial real estate, I think we're seeing
people move back in. I think we were hopeful that you'd see more people requiring guarantees. I think there are a
lot of players that are not doing that. And so, I think what we're seeing it slide a little bit back to where it was
15


Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2024
before. But as some people that have been out of the market, pencils down, as they say, for coming back in,
you're seeing some more competition.
I think we're seeing maybe in the real estate side, a little more competition from the smaller banks. Just an
observation. But that's kind of what we're seeing. Dan, any thoughts on here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's â€“ I see kind of this second half, we had a really strong second quarter in terms of closings. And with what Phil
mentioned about just the uncertainty in the environment, I see that it's being a little slower just in looking at our
weighted pipeline. But in terms of competition from the other banks and lenders in the marketplace, we certainly
kind of see it from the community banks in the markets that we're in, we'll see it from some regionals, or some
regionals that decide to get into our markets. And so, we're seeing some new players who are coming into our
markets in over the last kind of six months to a year. So, I could see the competition picking up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And how has that impacted pricing discipline, right? I know you've increased your loan growth, so I
assume you're getting the right pricing, but has there been any pressure there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's always pricing pressure. But actually, if you look at the deals that we've lost, about three-
quarters of the deals that we've lost have been due to structure. And that's the thing that concerns us most. With
our cost of deposits and our cost of funding, I'd argue that we're one of the low-cost producers in the marketplace,
as regards the cost of funding. And therefore, we can be very competitive on pricing.
And remember, we're booking or we are banking relationships first. And so, if someone passes the test to be a
Frost customer, and they're willing to live within our structures, [ph] we're willing to lose (00:49:18) that after all
that development for a few basis points. So, we'll be very competitive on price, but structure's a different deal.
We're â€“ we have been and will be disciplined as it relates to structure. And so, that's where we're seeing more of
our losses.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One more follow-up to the margin. Just as we think about the NII guide towards â€“ for the year, do you think â€“ just
a little bit of follow-up we've already answered, but do you think you'll continue to see NIM expansion through the
back half of the year kind of equal to the pace we've seen? Or does that expansion start to moderate in the back
half of the year, but maybe the average earning asset growth kind of moderates, or maybe even grows a little bit?
How do we think about the balance between those two things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. No, I think the rate of growth would be quicker in the â€“ or higher in the first half of the year and slower in the
second half of the year. Yeah, we're â€“ again, we're...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
But still an upward trending margin, you think?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q

And then [indiscernible] (00:50:43) as we start to price in cuts in the back half of the year, as we â€“ or as we get

see Fed cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Again, it depends on timing. But I think based on our current assumptions, starting in September, that's
really what my guidance was based on. So, we still see some upticks. Again, that's â€“ that kind of slows down the
growth. But we do continue to see that sort of growth projected out through the rest of this year.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Is it still NIM expansion, but just less if we get cuts, and just to that kind of $1.5 million that you were talking
about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. Yeah. I mean that's the thing. We do â€“ like I said, we do have some investments, as I mentioned, and a big
part of it is the $500 million. So, if you're reinvesting stuff, that $500 million in treasuries is â€“ it is 96 bps. But even
the rest of the fundings are probably in the three handles on them at or high-2s. And so, all those will provide you
with some upside. And again, given what happens with the fixed-rate loans that reprice, we'll have some pickup
there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then, is there any color on just the new growth, the new loans you're putting on, relative to new deposits
you're putting on, what would you say those two rates are? The new loan yields and the new deposit cost today
that spread?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, the new deposit costs are going to be the same, right. They're really going to mirror whatever is going on in
the existing portfolio. We do very minimal exception pricing on the loans â€“ excuse me, on the deposit side. So,
you have some, but you're not going to have a lot of that. And as far as the back book, and we're probably right
now in the weighted average rate of, say, a 6.70 or something in that range is the back book, and current stuff
going on north of 8.

Jon Arfstrom Q

A little bit of cleanup here. But Phil, you talked about the mortgage business opportunity earlier in the call, and it
looks like those volumes have really picked up. Can you talk a little bit about the driver of that and where this can
all go? And when it shows up in a material way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jon, I go back to when we announced that effort actually over a year ago, and I believe we said we expected that
the mortgage book could be in excess of the consumer book that we had at that time, and so over a five-year
period. So, I don't think we have come off of that. And it's just â€“ it's a new thing. And we're getting our people
used to making recommendations on it. You're hitting the realtor community, understanding what it is, and we've
got â€“ we've just got great service. And I think it's just going to be a great asset class for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A

Jon Arfstrom Q

Okay. Question for maybe Phil or Dan. What is the significance of the plan? When you talk about the performance
of the new branches, it looks like all are either on plan or ahead of plan. But as an outsider, what does that really
mean? And what's the benchmark that we can use there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, what we â€“ when we started, Jon, you might recall, we started this strategy, and we looked at the
performance of the 40 branches that we had opened up over the last eight years prior to that time. And we said
that â€“ we looked at the average of that, and we said if we can do the average of that in the markets that we're
going to be in, we felt like we would have a really successful strategy for our shareholders. And so, that's what we
based it on. And then, we began measuring what our performance was versus that. We kept it fairly consistent.
Although I know that we've changed that some, Dan, you might talk about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan Geddes A
Incoming Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. We've â€“ I mean, we've tweaked it with Dallas. We learned a lot from Houston 1.0. And as much as it pains
me, Dallas is outperforming Houston at the same time period that it goes back to our blue book of continuous
improvement. And so, we learned what work could we do better, and Dallas is just doing a great job, as you can
see from their performance. And so, I would expect the same from Austin as well.

But we want to keep it somewhat consistent because we want to be able to compare just like Dan did. And he
was â€“ he's kind of only half-joking that Dallas is outperforming Houston. So, that makes him mad. But the â€“ but
we can have a consistent comparison in these markets. And I think that that's helpful to us. And it's â€“ we'll try and
keep it that way. Again, making adjustments for the markets that we're in, but we'll sort of keep it fairly consistent.
