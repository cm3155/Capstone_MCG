Now, I will turn the call over to Robert Hill, Executive Chairman.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning and thank you for your interest in SouthState. We are pleased to report our performance for the
third quarter. The performance was solid and the team made nice progress in each of our three areas of focus,
soundness, profitability and growth. We knew going into 2021 that this would be a year of significant change for
the company, building the foundation for a larger bank which included new technology and talent. These are
difficult changes and take time to digest, but this year has positioned us well for the future.
As an investor, it's hard to see the benefits in the short-term of an MOE, but the third quarter was a quarter that
provided a glimpse into the future opportunities for SouthState. Just as 2021 was a year of change, 2022 will be a
year of focusing on ourselves. The internal opportunities for growth, efficiency, advancing talent, technology and
building our culture are real and meaningful. We have great markets, a strong and growing team and so many
opportunities to make our company better. We look forward to reporting to you the progress we make in these
areas over the next year.
I'll now turn the call over to John.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thank you, Robert. Good morning, everybody. I hope you and your families are doing well. Throughout the
pandemic, we've talked about the population migration to the Southeast, the rapid reopening of our markets and
our growing loan pipelines. Not surprising, loan production increased significantly last spring following the vaccine
rollout, and that trend continued in the third quarter. In fact, loan production of $2.6 billion in the third quarter is a
record for us and is 72% higher than a year ago.
Our previous guidance was for mid-single-digit loan growth in the second half of this year, and we exceeded that
guidance in the third quarter with 10% annualized loan growth. Most of the growth was in C&I loans, which has
been the trend over the last few quarters. A portion of the C&I loan growth this quarter was associated with
seasonal businesses that support hurricane cleanup efforts for large power companies, so some of this quarter's
growth is seasonal and temporary.
Our cash position at 14% of our balance sheet is materially higher than our peers, and we're working to deploy
that excess cash as interest rates drift upwards. Securities increased by over $700 million last quarter and loans
increased by $573 million, excluding PPP. So, we deployed about $1.3 billion of our surplus cash into earning
assets. The growth of loans and rising rates resulted in our core net interest income growing by $5.8 million in the
quarter. We were encouraged by the Fed's commentary a few weeks ago about tapering their asset purchases,
and we believe that SouthState is in a unique position to benefit from rising rates over the next year.
Asset quality continues to be a non-event, with net charge-offs of 0 basis points during the quarter. As a result, we
released $38.9 million in reserves. After the reserve release, our adjusted earnings per share landed at $1.94 and
our return on tangible common equity was 18.7%. Doug is here with us and will comment later in the call on
another strong quarter at Atlantic Capital. They had 12% loan growth. I do want to report that we received
regulatory approval for the acquisition from the OCC and we are now awaiting Federal Reserve approval. The
shareholder vote is scheduled for November 16, so we're hopeful for a close in the first quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
We originally thought there was a chance we could convert the computer systems in the first quarter, but it looks
more likely in the second quarter, so that will push back the cost savings by about 90 days. We've accomplished a
lot strategically in the last two years with the MOE in 2020 and the opportunity with Atlantic Capital in 2021. As we
look ahead, it only makes sense that 2022 will be a year that we are internally focused rather than focused on
bank M&A. We're going to be focused on continuing our recruiting and our organic loan growth, refining our
processes and new technology and improving our profitability. As we saw in this quarter's results, 10% loan
growth with an improvement in the expense base and a little lift in interest rates can have a powerful
compounding effect in the quarters ahead.
I'll turn it over to Will now to provide further details on the quarter.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll cover some highlights on margin, non-interest income and non-interest expense, as well as
credit and the provision for credit losses. As shown on slide 11, net interest income for the quarter totaled $260
million. Core net interest income excluding all accretion, including PPP accretion, improved by $5.8 million from
Q2, $2.5 million of which was due to an additional day account and the remainder of which was due to stronger
net interest income per day.
Our loan growth and continued improvement in deposit funding costs helped improve our core net interest
income. Our net interest margin was 2.86% for Q3 flat with Q2. Loan yields of 4.07% were up slightly from Q2, but
loan yields, excluding PPP loans were down 10 basis points to 3.91%. New loan yields in Q3 were 3.18%, down
24 basis points from Q2. As a reminder and as illustrated on slide 16, the average 10-year treasury yield was
down 26 basis points in Q3 versus Q2.
Overall, cost of funds declined 4 basis points to 13 basis points. Core loan growth, excluding PPP loans, was
$571 million. Our C&I loans grew by $336 million, followed by owner occupied CRE at $93 million, and
construction, which includes consumer construction perm mortgages at $85 million. Single family residential,
excluding construction perm loans declined by $14 million in the quarter.
Our commercial pipeline remains strong at $4.7 billion at quarter end. As you'll note on slide 12, we had another
good quarter of loan production. On the deposit side, our cost of total deposits declined 3 basis points to 9 basis
points, and total deposits grew over $318 million after a $344 million reduction in CDs. We continue to deploy
some of the excess cash into both loan growth and securities, with securities growing by $615 million versus Q2
balances.
As you can see on slide 17, investments moved to 15.7% of assets, and our fed fund sole balances were 13.9%
of assets and we remain below peers and securities to assets and well above peers in cash to assets, so we
continue to have extensive dry powder. Additionally, you'll note our asset sensitive profile and low historical
deposit beta illustrated on slide 18 and 19.
Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income of $87 million was up $8 million from Q2. As highlighted on
slide 13, mortgage banking income improved by $5.5 million from last quarter's $10.1 million but remains well
below last year's record third quarter. Production was $1.3 billion, with purchase loan representing 70% of total
volume. We sold 54% of our volume in the secondary market, down 3% from Q2. After last year's record margins
gain on sale margins have returned to levels more consistent with historical levels with a slight improvement from
Q2.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Turning to slide 14, correspondent income was $25.2 million down slightly from Q2's $25.9 million. Deposit fee
income also increased $2.2 million, some of which is attributable to fee waivers last quarter associated with our
core system conversion. Our non-interest expense, total NIE excluding merger related expenses was $214.7
million, down approximately $4 million from Q2, in spite of a loss on the sale of a piece of acquired ORE due to a
zoning issue and higher health insurance expenses due to claims activity. Q3 also reflects a full quarter of merit
increases, which were effective July 1. Also, as John referenced, we've refined our conversion date for Atlantic
Capital and is now expected to occur in the second quarter of 2022 rather than Q1. So with respect to NIE and
2022 modeling, this will slightly push back much of our cost stabilization by a few months.
I'll now discuss credit. With respect to CECL and the allowance, improvements and economic projections
impacting our loss drivers led to another reduction in the allowance for credit losses. These improved economic
forecasts cause us to record a negative provision for loan losses of $38.9 million. For this quarter's weightings of
Moody's economic scenarios in our CECL modeling, we reviewed the underlying assumptions in the Moody's
baseline and S3 scenarios and decided to move to a slightly more conservative weighting than Q2 with baseline
at 60% and S3 at 40% versus two-thirds, one-third last quarter.
On that note, as shown on slide 24, we had another quarter of excellent loss results with less than $50,000 in net
charge-offs. This brings our five quarter cumulative net charge-offs to 5 basis points, or an average of 1 basis
point per quarter. Our past dues, NPAs, criticized and classified assets remain low. Our ending reserves,
excluding PPP loans, are shown on slide 29, and were 135 basis points or 147 basis points, including the reserve
unfunded commitments. The $75 million and remaining unrecognized discount on acquired loans represents
another 33 basis points.
Turning to capital, with the pending Atlantic Capital merger and Safe Harbor limitations, our repurchase activity
was more muted during the quarter after announcement with total repurchases of 485,000 shares in Q3 and an
additional 120,000 shares in early October. We're out of the market until the Atlantic Capital shareholder meeting,
which is scheduled for November 16. Even with the increase in loan growth and repurchase activity, our capital
ratios remained strong, with a leverage ratio of 8.1%, CET1 of 11.9% and total risk-based capital at 13.7%. TBV
per share ended the quarter at $43.98, up 10.4% over the last year.
I'll now turn it over to Doug to give a few highlights on Atlantic Capital's quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas L. Williams
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital
Thank you, Will, and good morning. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share Atlantic Capital's third quarter
results with you. As you know, we filed our earnings release and investor presentation last night and those are
available on our website. First, I'd like to thank my Atlantic Capital teammates for another great quarter. Despite
the added work of merger, integration planning and related distractions, they remain focused on helping our
clients, pursue opportunities and meet challenges. While the economic recovery slowed during the quarter due to
the Delta variant surge and there are uncertainties about the effect of fiscal and monetary policies on the course
of the economy, our clients are performing well and continue to make investments for the future.
Those investments are driving our new business pipelines and resulting loan growth. With strong growth in loans,
deposits and revenue, Atlantic Capital recorded another quarter of solid operating results. As we reported, Atlantic
Capital earned $0.65 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2021, compared to $0.58 for the second quarter and
$0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Pre-provision net revenue was $14.7 million, a 9%
annualized increase from the second quarter and an increase of 36% compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Loans held for investment excluding PPP loans grew 12% annualized from the second quarter of 2021 and 14%

year-over-year. Loan origination volume was strong across all our banking teams, and net loan growth was
particularly strong in the commercial and industrial and commercial owner occupied real estate categories.
Since Atlantic Capital became a public company almost six years ago, these commercial loan categories have
grown at a 13% compound average growth rate. Credit quality is excellent. There were no net charge-offs during
the quarter. Non-performing assets as a percent of total assets was 0.10% at quarter end and criticized and
classified loans decreased 34%. As you've seen, we recorded a negative provision of $2.4 million for the quarter.
The allowance for credit losses, excluding PPP loans was 1.18% at quarter end. With sharp focus on corporate
treasury management business for Atlanta-based enterprises and for high volume payments and fintech
companies across the country, Atlantic Capital's built a strong core deposit franchise.
Since we became a public company almost six years ago, average total deposits have grown 20% compounded
annually, and average demand deposits have grown at a 30% compound average growth rate. Payments
volumes, service charges and average deposits in the payments and fintech business continue to grow in the
40% range. For the third quarter average deposits increased 13% annualized on a linked quarter basis and grew
38% year-over-year. The average cost of deposits was 8 basis points, down from 10 basis points last quarter.
Non-interest bearing demand deposits averaged more than 39% of average total deposits. As we look ahead to
the fourth quarter and to [ph] 2020 (16:07), our new business pipelines are robust and we expect continued strong
momentum and loan deposit and revenue growth. Pat Oakes and I will be available to answer your questions
during the Q&A portion of our call this morning. Now back to John.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thanks, Doug. So we're encouraged with the healthy loan growth in the quarter. Our progress on expense
savings and growth in core net interest income and with the strength of Atlantic Capital's results in a rising interest
rate backdrop, we're feeling good about our momentum as we head into 2022.
Operator, let's open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jennifer Demba of Truist.
Jennifer, over to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Good morning, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Congratulations on a very good quarter. Do you think your pipeline and your business momentum right now could
mean better than mid-single digit loan growth continuing over the near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, Jennifer. There is a slide we put in the deck on page 12, which I think is very illustrative of what's going on
through the pandemic and the rising loan production that we've experienced this quarter with loan production
originations of $2.6 billion that's up from last quarter and it's up 72% from a year ago. And from a net growth
standpoint, it's the highest net loan growth we've had at $573 million. If you go back two-and-a-half years, it's
more than double, the net loan growth dollars that we've experienced. Part of this is seasonal basis that we had.
We did some business with some companies that do hurricane cleanup for power companies, and that was a part
of the growth this quarter.
Our pipelines are growing into October. But at the same time, we're continuing to see sales of some operating
companies and some sales of some CRE properties with these low cap rates. So I think our guidance, Jennifer,
originally it was mid-single digits for the back half of this year, we wound up at 10% for the third quarter. As I look
ahead into the fourth quarter, maybe because of some of these seasonal businesses as well as some of these
[indiscernible] (18:46), we might be low to mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter. But I think our trajectory as
we head into 2022 is going to look like mid to upper single digits, which I think is the guidance we've given
previously. So I think we're on track mid to upper single digits in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And can you quantify how much of that loan production in the third quarter was from that more hurricane-
related lending?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Yeah. It's about a third of the net loan growth, that's business that we have some clients that do work for large
power companies in the Northeast and the Gulf Coast states that come in after the hurricane. So that business
typically increases in the third quarter. It's flat in the fourth, and you see some of it come down in the first and
second quarter of the following year. So, it's about a third of the overall growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. My last question is on asset quality, your losses have been extraordinarily low. What's your outlook for the
couple of years? Do you think they can stay really low, maybe not quite this low, but really low?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
I think historically, if you look at the asset quality metrics of our company, Doug's at 0% charge-offs, SouthState,
CenterState, all very conservative underwriters relative to peer groups and the metrics, if you go back through the
cycle. Right now, Jennifer, we're sitting on a tremendous amount of cash on the sidelines with our banks, but also
with our consumer and commercial customers. So, I would think that at least in the short to intermediate time
period in the next year or so, we'll continue to see good asset quality metrics as long as there's so much cash in
our clients' balance sheets.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I wanted to just real quick, just on the seasonal, the hurricane commercial relationship. So, in terms of modeling,
should we expect that this kind of similar I think you said it was about a third of the overall C&I growth, so that's
about $110 million to $150 million or so. Should I expect that level of seasonality in the third quarter every year
going forward?

John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
This is like predicting the weather. So, our clients this year had client relationships where storms landed. So it
might be a little bit outsized this year than it would be in the future. But it's a business we like a lot. The
counterparty on the other end of the repayment is these large publicly traded power companies. So this year, I
think it's a little more outsized just because of where the hurricanes landed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Okay. Maybe just on the mortgage business; could you tell me what the size of the servicing portfolio
was at the end of the quarter? I think it was $5.8 billion at June 30 just in terms of the size of the loans that you're
servicing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Brody, Steve. I don't have the number in front of me, but it's pretty close to that number. It might be closer to
$6 billion and we did grow it a little bit over the quarter. But yes, somewhere in that general vicinity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Thank you. And the last couple of quarters you've ratcheted down the amount of production you've
sold into the secondary market, from like 70% or so closer to like 55%. Just thinking about the puts and the takes
between your expectations around growth on the commercial side, and then the residential production. Should we
expect the secondary percentage to kind of remain in the 55% range going forward or should we expect it to
move back up to the 70% range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, I would think it's probably somewhere in between, I would think it's probably closer to 60%. I think
what's going to happen if you look at the [ph] NBA (23:29) forecast for next year, the refinance index is supposed
to be considerably down, which doesn't bother us very much because 70% of our business is [ph] purchased
(23:40), but what that will do on our portfolio loans likely is it'll just allow for less refinance there. And so just the
natural evolution of loan growth in our own portfolio, it'll just stick longer because we won't have as much
prepayments. But obviously as we think about the economics of whether to sell a loan or whether to keep a loan,
it has to do with the gain on sale margins. It has to do with what our liquidity positions are. There are several
things, but I think 60% is probably a good modeling, that's how we're modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you for that. Just on the balance sheet, the securities growth, thinking about the yields that you put
on this quarter, where they – what's the [indiscernible] (24:27) of the portfolio? And what are your current plans for
securities growth here in the fourth quarter?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Yeah, Brody. Steve, again. We had a slide in there, I think it's page 16, which just describes sort of the growth in
our securities book and also sort of the position and our cash position. So at the end of the third quarter, we had
$5.7 billion in cash and $6.4 billion securities book. As you mentioned, it did grow $700 million, I think we
mentioned on the call, our best forecast was we're going to grow at $500 million or so a quarter. What happened
of course in the end of the September, we had – saw a nice rate increase and so took advantage of some of that
toward the end of the quarter.
As we think about that portfolio and as you all model relative to us and Atlantic Capital combined, today we're
around little less than 16% of investment assets. I think for us, as we look at it as a combined company on a $45
billion balance sheet, we're somewhere between 16% and 18% is the way I would kind of model it, maybe 17% or
so and then we're just going to see what the yield curve does from here. There's so much uncertainty, but I think
we've gotten to a position we feel a lot more comfortable with than where we were a few quarters, where we were
more like 11% or 12% of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And, Brody, it's Will. I'll just add that that assumes that we don't have unexpected additional deposit growth. I think
the industry received more liquidity coming into deposits this year than many of us expected. So it's hard to
predict, but based on what we see today, that's our expectation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And if you look at that and kind of play that out to the end of next year with Atlantic Capital and with [indiscernible]
(26:25) flat deposit rates and with our loan growth the way John mentioned it, we're still going to have $4 billion of
cash sitting on the balance sheet. So I think we're going to have plenty of flexibility to do whatever is necessary
when the time comes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And I just have a couple more here. On the origination side on the loans, what are new origination
yields coming on that? A lot other companies have bemoaned how competitive it is. And so I just wanted to get a
sense from you where that's hanging out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, I think Will mentioned in his remarks, I think it's 3.18% this quarter, was the new production. And
part of this is, of course, the duration of what the lending you're doing and we're trying to be prudent there relative
to swapping some larger deals and sometimes that shows up in the yield day one and doesn't show up over a
period of time depending on what LIBOR or SOFR does. So our yield was 3.18%. With the [ph] pack up and
(27:28) rates I would expect, particularly the five year treasuries backed up probably 30 basis points or 40 basis
points, I would expect those new production yield would start moving back up towards 3.50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then last one, just on the provision, you all took another 20 bps or so out of the reserve ratio this
quarter. Could you just refresh me real quick, I thought it was for the day one combined was [indiscernible]

(27:58) SouthState, and is that still a good level to think about from a normalized provisioning perspective going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, it's Will. It's a hard question to answer. So I think that is a reasonable forecast. But the complexity
you have with CECL being adopted when it was and then the unprecedented government reaction that has
occurred, and then the leading to a recession where people didn't have credit losses is going to impact the
statistical historical correlation between recessionary type, economic metrics and loss drivers and resulting
losses. So it'll be an interesting issue for the whole industry to tackle when you're going to have a dataset come
into that historical data that's going to be abnormal at best. So, yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to model, but
I just want to clarify that it's a tough modeling proposition based on the fact that we've been through a period with
really no losses in spite of a recession.

[indiscernible] (29:40) question on expenses, you saw nice reduction in expenses this quarter just given we had
the cost savings fully coming in. But we've seen from really most of your peers that have reported so far an
increase in expenses just given wage inflation and higher technology costs and all the things. So update us on
some of your thoughts on expense growth from here and what you think a kind of fair run rate is for 2022 maybe
once we've got ACBI's cost savings fully in there?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Catherine. We still expect, in the shorter term Q4 to be what we had had projected before. There are always
a few things that move one way or another that are hard to predict. This quarter we had some things with health
insurance claims, for example, we're self-insured, but generally we think that that range of $210 million to $215
million that we expressed before us is about right for the fourth quarter. So similar to Q3. Looking ahead, we're
still completing our budgeting process. The guidance that we have given to the team is that we need to and
expect to be in the low single digits in terms of our expense growth for next year. And as we've said, with Atlantic
Capital, we expect to save roughly a third of their expense base. That's about $20 million on an annualized basis
or $5 million a quarter. With us doing the conversion late Q2, you'll start to see that in Q3 and it'll show up more in
Q4 for them. Having said all that of course, we are in the same competitive market. Everyone else is for labor and
all that, but we're working hard to try to keep our expense growth down to that low single digit range.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And I think you mentioned earlier that the ACBI conversion you think as late Q2. Have you changed when you
believe you will close the deal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
No, we have not. As you noted, there are two remaining things we need to achieve to be able to close, one the
shareholder vote which is scheduled for November 16 and then secondly receive Federal Reserve approval.
We've received OCC approval. So we have no reason to believe that our currently planned January 1 closing
would be beyond that. But it's out of our control.

Hey, good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just to follow up, Will on your comment there, did I hear you say that correctly that you guys do need DC Fed
approval on the deal? And I know we just – I think there was one two days ago that maybe got DC Fed approval,
but I'm sure there's another deal kind of in your markets that's been delayed. So I guess, have you gotten any
insights on what that timeline might be? I know you said you don't have any reason to believe it's changed, but
just anecdotally what you're hearing from people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Hey, Stephen, it's John. We got OCC approval rather rapidly. As Will said, the shareholder vote is set. So we've
heard nothing concerning at all from the Federal Reserve, but we do know that they've got a lot on their plate right
now. So I think the ball's in their court. And so we're optimistic and haven't heard any reason why there would be
delays, but that's in Washington.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Fair enough. And then, John, you mentioned kind of for 2022, the strategic focus is really more on
[indiscernible] (33:33) ACBI organic growth, continued new hires and you all put out some pretty impressive press
releases around the new talent you've been able to add. I'm just wondering if you can frame that up in some way,
kind of if you have numbers on how many lenders you've added over the last 12 months or kind of what your total
pool of lenders are or what percentage increase anything like that that would kind of frame up just how big an
opportunity that's been on the hiring front.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, we added – we did a press release. We added nine bankers in the third quarter and the trend is very
similar. They typically – 20 to 25, 30-year veterans coming out of the largest banks in the metro markets, typically
they are long-term middle market bankers, commercial bankers and treasury specialists. So, we've just got a
unique opportunity here with the company that we built that has both an entrepreneurial culture as well as the
scale to compete with the largest banks that it's become a very, very attractive platform for us. So, I look for that
pace to continue. I think in the last 12 months, I think it's been in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 a quarter, so 35, 40
bankers a year that we're looking to add. And we're real encouraged with the platform we've got and the attraction
that it has for these bigger bankers.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
Okay. Very helpful, maybe just last thing for me, I know Atlantic Capital had a recent press release talking about
their expanded self-relationship, and I'm just wondering, I don't know if Doug's still available, if there's any
commentary there of just understanding what that expanded relationship means and what it could mean for the
pro forma company. Any increases to kind of expectation since the deal was announced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas L. Williams A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital
Stephen, the press release that you're referring to talked about that we are beginning to issue secured credit
cards for self. And I think as of the close of the quarter, we have several thousand cards outstanding now with an
average balance of maybe a couple hundred dollars. And again, these are secured cards. So this is another
avenue of loan growth under the self program. We have the credit builder account. These are the secured
installment – CD secured installment loans that have an average balance in the several hundred dollar range.
And now we're adding the credit card, secured credit cards where average balances maybe in a couple of
hundred dollar range and we expect this to grow rapidly over the next few quarters. Earlier this year, we had a
$200 million guidance limit for self. We've increased that to $500 million to accommodate anticipated growth. So I
think you'll see growth accelerate over the next few quarters from self.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. That's really helpful. Thanks for all the color, guys, and congrats on a great quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A

Thank you, Stephen.

Operator: Thank you, Stephen. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Christopher Marinac of Janney
Montgomery Scott. Christopher, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thank you, ma'am. I guess if we stick with Doug for a second, these really strong deposit growth as well as the
cash that's still outstanding in Atlantic Capital, is any of that temporary, Doug or is that still kind of a permanent
part of your [indiscernible] (37:20)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas L. Williams A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital
There's some seasonality. As you know Chris, we typically build balances in the last two quarters of the year, but
that's going to stick around. It did the last year. And I don't see any significant moves to withdraw liquidity from the
system in terms of monetary policy and so forth. So, it is organic. I think it will stick around. There are some
seasonality there related to the ACH processing business for payroll companies, but I think we'll see most of that
hang around.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Chris, I would focus on the average, not that period end balance...

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
...because that period end balance is inflated. With the payroll business we have, Thursday is a big number for
us. So, quarter ended on a Thursday, so that does inflate the balance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas L. Williams A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlantic Capital
But again, on an average basis, we had 13% linked quarter annualized growth in deposits and we had 38% –
36%, 38% growth year-over-year. So, strong mid-teens percentage average growth in the past. So, I think it's a
trend that's sustainable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thanks for that and back to the SouthState side. I just want to ask more about the correspondent banking
business, both on the ARC opportunities in the next couple of quarters, as well as any new products that you
envision in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Chris. That business has really performed pretty steadily this year. If you think about the opportunity there,
all the banking system has excess deposits that they have to do one or two things, they either have to loan it or
invest it. And so, just like we have all this excess liquidity, so do our clients, thousand clients. And so, I would
think the shape of the yield curve is going to matter there, so as the yield curve gets steeper, we'll do more fixed
income. As the yield curve gets flatter, we'll do more swap income on loans. Even in the last couple of days,
you've seen the interest rate curve flatten. My guess is [indiscernible] (39:35) pick up some, but anyway, I think
what we're trying to do is build out some I'll call it little specialties within some of those fixed income and ARC
products. I don't think they're huge needle movers relative to the income, but you'll just continue to see, I think
really solid performance out of that group, it's a great business, $100 million plus of revenue business. So it's
done really done really well and been pretty steady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Steve, thanks for that. And just last question perhaps for Will is the fixed rate lending in the portfolio I think
is 49%. Do you envision that changing much as 2022 and 2023 come into focus particularly post the merger?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Chris, [indiscernible] (40:21) that's been a pretty consistent number for us over time, and I'll remind you too
the fixed rate lending we do with the exception of some portfolio mortgages generally are going to be in that five
year sort of range. And so there's sort of a constant amortization of that rolling through. And that's an important
part of our asset sensitivity, but I think it's even more important I guess is that core funding [ph] basin (40:49).
We've got a slide in the deck that shows our deposit cost over the last cycle beginning back in 2015 that's on slide

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2021
19 of the deck if you are going to take a look at that, but I think that's really more of the asset sensitivity story than
in fact the loan repricing. But to answer your question directly, no, I don't see that changing really significantly
from where it is today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
And, Chris, I'd add. We did have [indiscernible] (41:16) page 19 and I just think it's worth, when you have time, to
look at for probably everyone on the call, because I do think it illustrates the rising rate – interest rate sensitivity
we have and so much of it is tied to our deposit base. And it really illustrates the importance of our deposits. And
what we did on this slide on page 19 was we went back to the last rate cycle starting in the fourth quarter of 2015,
all the way to the end of the rate cycle, second quarter of 2019. And we plotted three things. We plotted our
combined deposit cost, which is the bottom line, middle line is the fed funds rate and the top line is the five year
Treasury, which is where we do a lot of our lending and commercial lending and others.
And what it shows is our combined deposit beta was only 24%, but I probably direct you to second quarter of
2018. In the second quarter 2018, the fed funds rate was only 1.75%, but our deposit beta was only 15% at the
date, the five year Treasury was 2.75% and our combined bank traded at more than 3 times tangible book. The
secret to this franchise is the rising rate and the deposit lag in the book. So anyway, just wanted to – back to
interest rate sensitivity, we try to put that slide in just to give you some history of the combined company where
we think the future earnings power is if we get a low yield curve [ph] out (42:51).

No. I appreciate that. That's great disclosure. Thanks for highlighting that graph.
