Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Allen and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event
is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations.
Kristin, you may begin.

Kristin Silberberg
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan
Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide
additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor
Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include
forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ
materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the presentation. We also reference
non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the presentation and the
reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced solid results today
and we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. Highlights for the quarter include very strong
peak performance, good deposit cost management, tight expense control and credit metrics which were within
expectations.
Our balance sheet remains robust with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%, our loan to deposit ratio was 80%, our ACL ratio
was 1.63% and Federal Home Loan Bank advances are now below $600 million. Of note, we saw our revenues
tick up relative to Q1. Our underlying PPNR grew by 2% over Q1. Our underlying net income grew by $13 million
or 3%. We repurchased $200 million in shares over the quarter with our sequential EPS up 4%. The combination
of our strong capital position, solid returns and capital freed up from non-core rundown has allowed us the capital
flexibility to support our customers and to return capital to shareholders. Share count is down over 5% versus a
year ago. Our fee growth was relatively broad as capital markets fees continued their rebound led by loan
syndications and bond underwriting. Wealth and card fees both hit record levels. We also are seeing nice
momentum in our well-position payments business.
Our Private Bank had a terrific quarter. We reached $4 billion in deposits, up from $2.4 billion in Q1 and tracking
well towards our yearend 2025 goal of $11 billion. We brought in two leading private wealth teams in the quarter,
one from San Francisco and one from Boston and we've reached $3.6 billion in assets under management at
quarter end with nice momentum. Our commercial bank hired a middle market leader for Florida and for California
during the quarter, two increasingly important states for us. Our overall commercial franchise continues to be well-
positioned in serving the middle market, private capital and key growth verticals and we look for our strong
performance to continue in the second half. I should pause to give a shout out to Don McCree, for his
appointment as Senior Vice Chair in June. Great recognition for his efforts over the years at Citizens.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
We have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives. TOP 9 is tracking well to targets and we have
commenced work on TOP 10, which will push into new areas like AI. Our BSO work is progressing well, non-core
ran down $1.1 billion in the quarter. Commercial C&I is refocusing on deep relationships, and we have a medium-
term plan to reduce our CRE exposure. Credit metrics are holding up fine outside of General Office, we continue
the lengthy workout of General Office, which will take several more quarters before we see improvement. Roughly
70% of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district, or loss given default have been about half
of CBD properties. The good news is that we have our arms around the issue and we don't expect to see major
surprises.
Looking forward, we continue to be upbeat about our prospects. While there are still many uncertainties in the
external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise. And we maintain
a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium-term.
Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank, and the
aspiration to have the premier bank-owned Private Bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and
operating discipline that you've come to expect from us.
With that, let me turn it over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, second quarter results were very solid in a
number of key areas. Starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record
results in wealth and card. Also, we managed our deposit portfolio quite well with stable balances and lower
interest bearing costs in a competitive environment which positively impacted NII and NIM.
Rounding our quarterly results, expenses and credit came in largely as expected. With respect to balance sheet
strength, we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of
our peer group. And importantly, we are executing well against our various multiyear strategic initiatives, including
the buildout of our Private Bank. I'll summarized further highlights of second quarter financial results referencing
slides 3 to 6.
We generated underlying net income of $408 million for the second quarter, EPS of $0.82 and ROTCE of 11.1%.
Maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority, and we ended the second quarter with a CET1 at
10.7% or about 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also maintained our strong funding and liquidity
profile in the second quarter. Our pro forma LCR is 119%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1
requirement of 100% and our period end LDR improved to 80.4%.
On the funding front, we've reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by about $1.5 billion, linked quarter to $553
million. We continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful
$750 million senior debt issuance during the second quarter. And we added about another $1 billion of auto-
backed borrowings. That was our fourth issuance, essentially completing our auto program, and it was executed
at our tightest credit spreads to date. We also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing $400
million of new preferred and redeeming $300 million of higher coupon floating rate preferred on July 8.
Credit losses of approximately 180 million were in-line with our expectations. The NCO rate rose a little to 52
basis points, reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.63% is

up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes an 11.1% coverage for General Office, up from 10.6% in
the prior quarter. Regarding our strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well, having generated $4
billion of deposits and $3.6 billion of AUM through the second quarter. Also, our investments over the years in the
private capital and capital markets space are playing out nicely as demonstrated this quarter. Finally, we are
excited about our top of house initiatives, including the ongoing benefits from BSO and TOP, as well as growing
contributions expected from data and technology related initiatives such as generative AI and cloud migration.
Next, I'll talk through the second quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide 7. As
expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances. With respect to
NIM, as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide, our margin was down 4 basis points to 2.87%,
reflecting a 6 basis point increase in swap expense due to the 60 basis point decline in average receive rate in the
quarter. This was partly offset by a net increase in NIM of 2 basis points from all other sources, including higher
asset yields, non-core runoff and good deposit cost performance with interest bearing deposit costs down 3 basis
points. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment with our interest
bearing deposit beta at 51%, which was down from 52% in Q1.
Moving to slide 8. Our fees were up 7% linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and
wealth results. Our capital markets business improved 14% linked quarter with higher bond underwriting and loan
syndication fees given strong refinancing activity. M&A advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter.
However, our deal pipeline remains strong and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of 2024.
It's great to see our capital markets business holding the number one middle market sponsor bookrunner position
for the second quarter in a row. This reflects the benefit of the investments we've made in our capabilities since
the IPO and demonstrates the diversification of the business.
Card fees were a record, primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card
platform, as well as seasonally higher purchase volume. We delivered record results in wealth driven by
increased sales activity as well as higher asset management fees, given the constructive market environment and
contribution from the Private Bank, which will continue to grow given the AUM increase in the second quarter from
our wealth team hires. Mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the MSR valuation net of
hedging and an improvement in servicing P&L. Production fees were down slightly, given a decline in margins.
On slide 9, underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation. And
we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9
program is progressing well and we continue to expect to deliver a $135 million pre-tax run rate benefit by the end
of the year. We've commenced work on our TOP 10 program and we'll provide more details later this year.
On slide 10, period end and average loans are down 1% linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance
sheet and prioritize relationship based lending. The linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our Non-
Core portfolio of $1.1 billion. Core loans were broadly stable, with a slight reduction in commercial balances,
largely offset by an increase in retail. The decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower
returning credit only relationships, lower client loan demand and corporates continuing to issue in the debt
markets. Next on slides 11 and 12, we continue to do an excellent job on deposits in an extremely competitive
environment. Period end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset
by strong growth in the Private Bank.
We continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand on lower cost deposits to higher cost interest bearing
accounts, with the Fed holding steady as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the Private Bank.
As a result, non-interest bearing deposits are stable at about 21% of total deposits. Our deposit franchise is highly

diversified across product mix and channels. About 69% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits,
and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed
us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment. Our interest bearing
deposit costs were down three basis points linked quarter, given proactive management of our pricing strategy.
Moving to credit on slide 13, net charge-offs were 52 basis points up, 2 basis points linked quarter reflecting
broadly stable charge-offs and lower average loans. The commercial charge-offs in the quarter were largely
driven by CRE General Office and the fact that C&I recoveries were higher in one quarter versus Q2. This
increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail, primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and
runoff. Non-accrual loans increased 4% linked quarter, driven by increases in CRE General Office and
Multifamily, which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.63%, which is a 2
basis point increase from the first quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances, given Non-
Core runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization. Our reserve of $369 million for the $3.3
billion General Office portfolio represents an 11.1% coverage, up from 10.6% in the first quarter. Additionally,
since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $319 million of cumulative losses in the General Office
portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding, this represents roughly a 17% loss
rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion.
Over the past six quarters, the General Office portfolio was down roughly $900 million to $3.3 billion at June 30,
given paydowns of about $500 million and the charge offs I just mentioned. The loss experienced so far has been
concentrated in the central business district properties, with approximately 2 times the loss rate of suburban
properties. Suburban exposure is 70% of our total at this point. On the bottom left of the page, you can see some
of the key assumptions driving the General Office Reserve coverage level, which we believe represents a severe
scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very
strong.
Moving to slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 10.7%, up
10 basis points from 1Q and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory
proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of
our peers. You can see on slide 16 where our CET1 stands currently relative to peers. Given our strong capital
position, we repurchased another $200 million in common shares and including dividends we returned a total of
$394 million to shareholders in the second quarter.
Moving to slide 17, our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank
amongst our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank on Private Bank and wealth franchise.
First, we have a strong, transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise grounded in
primary relationships and high-quality customer growth. Notably, the transformation of our consumer deposit
franchise is the chief reason our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle. We
are much more nimble in our deposit-raising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools
and where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time, so far this cycle we are better than peer
median. We also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building durable relationships
with our customers, and we are focused on scaling our wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great
progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit share as we build our customer
base, particularly in New York Metro.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Next, we believe we have built the leading commercial bank amongst the super-regional banks. We are focusing
on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high growth sectors of the economy, and we have full
set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve
the private capital ecosystem, which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest deal-making
periods in decades. We are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop, and our
consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have
a right to win as activity picks up.
Finally, we're building a premier Private Bank and that is going very well and gaining momentum. We are growing
our client base and now have about $4 billion of attractive deposits, a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter,
with roughly 30% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $1.4 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We
recently opened the Private Banking offices in Mill Valley, California, and Palm Beach, Florida, and we are
opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Citizens Wealth
Management Business as the centerpiece of that effort.
We added two exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter; one from San Francisco and the
other from Boston, bringing the total Private Bank AUM to $3.6 billion, well on our way to hit our $10 billion target
by the end of 2025. Importantly, our Private Bank revenue increased 68% to about $30 million in the second
quarter, and we are on track to breakeven on the bottom line later this year.
Moving to slide 18, we provide the guide for the third quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut
in each of September and December. We expect NII to be down 1% to 2%, driven by one last step-up in swap
costs this cycle. Noninterest income should be up slightly, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets more than
offset by a pickup across other categories. We expect noninterest expense to be stable.
Net charge-offs are expected to be down modestly, and the ACL should continue to benefit from Non-Core runoff.
Our CET1 ratio is expected to come in about 10.5%, with approximately $250 million to $300 million of share
repurchases currently planned. With respect to the full year 2024 guide we provided in January, we feel good
about the overall level of PPNR. Revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes. NII is expected
to come in at the upper end of the down 6% to 9% range, reflecting lower loan balances with NIM trending
modestly better. Fees should come in modestly above the range of 6% to 9% originally expected. You should
expect us to continue to do well on expenses, which will be broadly in line with the January guide. We expect NII
and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter, given swap costs that peaked in the third quarter with a
return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In addition, net charge-offs are trending in line with our
January expectations. We continue to expect to end the year with a target CET1 ratio of approximately 10.5% and
the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth.
To wrap up, we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets, record results in wealth and
card, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. Our capital levels are strong, near the
top of our peer group, and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding. Our unique multiyear strategic
initiatives, including the build-out of our Private Bank are progressing well, and our Consumer and Commercial
Banking businesses are well-positioned to drive strong performance over the medium-term. Given these tailwinds,
combined with strong execution and tight expense management, we remain confident in our ability to hit our
medium-term 16% to 18% return target.
And with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, John. Allen, let's open it up for Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Can you provide an update on the loan outlook in the second half of the year and maybe just talk about customer
sentiment, and what it's going to take to kind of move them off the sidelines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll go ahead and jump on that one. So, I mean, I think we're seeing pretty positive signs for 2H as it relates
to loan growth. You know, when we look at the three different businesses that really will drive that, we've got the
Private Bank, which has demonstrated the ability to not only grow deposits and AUM, but the Private Bank is
actually penetrating its customer base and growing loans in the second quarter. And we expect that to actually
continue and begin to accelerate into the second half.
In the commercial space, customer activity's picking up. We do expect to see and particularly in our sort of, we
call them, M&A advisory-related driven finance arena, we're seeing some opportunities in the subscription line
space, as well as some pickup in funds finance. And then in retail, where we've been seeing some opportunities
in HELOC and mortgage. So all three legs of our stool, as we call it, are starting to demonstrate the ability to
really deliver on that loan growth expectation as you look out into the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, John, I'll jump in on that. It's Don. I think, one of the interesting things we've seen, and this goes to capital
markets also, is a real pickup in new money activity over the last six to eight weeks as the interest rate cycle
appears to be abating and the economy seems to be okay.
So, that's driving growth in subscription lines, that's driving a little bit more bullishness among our core C&I
customers, and it's certainly driving opportunistic activity among the PE firms. So, I think we'll see some decent

growth in the second half of the year. Exact timing, I'm not exactly sure, but we did see at the end of the second
quarter, the beginnings of some pretty significant draws on our subscription lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I'll jump in too on the Consumer and Private Banking side. The Consumer story is a little complicated
given the Non-Core rundown where we're running down $800 million to $1 billion each quarter. But if you put that
aside, the fundamentals of our core loan business are actually growing at a reasonable clip, really led by
residential lending and a little bit in card. Our HELOC position incredibly strong and with rates being higher than
we had expected going into the year and our customers having the most home equity in their personal balance
sheet in the history of the United States, our HELOC market position is reaping a lot of benefits for us, so we're
seeing very strong HELOC growth.
Despite the mortgage challenges, some modest growth in the mortgage portfolio and we're starting to see a bit of
a tick up on the card book. And then turning to the Private Bank really, our offering is much broader than what the
team that we hired was used to. So we're starting to see a diversification of that book. Early days, it was really led
by private equity and venture capital call lines, that's still a strength of the business model. We did see in this last
quarter in Q2 a diversification towards consumer. So consumer is now 36% of the loan book versus in the low
20's earlier in the year.
So, mortgage is starting to pick up, some HELOC lending and still continued strength in business banking and
private equity we expect that trend to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
That's great color. Thank you. And just on a separate question, just the stress capital buffer came in higher than I
was expecting. I'm sure it's higher than what you expected. Are there any plans to kind of reassess any of the
businesses to help drive a lower SCB? Bruce, you mentioned some plans over the medium-term to reduce the
CRE exposure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I guess we were a bit disappointed in the SCB result and I'd say, I think the Fed overall does a pretty good
job on credit. They are very conservative, but they have a lot of data to work from and where we've consistently
been frustrated has been on their modeling of PPNR. And so our own modeling of PPNR is in a much more
robust, I think we do things like we pickup forward starting swaps, we tailor the situation to the scenario where if
rates are much lower than we're going to see a pickup in mortgage fees and a pickup in capital markets fees
depending on a scenario.
But anyway, I'd say we had – the good news is we have sufficient capital. We've run at a conservative level. So
having a higher SCB than we think is appropriate isn't really hindering our strategy. And so I don't think, Peter,
that we need to make significant changes to the business model. I think we're on the right track.
Having said that, the balance sheet optimization is still places where there is work to do to optimize the risk
adjusted returns that we make off the balance sheet and to hopefully improve some of the stress results on the
credit side. And so, CRE, we could see that run down. We topped up after we did the investors acquisition a lot of
that was kind of low risk multifamily. But certainly, we want to create the capacity to lend in areas that really

further [ph] deeper (00:28:32) relationships and we'll have more C&I kind of fill some of that void as we bring
down CRE, would probably be the biggest shift that you'd see on the balance sheet over time.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
This question, the first question is for John. John, I think you were at a conference in June and you talked about
very positively about an exit rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the net interest margin. I'm wondering if you
could readdress that again and maybe put it in context of, you noted that the swap costs were peaking in the third
quarter. If you can give that in context on how you expect your asset yields to traject, as we think about that
September and December rate cut. And obviously, the 3 basis point improvement in interest-bearing deposit
costs are notable, thoughts on the trajectory from here, whether it's in context of the rate cuts and without?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sure. Erika, I guess what I'll start off with is that at the beginning of the year, we did indicate that we thought
the exit NIM would be in that neighborhood of 2.85% or so. I'd say that as we've gotten into the middle part of the
year, we expect that to come in a little better. So, I think I did mention that at conference earlier last quarter. And I
think we can confirm that those trends continue to be looking good that we're going to end up a little better than
what we expected.
And broadly, what we said at the time was that we saw loans coming in a little lower and pushed out a little bit
more than we had originally expected. But that was getting offset in part from better net interest margin trends.
We were pleased to be able to print a very strong interest bearing deposit costs number that was down 3 basis
points this quarter. You know, I think it's very likely that our interest bearing deposit costs have peaked in the first
quarter, that we have some nice opportunity to kind of price our rollovers of CD's in the second quarter and that
was a tailwind.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
I think there'll be some variability there, but I think 1Q is probably the peak and that'll provide a nice tailwind as
you get into the second half of the year. I mean broadly the trends when you get into the fourth quarter are along
the following lines. Every quarter we're generating a couple of basis points of positive benefit from all other
sources outside of swaps. And so, given the third quarter is the last time that we'll see a step up in swap costs,
really that, those – that the rest of the bank will be able to drive net interest margin rising off of that NIM trough in
3Q into 4Q.
And the big drivers would be, there's a number of them. I mean, we've got Non-Core which continues to runoff
and is providing about 2 basis points a quarter of net interest margin all by itself. You've got asset yields around 5
basis points or so, ex-swaps, given the front book back book dynamic that we're seeing, which is in that 200 to
300 basis point range of, from the standpoint of what's happening with securities and loans.
And then, you have the initiatives with the Private Bank, which is accretive across the board, which is contributing.
So all of those things I think you'll see contribute, and I'd say that, getting that first Fed cut in late September
would be, also helpful. It's not necessary for us to stay on track for having a really strong, rebound in 4Q but it
does help, I'd say, address, the higher for longer pressures that pricing pressures on deposits that will continue to
bump along, as you know, until that first cut comes out from the Fed.
So let me stop there and see if that addresses a number of the points that you made.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That does. And, as you layout the past and you said a third, from a rising costs for the net interest margin from
what you mentioned as a 3Q 2024 trough, I'm wondering about the size of the balance sheet. Do you feel like
your mix is optimized? In other words, as your investors think about a normalizing NIM and multiply that by your
balance sheet, is your balance sheet growth going to be in line with business growth, or will there be moves that
you're making in terms of, wholesale funding or whatever else that could move balance sheet growth sort of
underneath business growth or above business growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, it's good question. I think there might be two different answers here. One is, is in the second half of 2024,
we have a – at the balance sheet date here at June 30, we have a significant amount of excess liquidity. And so
you could see us deploy some of that into lending through the second half. And that'll – that's very powerful in
terms of the ability to drive net interest margin.
And so we're pleased to be able to do that given how strong our balance sheet position is at June 30. But I'd say
when you zoom out and think about the medium-term we, without a doubt have opportunity to grow the balance
sheet over time in line with business growth adjusted for the balance sheet optimization initiatives that we have in
place. But that powerful combination of net interest margin reflating into that, call it, what do we say, 3.25% to
3.40% range plus the opportunity to grow the balance sheet over the medium-term is really one of the – it is the
primary and majority driver of our ROTCE targets over the medium-term.
So, I think maybe a little bit of transition in 2H where we'll probably deploy some liquidity but then growing into
2025 and 2026 and beyond.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just add to that, Erika, is I do think we have one thing that's pretty unique to us, which is the launch of the
Private Bank. So if we just grow at kind of nominal GDP, kind of in the medium-term for Consumer and
Commercial, we should grow a little faster because the Private Bank is scaling up. And certainly as the customer
base grows and we keep adding and investing in the business, we should see additional growth there.

Well said, guys. Thank you.

Okay.

Mr. Nash, if you could please check your mute feature on your phone.

Kristin Silberberg A
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Allen, maybe we can come back to Ryan. Let's move on to the next question and we'll circle back to Ryan.

Operator: Yes, one moment, please. Mr. Nash, you will have to re-queue [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to
Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right, thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could sort of pivot to the fee story for a moment, that's been a
pretty solid story this quarter. And John, so it sounded like we'll see maybe some seasonal capital markets
weakness in the third quarter, but it feels like it's on a good trajectory. So, just maybe some thoughts on the
overall investment banking pipeline, how it looks and then just broader thoughts on the main drivers as you see
them for the fee-based outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'll start off with broader – the broader picture and maybe I'll let Don tell us a little bit more about the capital
markets pipeline outlook. But more broadly, I mean, we're really pleased with our performance in the second
quarter and printing another number one middle market sponsor position on the league table. It's nice to see for
the second quarter in a row. You know, 3Q is the typical seasonal period where it's a little down for capital
markets. And we expect that may play out, as it's done in prior years.
But I mean, I think the floor in those – in that seasonally down period is actually higher this year than it's been in
prior years. So that's something to keep in mind that given all of the investments, we actually sure will be down off
a great 2Q, but the floor is probably higher than prior years, number one. Number two, the diversification not only
within capital markets, but outside of capital markets and all the investments we've been making in wealth.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
We had those two significant asset management teams that we brought on board, plus all of our organic
investments inside the Private Bank and broadly is really driving wealth fees. So here to see wealth fees be a
bigger contributor in the third quarter.
And [ph] just how you see (00:37:55) the rate environment moving around, we're seeing opportunities and are
helping our customer hedge the exposure to rates. And so we're going to – we expect to see some benefit there.
And just a number of other categories, including service charges and an ability for possibly some mortgage
banking opportunities, as rates seem to be stabilizing and down. So, there's just a number of other categories,
given the diversification of the platform that will allow us to stay on track here as you head into the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And also, just to add to that, we did take some regulatory cleanup items in other income, so that was suppressed
in the quarter, which should bounce back next quarter. But with that, Don, why don't you give a little more color
on...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, so it's interesting. You know, the characteristics of the market are very favorable. Right now, there's
enormous amounts of liquidity. And that drove really the first half of the year, which was primarily a [ph] like
refinancing (00:38:54) market. So if you look at transactions done in the core capital markets being syndicated
lending and bonds, it was about 85% refinancing of existing exposures that were on people's balance sheet and
extending maturities and alike.
But what we didn't see and what we're beginning to see is new money activity led by the private equity team. So
as we move into a more favorable interest rate environment, a decent economic environment, we're starting to
see the pipelines really grow on the PE side of the business. And frankly, that's where the big underwritings are
and that's where the profitability drives. M&A is hanging in there pretty well. Remember, we are primarily a middle
market investment bank, so we do the mid-sized deals, $100 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, $100
million capital raise to a $1 billion capital raise.
So, those have actually been more resilient than the really big ticket M&A deals which are getting government
scrutiny and getting held up in regulatory approval. So those seem to be moving along reasonably well. The place
we haven't seen a lot, we've seen actually more than we saw last year is in the IPO side of the business. There
are a lot of IPOs that are kind of prepped and ready, but people aren't pulling the trigger and going to market. And
some of that's been the aftermarket performance of the IPO that have happened so far.
But continue to get the broadening of the equity markets and the high rise in the equity markets, you could see
some of that begin to come. And then we have a pretty decent pipeline in the convert side in the follow on side.
So it's broad-based, it's pretty encouraging. And I think the backdrop is very favorable for a good second half and
a great 2025, frankly. And we think we've got all the pieces we need to take advantage of the markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'd maybe just very quickly add on the consumer side, our improvement is very durable sticky fee revenue. So, the
card changes that both John and Bruce mentioned, we reissued 3.5 million debit cards last quarter and a new

contract that just drops directly to the bottom line. It's predictable and will stick around. Service charges has
bottomed out. Mortgage, we think, will be in the zone, it could be a little bit of favorability of rates – if rates drop a
little bit and then the wealth AUM growth is sticky, durable, repeatable fee income. So, that's what we're calling for
a steady, continued upward momentum on consumer without a lot of volatility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I'll just add one more thing is, is we're beginning to see – it's interesting because the Private Banking teams
never had a capital market business as their prior employer. And so we're starting to see some crossover activity
among the Private Banking clients that are coming on board in the capital markets. I don't know if that's a second
half thing, but I think that's a brand new opportunity from a client base that was never really resident at Citizens
before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Terrific. Thank you for that color. And then wanted to ask a little bit about the reserve and specifically the office
reserve. I think we're up at 11.1% now, which is of course very, very high. I guess I'm curious about the factors as
you might think about them that would allow you to start sort of absorbing losses with that existing reserve. In
other words, what sort of allows that office reserve to start to come down rather than to continue to tick up? I think
when you talk about the reserve more broadly, you've pointed to Non-Core runoff as being the thing that might
allow the reserve to benefit. But just curious about how office sits in there in particular?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I would say – I'll start and let John add color, but I'd say the office, there's still a lot of uncertainty in that
space, just what we're seeing in terms of valuations, cap rates, the path of future interest rates. And so, I think
we've played it conservatively with having a big reserve and then just kind of letting the charge-offs run through
while maintaining the reserve. I think you'd have to get to a point where you started to see things solidify a little bit
and start to move in the right direction, so to speak.
And I don't really see that happening actually for and certainly this year, it'll happen maybe sometime in next year.
So we're kind of prepared for a [ph] slog (00:43:07) here on office that we've got our arms around the properties.
We know what the maturity schedules are. We've got good people working with the borrowers to deliver good
outcomes. I don't expect we'll see any big surprises, but we'll continue to, I think, just work our way through it.
At the point where we hit a kind of feel better moment when things start to look like they're moving in the right
direction, that's when we'll be able to start to draw down on the reserve, and we'll reap a nice benefit when that
happens. John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I would just echo that point. I mean, just having some growing confidence in valuations and seeing maybe
transactions occur could be in all likelihood a 2025 outcome. And so, that this is a multi-quarter, probably
multiyear journey that we're on but, given all the balance sheet strength that we have, with our capital position, we
feel really confident that any uncertainties are expressed in the reserves and anything else would be supported by
the capital. I would also mention that we're working the book down. I mean, we started out at $4.2 billion. We're
down to $3.3 billion. So we're lowering the exposure every quarter. We're working on...

Some of that as a good way through repayments and some of it's through charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

Nonetheless, it is coming down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly. And, and so, we're getting some, kind of, payoffs and paydowns. We're getting, we're working through
the riskier credits. And we're having conversations that have been accelerated given our maturity profile that
we've had the opportunity to really lean in with our borrowers. And when and if we've come to sort of extensions,
we've been able to extract, in many cases, better positioning and collateral. So this is, as I said, multi-quarter
journey. And we're feeling good about where we're at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just to elevate, too, to the second part of your question is that away from that, away from the general
office, we're still feeling good about what we're seeing in the consumer metrics in commercial C&I. And we run
our reserve calculations based on scenarios. And clearly the risk of recession seems to be less than it was a
couple quarters ago. And so our need to keep adding to reserves for rest of the book would seem to be abating
somewhat. So that's why when we say, we'll continue to see, we're calling out a slightly lower charge-off number
in Q3. And then we have the trend of being able to draw down on those reserves, which I think will accelerate in
coming quarters.

Okay, great. Good morning. Hey, John and Bruce. On the cost side, so you guys are doing a really good job

like where the TOP and extra cost program are in terms of the offsets to be able to kind of still hold the line.

I know that it's kind of in line with your full year guidance, but just the puts and takes of kind of where we are at
this point of the year in terms of, if there's just more to come on TOP, to offset those hires and the growth and the
strong investment banking results, etcetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, thanks, Ken, for the question. You know, just talking about TOP, it's been emblematic of who we are, as
you know, for a number of years, the top line program is going to generate, call it, $135 million or so run rate
benefits when you get to the end of this year in 2024. The underpinnings of that program, we often have vendor
contributions, that's a big driver. We launched a data and analytics contribution this year, which will continue into
future years.
We've had a really interesting ability to invest in our fraud program and a number of other opportunities, including
branch rationalization that have underpinned a really strong TOP program this year. And, that, of course, is the
way over time we have been – and been able to invest in entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives while not
needing to cover that and to self-fund those kinds of things.
You know, the TOP 10 program, we're working on and, we're feeling good about the early opportunities. I think
we've launched some analysis in the generative AI space. And we're live on a couple of use cases, and I think
we're going to see an ability to broaden out there pretty, pretty nicely in terms of underpinning the next TOP
program.
There's a half dozen of other areas expanding data and analytics, what we're doing in our technology space,
which converging our platforms with our ability to converge our mainframes and, so I do think that we feel very
good about the ongoing ability to make investments and self-fund those investments to the TOP program in, as
you get into the end of 2024 and into 2025, and maybe I'll just stop there and see if there's anything else that
others would like to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. All right second question, I know that you issued $400 million preferreds and redeemed $300 million
in early July. And I think with that, you're still kind of in the [ph] 1.2%, 1.3% zone, maybe 1.3%(00:49:18)
preferreds to RWAs. As you contemplate the buyback, as you think about the SCB and all of that, like how do you
just think about the overall capital stack in terms of like what your ultimate goals are for optimization of your
capital position? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We're feeling pretty good about where we stand in the capital space. I mean, I think we basically think that around
[ph] 1.25% (00:49:43) is fine. We end up with that we probably have more CET1. So when you look at the overall
Tier 1 stack, we've got higher quality capital given the fact that we have more CET1 driving our overall Tier 1, [ph]
1.25% (00:50:01) is fine just probably, we probably won't go much below that. And a range of 1.25% to 1.50% of
RWAs is probably where we'll operate.
We have a number of issues out there that are coming into call periods into 2025. And so there could be some
opportunities to refinance just like we did this year. There are some very interesting refinance opportunities to

lower our preferred coupon that we're paying on the preferred capital. So that's something we'll keep an eye on as
we go forward into 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And sorry, just wanted to follow up on that last one, so the RWAs have been coming down and your
average earning assets have been kind of flat. I know you talked a little bit about this earlier, but is kind of flattish
on total balance sheet size, average earning assets, is that the right way to think about things going forward,
given all the moving parts on both sides of the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I mean, for 2024, I think the answer that is yes, with growing RWAs. As [ph] well as I (00:51:15) mentioned,
we have excess liquidity at June 30 and you could see the overall balance sheet being basically in the same zone
as where we are today. But the ability to basically deploy some excess liquidity into lending in the second half is
really the plan. So we would see RWAs and loans growing from June 30 to the end of the year.

Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. If I try to back into the 4Q NII number using your full year guide and the 3Q guide, it implies a
3% to 4% quarter-on-quarter increase in NII in 4Q. My question there is what do you need to see that uptick in
NII, I mean I know there is some benefit from the – on the swaps front, but do you also need to see loan growth?
Do you need to see deposit costs continuing to come down? Do you need any help from [ph] rates? (00:52:56)
Can you help us frame that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Yeah. And I'd say broadly that the majority of the increase in 4Q is really coming from net interest margin
rebounding. So just allowing all of those positive tailwinds from net interest margin across the whole platform from
Non-Core to front book, back book dynamics and all of those drivers is the majority of the increase in NII for 4Q.
However, there is a meaningful contribution expected from loan growth as well.
And we talked about loan growth earlier in the call and how all three businesses, Private Bank, Consumer and
Commercial are all expected to contribute to that in terms of how that plays out for the second half. When it
comes to just that net interest margin number, as I mentioned, Non-Core front book, back book, you also have
increase in deposits that you just heard Bruce talk about that increased, that's a better funding mix where we'll
have more deposits and less wholesale funding as you get into the second half.
You know, your other question about that, deposit pricing and the rate cut, I think we're somewhat well balanced
around whether the Fed cuts or not. We tend to have some offsetting forces there where we have some asset
sensitivity and a net floating position that benefits with rates being a little higher. But then that's often, the higher
for longer impact on deposit migration tends to keep us close to neutral.
And so whether we get a cut or not, I think we're feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter NII being a nice
rebound at a meaningful increase versus 3Q. And then the last part, I'll throw out there, is it's again, all the
initiatives and how, for example, balance sheet optimization and Private Bank are all accretive to net interest
margin on a quarterly basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would just add to that as well that, we also think that, a reminder that the Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter
for fees. So I think there could be, that rebounded NII kicking in in Q4, strong fee quarter continued discipline on
expenses, credit seemingly moving in the right direction. So, and then continued share repurchase. So you put
that all together, you could have kind of a nice uptick in the Q4 results.

That's really helpful. And then, as a follow up on the commercial middle market side, you outlined several positive
drivers for lines picking up in the back half. Does that come with higher utilization or do you need to see lower
rates for utilization to pick-up? And, maybe how does the uncertainty around the election, how is that factoring
into your conversations with clients?

Donald H. McCree A
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, what we're seeing – what we're assuming in our utilization growth is it's largely in the capital call and
subscription lines. So, we're seeing a little bit in the middle market. So, I think the middle market trend will be a
little longer. What we've seen our middle market companies do is kind of take their leverage levels down with
economic uncertainty. So, as the economy begins to show signs of stabilization or more certainty stabilization,
maybe they get a little more aggressive investing in their businesses and I was with a whole bunch of middle
market CEOs last week and every single one of them said they have renewed investment plans over the next 18
months. So, that'll take a little bit longer.
And I don't really see a massive impact of – from the election. I think you may get some market volatility based on
what someone says day in, day out. But I think the medium-term trend is intact and we are seeing I mean, the
playbook we're going to run in California and Florida, which Bruce mentioned, is going to mirror the playbook we
ran in New York, where we're having just extremely strong client acquisition as we bring experienced market
bankers onto the platform and they bring their clients with them. So, very early days but those pipelines are
building kind of literally within two months of hiring a new banker. So, they won't be huge numbers at the outset,
but they'll be another tailwind for us, I think.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Bruce, I think you talked about the expectation, the medium-term plan to shrink the CRE exposure incrementally
from here. Just want to get an idea of where you think that could settle out. I mean, right now, your commercial
real estate loans are about 130% of your risk-based capital plus reserves. Where do you think it goes from that
perspective post this expected runoff?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'd say, over the medium term, we'd probably take the pure commercial book down at least 25% and that'll
come across the asset classes. Obviously, we want to be smaller in office. Multifamily, we can lead that down a
bit since we took a big upsurge with the investors deal. We will make room for some CRE opportunities with the
Private Bankers since that's a an important part of their customer base. And so, they'll be a little bit of offset to
that. But that kind of directionally gives you a sense as to kind of what the plans are. And as I said earlier in the
call, I think we're making room for more C&I growth that we'd like to kind of flex and have a bigger loan capital
allocation to C&I and a smaller to CRE over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Okay, no, thank you. That's helpful. And related to that, my second one is on the Private Banking side. You
know, first on the deposit side, the $4 billion in deposits. I know 81% of that is commercial, 36% of that is DDA.
How much of those deposits are deposits with venture capital and private equity firms or related to that industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, of the commercial and business banking oriented deposits, the majority are from private equity and venture
firms. But I would note that it's heavily led by operating deposits. And so, the way that the relationship actually
works is starting as their cash management operating bank, which is why the DDA and CWI percentage is so high
in the business. So, they're stable, predictable, and generally lendable deposits. So, we're pleased with the
profile.
If you think of the loans that have come in, obviously, the LDR of the Private Bank is quite low and we've got a
good amount of liquidity padding. When you look at the lendability and the deposit base to continue to drive loan
growth even within the profile, just the Private Bank. So we're pleased with the quality, that you're seeing the loan
book diversify to consumers.
The deposit book has still remained in that sort of 80/20 split. But given the pace of growth, that obviously
suggests that the consumer business is also growing at a pretty healthy clip. That just takes some time, and we
do expect that to catch up, and it will diversify over time to more of a 60/40, maybe over the longer term horizon
50/50, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
With both deposits and loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Both deposits and loans. And the higher rates have held back on mortgage, obviously. And then the business
banking commercial deposit growth is quicker and lumpier. But we do expect that to continue to change over time.

And we're pleased with the strength of the consumer opening these Private Banking offices, which should attract
more of a high-net-worth individual as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, thank you. And then one last one would be if you could just maybe update us on the likelihood of additional
team hires on the Private Banking side and then the wealth AUM going up to about $3.6 billion there. I know you
acknowledged that might be a tougher [ph] log (01:01:26) and but it looks like towards the end of the quarter, you
had a big jump in AUM. Just curious if you could give a little bit of color around what's driving that recent upturn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll start and then pass it to Brendan, but I just want to make an overriding point is that we want to
demonstrate that we can run this as a profitable business. And so, when we initiated the launch of the Private
Bank, we put some markers out there as to what we were going to do this year, hitting breakeven in the fourth
quarter, and then next year getting to numbers that had $9 billion of loans, $10 billion of AUM, $11 billion of
deposits, that translates to 5% accretion to our bottom line.
And so, we're still building the business. We're building the service levels. We're making investments in more
support people. And we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We want to get that right. We want to
get that flywheel running and hit those numbers before we start going crazy, making investments in other regions
and other opportunities. Having said that, if there are particularly unique situations that we can kind of fit in and
execute over the next 18 months that are important locations and they don't affect our ability to hit the numbers,
we'll be open to that.
And then the other thing is, on the wealth management side, we had a strong base with Clarfeld. We knew
ultimately that we were going to have to expand the capabilities that we had by bringing in more teams. And the
focus has been at geographically situated teams that can be contiguous with the Private Banking teams that
we've set up in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Florida. And so, so far, we've been able to bring two great
teams, like quality, everything, one in San Francisco, one in Boston. That's accounting for a big chunk of that rise
in AUM with more to transfer in from their customer base. So, we have momentum there.
We also have a ton of folks interested in joining our platform. So, we can have those conversations and keep
bringing those wealth teams in because they don't really impact the near-term financials negatively. They usually
come in around breakeven with an opportunity to quickly turn into profitability. So, Brendan, you can add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, you nailed it. So, I'll repeat what you said. I would just say on the wealth side, we'll be very selective on the
banking expansion until not only we have confidence in hitting the financials, but also it's still built, and we're very
pleased with how the book to build is going and we're attracting clients. The market is still quite disrupted, both on
the client side as well as the talent side. But we're going to be very thoughtful and make sure that we're only
attracting the highest of quality teams, and we're being very selective on that.
On the wealth side, I would just say, look, for really the first time in our history, I think our right to win in Private
Wealth is at an all-time high. And there's a lot of inbounds we're getting from some of the highest quality advisors
in the market. We're also being very selective there. I'd remind you all that we have long been on the hunt for

scale here, and we've looked at a lot of acquisitions. We've obviously done one or two over the years, but the
economics have been a little out of reach with 10-plus-year paybacks on tangible book value when you're buying
RIAs given the multiples that some of the private equity firms are paying.
So, the economics of the talent acquisition are significantly more attractive to us, obviously with the de minimis
tangible book value hit and to Bruce's point, there's not really a large J-curve in the short term. So, we're very
pleased with the inbounds and talent that we're getting. We expect to continue to selectively add top end market
wealth talent to really round out the bankers that we hired. So, we're looking forward to a strong second half of the
year there.

Hi.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John, you talked and you gave us good detail about the office portfolio, commercial real estate. I think you said
that some of your assumptions in the bottom left-hand corner of slide 14 show that this downturn is far worse than
historical downturns. Can you share with us two ideas or two answers? First is, when you look back, I think you
guys have been aggressively attacking this portfolio for just over a year now. When you look back at those early
workouts in the second quarter of 2023, how are the assumptions that you're using then compare to today?
And then second, and I'm with Bruce that maybe this office problem doesn't resolve itself until sometime next
year. What are you seeing incrementally in terms of valuations or losses? Is it still deteriorating in office or has it
just stabilized, and we just got to work through these portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll go ahead and start off, Gerard. I mean, I think that earlier that what's evolved over the last year or so
has been our outlook with respect to valuations and NOI and what the rent rollovers would, actually entail and at
what speed we would see deterioration. So, of course our reserve levels are higher now than they were a year

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
ago. You know, every quarter we endeavor to put a ring fence around our exposures and give it our best attempt
at forecasting what we think the evolution will be and valuations and NOI.
I'd say that, yeah, this quarter we've done that again and we feel like we've leaned in with this 11.1%, which really
when you look at the property valuations peak to trough that 72% has grown over the last year and that those
have been the main drivers for why after charging off, we still end up with this reserve of 11.1%.
But I'd say that, was there still a lot of uncertainty left, but I think that variability – we're hopeful that the variability
in this will start to decline as we continue to work through our maturities and have conversations with our
borrowers and extract additional collateral and work through paydowns where we can. This will be a multi-quarter
event, and it'll take into 2025 [indiscernible] (01:08:27)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just add that I do think the Fed is starting to move rates lower that will certainly be a help here. So, part of
the reason the losses ended up higher than what potentially we thought back in early 2023, just those cap rates
going up, we had inflation that was impacting NOI and things like that.
And so, I think we've seen inflation now leveling off. And if the Fed starts to move rates down, that could also start
to move things in the other direction. It's too early to call a victory here, but there are some positive signs. And I
think lease up rates generally are, actually holding or potentially getting a little better as return to office picks up.
But that, again, that's not that significant in the big scheme of things.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. Okay. Then, as a follow up, you guys talked a lot about, private equity and you've, in your slide
17, you show some great numbers. Obviously, you're number one in the sponsor business and your capital
markets business is benefiting from that. So, the question I have is and it's not on the capital call or subscription
lines, but it seems over the years for banks to win in this capital markets business with sponsors, you have to use
your balance sheet to win this business. You've got to lend money to the sponsors.
So, can you share with us your exposure to, I guess, one of the line items and one of the regulatory reports is
non-depository financial lenders that, you lending to them. Can you share with us your exposure there, how you
manage that risk? Because it seems like the banking industry has been de-risked, but maybe it's in the private
credit side and the indirect exposure for the industry could come through that channel. Can you give us some
color there, Bruce or Don? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Hey, Gerard, why don't I take that, it's Don. So, we bank the private capital sector in several different ways.
We obviously have capital call and subscription lines, which are based on the LPs. We have financing lines to
some of the private credit organizations which are kind of structured as almost like asset-backed lending, where
we have diversified pools of loans underneath it and we have advance rates and the like. So, it's actually relatively
safe, almost investment grade like lending, even if those complexes begin to take some losses on their
underwriting portfolios.
So, we like those two businesses a lot. We're probably not going to grow them too much more across the entirety
of the company because it is a large concentration already. But when you look at that, those non-bank financial
numbers that includes insurance companies, there's a whole bunch of other exposures in there also.
And then, of course, we land the riskiest stuff we do is to the underlying leveraged buyouts. And our strategy
there forever has been very large holds, it's an underwrite to distribute business. If the average outstanding is like
$12 million on a given deal so, very diversified across a large group of leverage credit.
The book is actually shrinking given the lack of market activity over the last, kind of year and a half or so. So, we
feel like we're very well diversified and I've been doing this business, as you know, for a very long time. And
where you get really hurt as when you have big concentrations in leveraged loans and we see that with some of
our competition, but we're not going to go there just because that's the way we run those businesses. So those
are the really big [ph] parts. (01:12:16)

Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. One moment while
we open your line, Mr. O'Connor. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you, good morning. Can you guys talk about how you think deposits will price down? I guess the first kind
of, call it, two or three Fed cuts versus a more sustained reduction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sure. I'll take that. I mean, think what we – what we're likely to see under the first couple of cuts, we're
modeling out approximately 20% to 30% down betas in those first couple of cuts. The way the forwards have it
playing out over the longer – longer those cuts are in place, the more there's the opportunity to see rollovers of
CDs, etcetera, and to lean in and price down. So, the fact that we have, I think the forwards get down to around
4% by the end of 2025 and may start to get into the 3.50% range in terms of our outlook, when you get out into
2026 and beyond.
Through that full tightening cycle, we think that the full round trip could be – could approach – the down betas
could approach where our up betas were, our up beta is around 51%. I think the down beta could get up to that
level over the full cycle, but it'll be 20% to 30% for the first couple.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then thoughts on does deposit growth pick up a bit for I guess, the industry and you've got some
specific initiatives, obviously. But do you see pickup in kind of broader deposit trends as well with some price
cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I, yeah I mean, I think broadly we believe we're going have deposit growth in the second half contributing
from all three of our businesses. And so 2Q is a seasonally down quarter, we saw that and we were expecting
that plus all of our initiatives that we have in place are going to contribute to deposit growth in the second half.
We've got that one cut in September and our outlook that'll be helpful. I don't think that is absolutely necessary to
have that cut in order to continue to have deposit growth. But certainly, it would be helpful to get that deposit
growth to stop, kind of the migration aspects and the mix shifts that the industry has been seeing.
And then, as you broaden that out and when we have overall deposit growth and average deposits are higher,
that'll be consistent with a very positive funding mix because wholesale funding can be lower in terms of funding
the balance sheet, and that's a tailwind for NII and NIM into the second half as well.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Yeah, I would just add color there is that, the uptick in Private Bank deposits in the quarter was $1.6 billion. And
so you can see that we're really got a cadence and a rhythm in terms of kind of growing the book there in the
Private Bank and bringing in the customer base. So, we would expect to have, again, something that most other
banks don't have to drive deposit growth in having that unique business opportunity.
And then there's generally some seasonality that's favorable in the consumer, in the commercial business. So I
think the outlook for deposits growth in the second half is pretty, pretty solid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The one point I would add on the consumer side is that we've a number of years in a row where we've
outperformed on a relative basis on DDA and low cost deposits. And with benchmarking that we see so far this
year, we believe we're number one in the peer set and consumer for relative DDA performance and we see that
continuing. So, we think the trends have stabilized, so much of our deposit strategy is grounded in the health of
our DDA base. And we expect whatever the market throws us that we'll continue to outperform peers and we've
been doing that for a long time now and certainly this year has been a real strength,
