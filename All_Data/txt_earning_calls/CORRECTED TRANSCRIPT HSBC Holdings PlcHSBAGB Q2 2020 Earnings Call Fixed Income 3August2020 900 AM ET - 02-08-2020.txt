MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the today's HSBC
Q2 Fixed Income Results Conference Call. At this all participants are in a listen-only mode. There'll be some
opening remarks followed by question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I must advise you that this
conference is being recorded today.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker, Ewen Stevenson. Please go ahead.

Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning or good afternoon all. This is Ewen here the Group's CFO. I'm joined today by Iain MacKinnon, our
Group Treasurer who is actually joining by phone from a different location, and Greg Case, our Head of Fixed
Income Investor Relations. There's a fixed income specific slide deck available on our website but we don't plan
to speak to specific slides as part of these introductory comments. We'll keep the comments brief and I know
you'd all have had a chance or will have the chance to listen to the equity call that Noel Quinn and I did earlier
today.
I will try to quickly run through what we announced today and then hand over to Iain MacKinnon for more detail on
capital and funding before opening up for any questions you have. Firstly, a few words on the current
environment. Yeah, we clearly continue to be in a very unpredictable environment, but I think we've responded
well, and we continue to do what we can to support the customers and colleagues through what is an
exceptionally difficult period. I think in that context we are satisfied with how our business is performing. Asia has
held up well for us and within global banking and markets the fixed income business delivered a very strong
revenue growth in the second quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 03-Aug-2020
Businesses that performed less well are largely in areas that we've already committed to change, where we'll be
accelerating our transformation in the second half. The bank remains strong and resilient with excellent funding
and liquidity positions and our core tier 1 improved to 15% in the quarter.
Turning to the second quarter results themselves, given the impact of COVID-19, the second quarter was tough
financially. We had an 82% fall and reported profit before tax and a 57% drop in adjusted profit before tax. Our
results were heavily impacted by lower revenues which came from a combination of subdued customer activity in
many parts of our business and the building effect of ultralow interest rates. It was the second quarter in a row of
very high expected credit losses and we also had a $1.2 billion software intangible write-off, largely as a result of
the weak return outlook for the non-ring-fenced bank.
On revenues, adjusted revenues were down 4%, which included a $507 million benefit from volatile items, which
in part reversed some of the negative impacts we saw from mark-to-market movements in the first quarter.
Expected credit losses were up on the first quarter, $3.8 million in total, or 148 basis points of gross loans, with
the largest impact seen in the UK geographically and in commercial banking amongst our three global
businesses.
UK expected credit losses were $1.1 million higher than the first quarter, reflecting the worsening economic
outlook for the UK, of which $900 million related to our UK ring-fenced bank. Stage 3 expected credit losses were
broadly stable at around $1.5 billion in both the first and second quarters, although the first quarter included
significant charge on a single corporate exposure in Singapore.
Recognizing the deterioration that we saw in the economic outlook in the second quarter, we've updated our
range for the full-year group expected credit losses to $8 billion to $13 billion. The lower end reflects the path
closest to our consensus central economic scenario, reflecting a strong economic rebound in 2021, with some
unwinding of the economic adjustments taken to-date. The higher end of the range reflects the path closer to our
downside economic scenario, with a much more muted economic recovery in 2021, leading to further negative
ECL adjustments for forward economic guidance in the second half.
I'd caution that there remains a wide range of potential outcomes including the risks that the upper end of this
range may need to increase further. And in that respect, I'd encourage you to read ECL sensitivities in the Interim
Report.
As we look out to the second half, there remains considerable uncertainty whether that be from the continuing
impact of COVID-19, the ongoing Brexit negotiations, or the US-China tensions and the impact that has on our
Hong Kong franchise. As such, it's too early to discuss distribution policy or medium-term return targets, and we
don't expect to do so until our full-year 2020 results in February.
However, we're pleased that we phased into this uncertainty with a strengthened core Tier 1 ratio with 15%, an
extra $85 billion in customer deposits through the second quarter, continued vigor in managing our cost base
down, down 7% Q2-on-Q2, and the benefit of a diversified portfolio of franchises globally.
Noel and I remain very committed to the plan we announced in February, namely a mature reduction in RWAs
particularly focused on the US the non-ring-fenced bank, and Global Banking and Markets with a reallocation of
these RWAs towards our strongly performing Asian franchise. Secondly, a significant reduction in the operating
cost base of the bank; and thirdly, a mature reduction in the ongoing operating complexity of the bank.
With that, I'll pass it over to Iain to run through the balance sheet.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 03-Aug-2020
Iain MacKinnon
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. And hi, everyone, Iain here. Thanks for dialing in. Despite the weak macro environment, the balance
sheet metrics continued to remain very strong and improve. Our CET1 ratio was up 40 basis points to 15% in the
quarter and our fully loaded CET1 ratio was 14.9%. Customer deposits grew by $85 billion, resulting in a loan-to-
deposit ratio of 66.5%. That's down 5.5 percentage points since the start of the year.
The group remains very liquid with those high-quality liquid assets of over $780 billion on hand. That's up $138
billion from the end of last year. Our consolidated liquidity coverage ratio on the European Delegated Act basis
was 148%, that's purely flat in the half.
With regard to the 2020 issuance plan, you'll have noted our gross and net issuance is significantly down in 2020
versus prior years. We did expect this. We did say we would remain flat. We did successfully tender for $3.3
billion of 2021 bullet securities, while issuing $3.5 billion of new 5- or 10-year callable paper, managing their next
year C financing needs. This year, we continue to expect to keep our net issuance around zero in MREL Senior.
Our Tier 2 remains zero. Our Tier 2 need will remain zero. We don't expect to grow the balance over AT1s.
With that, I'll hand back to Ewen.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel David,
Autonomous.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dan David Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi there. Thanks for taking my – thanks for the call and thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just looking at
your issuance plans, as you said it looks like mostly refi in HoldCo Senior and AT1. Looking ahead at your
maturity profile, you obviously got [indiscernible] (09:41) maturing in 2022. On HoldCo Senior, would you look to
pre-finance any of that $15 billion that's rolling off alongside with $9 billion in 2021? And on AT1 can we assume
that you'll run at the level of AT1 you've got now? And also, are there any changes to Tier-1 type of leverage that
we should think about when considering your AT1 plans?
Second question is just on LIBOR transition. Can you give us a bit of an update on how you're progressing? Are
there any products that you think might be the kind of transition effort and also how are you thinking about the
DISCOs in the context of LIBOR transition? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Iain, do you want to start with that. We've got Greg here too, who can pick up.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 03-Aug-2020
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On the 2022 refinancing, yes, we are looking ahead. And we will take the temperature on that as we go
through the end of this year and early next year and probably look to do some refinancing a bit like we've done
now, but it very much depends on market conditions and appetite.
With regard to the AT1, I think we're not expecting to extend it. With regards to – extent the base of our AT1 with
regard to the double leverage with the fallback in – on the cessation of the dividend, double leverage is running at
or about risk appetite. So, we're actually seeing nothing untoward that. And then on the final point maybe hand
over to maybe hand over to Greg, but I don't feel I can really comment on the DISCOs at the moment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Case A
Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah sure. Thanks, Iain. It's Greg here. So as a general point on LIBOR, I think we're aligned with the industry on
this. I think we're very keen to move toward the new standards and we've been doing that with our most recent
issuance. And we're looking at what opportunities we'll have to make sure that we're as compliant as we can be
and want to be working with the investment community to ensure that we're getting the right outcomes in time, but
obviously, still got plenty of time to work that through.
Specifically on the DISCOs, we're not going to talk to individual bonds. We don't want to give any kind of legal
analysis, but our main intention where we can is to try and remediate bonds and move over to new reference
rates where we can.

Dan David Q

Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fenner, Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Can you hear me?

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Oh, hi. And thanks for taking my question. I got two quick ones. First, I didn't quite – just to be completely clear,
are you still aiming to issue AT1 this year to cover what you redeemed earlier or is that now off the table for the
remainder of 2020? That's question number one.
And the question number two, and I'm sorry if I missed it on the main call this morning. What I think is apparent is
the transformation program is fixing things that investors are – have become more or less comfortable with, at

least in terms of the uncertainty and the – what people are worried about are the businesses that have typically
gone okay in Asia. And so, I certainly put the [ph] recent (13:29) HSBC underperformance in bond land. I can only
think that that's because people are worried about what's going on in China, [ph] Hong Kong (13:42) what is it that
you can tell us about [indiscernible] (13:49-13:55)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Maybe I can answer the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sorry, I think we missed the last of the question at the end there. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Sorry, sorry, yeah. Hello?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, we just missed up the question at the very end there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Oh, yeah. So my question with investors, that's what they're kind of worried about and I'm never quite sure what it
is that I can tell them, I know it's not in your – you're not political analysts, you're not economists, but you can tell
us something about where you think foreign policy in the US, in the UK, in the European Union, vis-à-vis China,
Hong Kong where that could impact your business most readily and – so we can kind of just to start to factor in
some potential downside risks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, I don't think we're going to sit on call and probably speculate about the foreign policy position of
various governments around the world. I mean, all I can point to, as I said earlier on the call, was if you look at the
underlying financial performance of whether it was Hong Kong business which was continuing to [ph] attract
deposit (15:11) flow in Q2, the China business which profits were up materially in Q2. It's very hard to point to
anything that's having any material impact on our business at the moment as a result of geopolitical tension. So –
but we're not speculate on the position of various government foreign policy around the world. On the first one, on
AT1 issuance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, Paul, no plans to refinance that call that we made In January and we're happy with where the Tier 1
capital moved to after that. So, as we look out over the course of the next kind of 12, 18 months we've got, our
next new style AT1 call is not until next summer so we'll have to look at that as and when. Clearly, we've got the
legacy Tier 1 capital credit starting to roll off. And obviously, we'll think about how we look at that in the future and
6

whether or not we refinance that, but if we were to issue any AT1, it would be to refinance rather than anything
else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
I'm sorry. [ph] And not going to happen (16:20) this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think we wouldn't rule it out. But at this stage, there's nothing immediately planned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Fenner-Leitão Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley, UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for doing the call. Just a couple of quick questions as you've covered a lot already this morning and in
the earlier call. Just in general, loan loss provisioning, a number of your peers have said that they feel that they're
around peak provisioning, you're – seem to be indicating that you're going to have similar levels at least in the
third quarter. Could you talk about – just give us an idea around that and where you think that's going to come
from? Secondly, on liquidity, could you give us, if possible, a breakdown on – because I'm looking at slide 9,
you've got it by division, could you give us a breakdown geographically how much of that liquidity is in the UK for
example and how much do you need to there around changing economic circumstances in Brexit?
And then, third, I just want to be clear on issuance on page 18, as a gross number roughly how much HoldCo
Senior are you looking to issue in – for the remainder of 2020? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. It's not what we said in relation to ECLs. The – we indicated – in the first-half of the year, we had just under
$7 billion of ECLs and for the second-half of the year, we've indicated a range of $8 billion to $13 billion for the
full-year which mathematically implies somewhere between $1 billion and $6 billion for the second-half. So, I don't
think we're indicating that we continue to naturally expect the third quarter to see the same run rate that we saw in
the first two quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
The – I think the key determinant will be – yeah, as we go into third quarter will be is there any material shift in
forward economic guidance? So – and I think unlike some of our peers and I know a couple of UK peers last
7


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 03-Aug-2020
week talked about much lower sensitivity, but they would [ph] caveat that there's (19:23) no change and forward
economic guidance. That's not what we've said. We've acknowledged the fact that there could be changes in the
forward economic guidance and hence why we have come out with a broader range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Iain MacKinnon A
Group Treasurer, HSBC Holdings Plc
Rob, so on the LCR, and we've given that the ratios on the slide, there's more detail in the Interim Report. So, you
can see the HQLA by entity on page 82 of the Interim Report we put out this morning, that should give you more
insight.
On the issuance plan in terms of gross HoldCo Senior, well, I think when we set out the plan at the start of the
year, we obviously had in mind that we were looking to do the liability management that we undertook, and that's
why we were very clear with our guidance that it was a refinancing. And so, if you look out at what we've got to
deal with that for the rest of the year, we've got about $3 billion, $3.5 billion of HoldCo Senior that matures this
year or is callable this year, sorry. And subject to those calls being made, then we'll probably look at refinancing
them, but it's – that's not even necessarily going to be 100% of the case either.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. That's very helpful. Appreciate the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] (20:46) RBC. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi there. Thanks for taking the call. Just one from me, please, more on the payment holiday and the
[indiscernible] (21:01). When you think of the stock of loans which made to Stage 2, I understand that these do
not include the long-term payment holiday. When you think of these – both of these categories Stage 2 and
payment holidays, which one do you think is riskier? Can you give us some sort of idea about what are your
thoughts behind the risk [indiscernible] (21:27)? Where do you expect more losses to materialize over the next, I
don't know 6, 12 months? And anything would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, I guess, within the [indiscernible] (21:42) all of that, I mean, you're clearly having to make significant
assumptions in terms of likely impairments against those payment holidays when they roll off, I guess, we'll learn
a lot more in the next one to three quarters as they do. But we have built in assumptions into that range of $8
billion to $13 billion that we came out with. For example in the UK, there's very big judgment calls, for example, on
where [indiscernible] (00:22:17) unemployment go post of the end of the furlough scheme, which then rolls
through to whether that would stretch or what degree of stretch that puts on payment holidays. But we set out on
page 67 of Interim Report, yeah, some fairly detailed analysis of what relief we've given and where. And you can
make your own assumptions on that as – in terms of the [ph] type of loss ratio we'd factor in both. (22:49) We
have made our adjustments and coming out with the $8 billion to $13 billion range.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Lee Street, Citigroup.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Strategist, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hello. Good afternoon, all. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got a couple of questions on Stage 2 and then
one on ratings. Just on Stage 2, there seems to be quite a significant increase in the Stage 2 balances, which
mostly coming from corporate and commercial lending. So, I'm just trying to understand what's driving this. Is this
fundamental in terms of a real greater risk or this HSBC being a bit more conservative in the way they're doing
IFRS 9 and so moving things from Stage 1 to Stage 2, because we're not necessarily seeing a uniform movement
across all banks? That's number one.
And number two, linked to that and a little bit like the last question, obviously, there's quite big discrepancy at the
moment between Stage 2 balances and Stage 2 balances that are actually past due, which I'm guessing
obviously coming from the payment moratoria. So how would you recommend that we go about looking at an
understanding what proportion of Stage 2 balances are likely going to actually move into Stage 3, because
obviously, that's the key question?
And just finally on Moody's, I'm presuming you have a regular interaction with them. Any thoughts or comments
on the risk [ph] you'll obtain from (24:26) Moody's downgrade for you basically? That'd be my three questions.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, on the last one, I don't think we're going to speculate what Moody's may or may not do and it's probably a
question that's better directed at them. On Stage 2, I mean, it's mainly the deterioration in forward economic items
that we've seen. If you go from end of April when we announced Q1 results and run through week-on-week
through to about mid-July, what we saw is a steady deterioration in the economic outlook for the global economy
and more pronounced in some places such as the UK, almost week on week.
And [ph] it only grew, (25:10) began to stabilize in July, i.e., that the trough of what people thought for 2020, we
did see some uplift on economic recovery in 2021, but not enough to offset the sharpness of the V or the
recessionary event is 2020. Yeah, I mean, you obviously have to run your own [indiscernible] (25:35), it's a very
complicated set of judgements that you need to make in this environment given the models haven't seen any
events like those. So yeah, the models are probably less predictive and reliable particularly when you get to more
extreme ends of downside scenarios.
We have had effects in underlays as a result of which set out the – you're trying to factor in the impact of
government support packages and when those government support packages roll-off, what is going to be the
impact on credit. And yes, so all of that thinking has been factored into the best extent we can and coming up with
the $8 billion to $13 billion range. And we tried to give you as much details as we can to allow you to take different
assumptions and applying different probabilities to our various scenarios as set out in our Interim Report.

Okay. And just a quick follow-up sir, just in terms of your Stage 2, because I guess Stage 2 can importantly
incredibly high-quality credits, we've seen a slight deterioration in probability [ph] fell as well as near term from
(26:52) much riskier. Is there any commentary you can give around sort of, is that the case, is it high quality stuff
that's flowing up the balances in Stage 2, or is it just a mix?
