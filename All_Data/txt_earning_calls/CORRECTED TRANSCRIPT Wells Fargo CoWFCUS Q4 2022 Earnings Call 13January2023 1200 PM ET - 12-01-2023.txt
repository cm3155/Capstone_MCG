I will now turn the call over to Charlie.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter results and then update you on our
priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail and some of our
expectations for 2023 before we take your questions.
Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed
operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve
returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency
initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both our commercial and
consumer portfolios and charge-offs have continued to increase, but credit quality remained strong. Our capital
levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well-above our required minimums plus
buffers.
We also continued to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad-reaching agreement with the
CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have
been outstanding for several years. Over the past three years, we have made significant changes in the
businesses referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete
prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have
more to do, we've made significant progress and we will continue to prioritize our work here.
In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off
the great market positions we have. We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk
and control work, at the same time that we invest in our future.
And as I look back in 2022, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better
about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of
customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-
sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection.
Early Pay Day, making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. Extra Day Grace, giving eligible
customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. And in the fourth quarter, we launched
Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access
to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout
has been smooth. And though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations.
These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking,
our account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We
continued to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We
continue to improve our credit card offerings, including launching two new cards: Wells Fargo Autograph and
BILT. Our new products help drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022 while we continued to
maintain strong credit profiles.
We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing
together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and
integrated offering for our clients. We continued to enhance partnership within our commercial business to bring

corporate investment banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-
market clients.
Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out
our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction. In
2022, mobile app to customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for
customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment, and total
active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago.
We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized,
convenient, and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling
out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for
our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive
platform based on our clients' specific needs.
Over the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for
commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramped up and
grew product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing
heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native
operating model that allows us to innovate faster. We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of
payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end-to-end. These
enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital
transformation.
We're also continuing to evaluate our existing businesses. As we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a
more focused Home Lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers, as well as individuals and
families in minority communities. This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our
servicing portfolio. I've been saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the
financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability,
returns, and serving minority communities, not volume or market share. The mortgage product is important to our
customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us. But we do not need to be one of
the biggest originators or servicers in the industry to do this effectively. Across all of our businesses, we must
evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. While it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the
decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus will – this will actually
enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term.
Changing gears now. I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social, and
governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our
stakeholders will enhance returns for shareholders, and we provide many examples on slide 2 of our presentation
so let me just highlight two examples here.
We published our first diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our
DE&I initiatives. We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&I into every aspect of the
company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, who joined Wells Fargo in 2020 to lead our Home Lending
business and was named the company's new Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion in the
fourth quarter. We've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results
of the assessment by the end of this year.

2022 was a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its
priority and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal. We are starting to see the impact on
consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services. At this point, the impact to consumers
and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of
consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially –
I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This, plus the strength
with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy, is a helpful set of facts as we look
forward.
Our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending, and credit quality, still stronger
than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our
customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels.
While we are not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company
today than one and two years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we're better managed, and our
capital position is strong, so we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we
currently see or predict. We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our
efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology
and product enhancements.
Two years ago, we shared a path to a higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on
our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of 2022 impacted our results, our
underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns. In a moment, Mike will highlight
the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our
business model and our ability to execute.
While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control
infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time
and resources necessary.
I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to
make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers,
communities, and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So, I'm going to start with our fourth
quarter financial results on slide 4.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, or $0.67 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results
included $3.3 billion or $0.70 per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed
historical matters including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation, $1 billion of impairment of equity
securities or $749 million after non-controlling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business,
primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both slowing revenue growth rates and
lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations. It's important to note that
even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above
the amount of the initial investment.

$353 million of severance expense primarily in Home Lending, while we've reduced head count in this business
throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement
we made earlier this week. These reductions were partially offset by $510 million of discrete tax benefits related to
interest on overpayments in prior years.
We highlight capital on slide 5. Our CET1 ratio is 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter,
reflecting the benefit from our fourth quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching
contribution, and an increase from AOCI. Our CET1 ratio remained well-above our required regulatory minimum
plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital
buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. While we have not repurchased
any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first
quarter this year.
Turning to credit quality on slide 7, credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in
the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows and we expect them to
continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to
combat high inflation.
Credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 6 basis points of net charge-offs
in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased $88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis
points of average loans driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the Credit Card portfolio, but remain slightly
below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. Nonperforming assets increased 1% from the
third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real
estate nonaccrual loans.
Our allowance for credit losses increased $397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth, as
well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are
continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.
Let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios. The size of our Auto portfolio has declined for three consecutive
quarters, and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations
were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, which reflected credit tightening actions and
continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Of note, our new vehicle origination surpassed used
vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the
industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth.
Turning to the Commercial Real Estate office portfolio, the office market is showing signs of weakness due to
weak demand driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance, as well as challenging
economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do
expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being
disciplined in our underwriting standards with both outstanding balances and credits down compared to a year
ago.
On slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and $3.1 billion from third
quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios
and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our
Auto portfolio.

I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields
increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from third quarter reflecting the higher rate
environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago and 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the
third quarter, we saw declines in each of our businesses. Lower consumer balances reflected customers
continuing to reallocate cash and higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in wealth and investment management
and continued consumer spending.
As expected, our average deposit costs increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points, driven
by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs
were up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021 while market rates have increased substantially more
during that same time. As rates continued to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase and
customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products to continue.
Turning to net interest income on slide 9. Fourth quarter net interest income was $13.4 billion, which was 45%
higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details in our 2023
expectations later on the call.
Turning to expenses on slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from the third
quarter was driven by higher operating losses. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat
from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued
progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the
December 2022 CFPB consent order. As part of that settlement, we agreed to one incremental remediation and
one new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these two remediations was approximately
$350 million.
Our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions. And reflecting these
accruals, our current estimate of the high-end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our accrual
for legal actions as of December 31, 2022 is approximately $1.4 billion. This is down approximately $2.3 billion
from September 30, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation to resolve, this estimate would be the lowest
level since the second quarter of 2016, though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop
over time. The estimate for December 31, 2022 will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may
change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past two quarters have been
significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb these
costs while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier.
Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11. Consumer and
Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates.
Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new
product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees. A majority of
the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth quarter run rate.
We've continued to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers has
steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to
continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs.
While industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the
beginning of the year. And weekly mortgage applications, as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association,
7

were at a 26-year low at quarter-end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited, and refinance
applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago. Reflecting these market
conditions, our Home Lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago driven by lower mortgage originations and
gain on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization
pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging, and gain on sale margins were
made under pressure until excess capacity in the industry has been removed. As we announced this week, we
will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first
quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results.
Credit Card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale
volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread
compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas, as well as lower loan balances.
Personal Lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread
compression. While originations grew 19% from a year ago, driven by strong consumer demand and investments
in the business we have remained disciplined in our underwriting.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32%
from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of
total originations were over half of our volume a year ago, but declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022.
I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in Auto originations, so turning to debit card, spending was up 1%
compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower
transaction volume offset by higher average ticket size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit
spending, while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods, and fuel were all down compared to
2021.
Credit card spending increased 17% from a year ago. And while the year-over-year growth rates slowed from the
third quarter, almost all categories continued to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a
year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but were still well above pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 78% from a year
ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-Based
Lending and Leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities
partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.
While growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher line utilization, utilization rates stabilized in the second
half of the year. Average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third
quarter with growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing, driven by continued growth in client inventory, which
are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in Middle Market Banking was driven by larger clients, including both
new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 14. Banking revenue increased 22% from year ago driven
by stronger Treasury Management results due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as improved Lending
results. Investment Banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all
products and industries. Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger Lending
results due to higher balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a
year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates, and commodities, foreign exchange, and municipal
products. Average loans grew 10% from a year ago. After growing for seven consecutive quarter, average loans
declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios.

On slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago as the increase in
net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the
decrease in market valuations. The majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so
asset-based fees should increase slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of
the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact
of efficiency initiatives. Even as loan growth and securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by
market volatility and the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year-ago.
Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year
of our Corporate Trust business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth
quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of $943 million. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to low
results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments of equity
securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago is driven by higher operating losses.
Turning to our expectations for 2023 starting on slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net
interest income. We are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right
on the waterfall, based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our interest income will continue to benefit
from the impact of higher rates even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022. However, this benefit is
expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these
declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind from lower CIB Markets net interest
income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in training
gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small.
Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus
2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of
which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances,
mix and pricing, and the loan demand.
Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $57.3
billion of noninterest expense in 2022, which included $7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses,
expenses would have been $50.3 billion, which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last
year, if you also exclude operating losses from the guidance.
Our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense. However, revenue-related
expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. So, we believe a good starting point for discussion of
2023 expenses is $50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by
approximately $1 billion due to both merit increases, including inflationary pressures, and an approximately $250
million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge.
These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately $100 million of lower revenue-related
expense, primarily driven by decreases in Home Lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-
related expense in Wealth and Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022.
We successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past
two years. And through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional $3.2 billion of gross expense
reductions in 2023. A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more
9

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
focused Home Lending business, but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time
to be realized.
We highlight on the slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year and believe we'll have more
opportunities beyond 2023. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control were
separate from our efficiency initiatives, and we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this
important work. And while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to
invest and expect approximately $1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie
discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our ability to track growth across the company and better serve
our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year.
So putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat in 2023
compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge and increase in the incremental
investments in our businesses.
As 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict and, therefore, we have not
included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related
operating losses such as fraud, theft and other business as usual losses to be approximately $1.3 billion this year,
which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation,
regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses. It's important to
note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant
opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving
an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix.
Given how critical continuing to invest into our story, on slide 19, we provided details on our primary areas of
focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top
priority and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we've
started to make in digital and payments. We plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make
improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers.
We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage in Investment Banking, Commercial Banking,
Wealth and Investment Management, and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving
more applications to the cloud, consolidating our data centers and increasing investments in cyber.
Finally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience but
also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk and drive account growth.
As we show on slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE, but as I highlighted at the start of the
call, our fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated
impairments of equity securities, severance and discrete tax benefits.
As we show on this slide, if you exclude these notable items, our fourth quarter ROTCE would have been
approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the
following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding
balances, mix and pricing. Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels.
If rates, funding balances, mix and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher,
our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different
10


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
answer. So to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and credit costs are lower than our long-term
expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns.
On slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns. Since we first discussed our ROTCE goals in the earnings
call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed a number of important items. We executed on $20 billion of
gross common stock repurchases, $16 billion when you net issuances, including our 401(k) plan. We increased
our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately $7.5 billion of gross
expense saves and reduced head count by 11% since the end of 2020.
So we've made good progress over the past two years on things we can control, and we believe we have a clear
line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need
to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-
returning products and businesses. Adding more focus in our Home Lending business should also be a positive
contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives.
Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted
earlier. While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to
increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the
longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to
benefit returns, and our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers.
In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our
results, the underlying results in the quarter continued to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we
look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income, and our expenses, excluding operating losses,
are expected to be relatively flat, even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses drive growth.
Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong in the fourth quarter and we expect to resume share
repurchases in the first quarter.
We will now take your questions.

Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question of today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning – good afternoon, I should say. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year. So you
obviously had a good high end to the year at $13.5 billion FTE, and just looking at what the guide implies, implies
a step-down – a little bit of a step-down from thereafter. Can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect
the betas to move through and then like what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the
moving parts? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. I'll just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there and then,
obviously, also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. And so, as you look at the
key things, you look at [indiscernible] (00:36:48) loan growth we've got, we're expecting kind of low- to mid-single-
digit loan growth throughout the year, so not superfast pace but sort of moderate pace of loan growth.
We are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base stabilizing later in the year but some
moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters. And then we would expect the betas to continue to
move up a little from here. And then when you think about the pacing of it, the first half of the year will certainly be
higher than the second half of the year, if all of these things play out. And so, you shouldn't expect a really big
step-down in the first quarter, for sure.
And then I think that provides the opportunity, potentially, in the second half of the year, if things – if we don't see
that step-down in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected. And then I'd just point out,
even as we looked at the fourth quarter, the betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled. And so, we're
all in a little bit of uncharted territory here, but I do think that there's some opportunity potentially in the second half
of the year as we look at the forecast, but it'll be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And so, second question, heard your commentary about the $1.3 billion of op losses and the fact
that the RPLs down to – way down to $1.4 billion. Just how do you kind of help us understand your range of
confidence? Obviously last year, op losses ended at $7 billion as you made progress. So how wide is the range of
expectations around your confidence on that level of op loss for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think, if you look at what we've said over the last quarter or two, there's been roughly in the third and fourth
quarter [ph] $200 million, $250 million (00:38:49) of just BAU op losses that's happened, just fraud, theft, normal
stuff that you should expect to continue. So that gives you sort of a bottom end. And then I think the rest of it is –
12


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that we've got to work through for next
year.
But I think as you look at the RPL going from $3.7 billion to $1.4 billion, as those big items have moved to be
more probable and estimable for us, we booked them and hopefully that gives you confidence that we're putting
some of the big things behind us, but we still have stuff to work through and there'll be more over time, I'm sure,
but we've put a lot of big things behind us.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I think maybe a question along the same line there. So the
tone around the regulatory issues certainly sounds better than like 90 days ago and that reasonably possible
losses seems to give better quantitative thinking as well. But what – maybe, Charlie, what are the major touch
points sort of on your plate right now? I know all roads ultimately lead to lifting the asset cap but maybe would be
curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yes. Well, let me just – so, listen, we still have a series of consent orders, of which, and I always point this out,
the asset cap is a piece of one of them. So all roads don't lead to the asset cap. The roads in this respect lead to
us building the proper control environment, which will satisfy, ultimately, all the consent orders. And I've tried to be
clear that we are making progress on that work. It is a lot to do. And our tone hasn't changed relative to the
confidence in the progress that we're making there. So we're going to continue doing it. And hopefully, it's done to
the satisfaction of the regulators, but they'll have to decide that. And as we continue to check off the to-dos on that
work, the control environment gets better and better and we become a better-run company that doesn't have
those kinds of operating losses that you've all seen in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. And then, Mike, when you talk about resuming share repurchases in the first
quarter, maybe could you give us sort of a sense for order of magnitude and maybe just at an even higher level,
sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what seems sort of still uncertain rules out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I would start with where our CET1 ratio is at the end of the year, we're at 10.6%. So we're well above our
current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there. So we have plenty of flexibility regardless of
any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed. And keep in mind, that'll take some time to
come out and get implemented and phased in, and so there's – it's not going to happen in a day.

And I think we'll go back to what we've been saying the last number of quarters as we think about the buffer that
will put on the reg minimum of buffers of 9.2%, we'll be managing somewhere in the 100-, plus or minus a little,
basis-point range and depending on what happens with loan growth and RWA growth that we see over the
quarter, that'll help guide the share repurchases.

Hey, Mike. Wanted to clarify your answer to Ken about the first quarter NII. I think you said you do not expect a
big step-down in the first quarter. And maybe you could just frame first quarter NII a little bit for us, relative to the
$13.4 billion. What are some of the headwinds, tailwinds and what might you expect at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, no, thanks, John. Well, first, you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter. So that's going to
be a step-down of, call it, $150 million to $200 million step-down just there from less days. And then as you look –
it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter, but there could be some – a little bit of wiggle room in there.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
Okay, got it. And then, Charlie, maybe a bigger question, just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey
when we think about $50 billion of core expense for this year and the timeframe for ROTCE. What will it take? Is
there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind? Or is that too hard to forecast? Maybe a little bit on that would
be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Look, it's a good question. I think – so first of all, I think when – just make a – just a couple of comments around
the expense guidance we gave. Embedded in that expense guidance, we're still continuing to reduce the core
expenses of the company. But as you can see on that slide, we're anticipating that we will spend more money on
investments that are around technology, digital, building out products and things like that, that offset that, to some
extent, to get to an overall flat expense base.
Mike did say in his comments, and I just want to repeat it, that we're not going to spend this money at all costs.
We're going to see how the year continues to pan out. It's money that we would like to spend. We're planning to
spend it. But there's a lot of discretion in the expense base, so we think it's prudent as we sit here today to plan to
spend it, but we're going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should
be.
And so, as we look at the efficiency of the company, we do expect to continue to get efficiency ratio improvement
in the place. And if we don't see revenue growth and if we don't see payoffs from the things that we're doing, then
we will spend less money. And so, that's the way we're approaching it. We're either going to get the efficiency
ratio to continue to improve because we're getting real payoff on some things or we will reduce on a net basis. But
overall, there's still gross expenses that should come out of the company which gives us the latitude to continue to
grow the investments inside the company.
And the timing to get to 15%, listen, it's a great question. As we've talked about it, it's medium term, which is
obviously not long term or short term. But I would say, and it's – without putting a specific timeframe, it is – it
should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future. It's not something that's
theoretical. It's something that we believe we should get to. And just the problem, and we're just trying to stay a
little bit away from quantifying exactly where we're starting from just because everyone will make their own
adjustments. And it's just I think – what we're just trying to do is be really clear that we don't want to take credit for
the outperformance in NII, we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in charge-offs. And that we still
have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. So, Charlie, I was hoping to ask a follow-up to that last line of questioning around expenses.
You indicated that the expense work, it's going to continue beyond 2023. And the one metric that we've been
tracking is head count. And in terms of the benchmarking analysis that we've done, head count is down more than
10% since the 2020 peak, or roughly 30,000, but it's still elevated versus your money center peers. Was hoping
15


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
you could just speak to what inning you're in currently in terms of optimizing head count and whether – as we look
beyond 2023, whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower. You had talked about
balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains. I just want to think about the expense
trajectory beyond 2023, whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated head count still.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Listen, I think – I mean, I think your point on head count versus peers is one that we've made. And so, yes,
we are all different in terms of the businesses that we're in and what we do, but we do and – some insource and
some outsourcing things, but when you look at it, we still have higher head count and higher expenses than
people who are more complex than us. Some of that is explained by the work that we're doing, the expenses and
heads that are building out the control infrastructure, but there's a lot more beyond that. That's the work that we're
doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece. We still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the
company. We have duplicate systems, and that's the work that we're on. So when I say that we still have gross
expenses to be reduced in the company, that's exactly what we're talking about.
The question is when we get to a net basis, where does that come out? As I said before, I think that's a decision
that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of
the company is. So, again, I just want to repeat what I said. We're not going to spend under any environment at all
costs. That's not the way we're thinking about it. If we don't see net improvements in performance of the
company, we've got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved
performance of the company.
What we'd like to see is that these things are paying off. We're seeing real sustainable revenue growth based
upon these things, and the ability to invest. And so, that's just kind of how – that's the framework that we're using
to make the decisions and as we get to each point in time, and it's not even just an annual decision. I mean, Mike
and I and the operating committee have these discussions regularly about how are things panning out, what does
it look like, and how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things and have it – it's got to
be living and breathing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's helpful color, Charlie. And for my follow-up, just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback, you
guys are uniquely positioned in that you aren't migrating into a higher G-SIB bucket. Because of the asset cap,
you're not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet. And you've conveyed a
high level of confidence around the 15% ROTCE. Where your stock is trading today at least on price of tangible
reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism in your ability to get there. Just given the strength of your capital
position, why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here? Just recognizing the significant amount of
capital you'll generate, some of the concerns around AOCI seem to be abating. Would be helpful to get some
perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully closer to 100%-type payout here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, so – it just – it sounds like you're drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said we're going to buy stock
back, which I don't think we've actually said. But what we've said is, is that we haven't been buying stock back.
We anticipate we're going to begin buying it back. As we think about how much we have available in that capacity,
what Mike said was our CET1 went up to 10.6%. Our required minimums plus buffers are at 9.2%, and we had
16


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
said that we'll manage 100 basis points above the 9.2%, plus or minus. So we do have substantial capacity, plus
the ongoing earnings capacity of the company.
And so that is, that's – our framework is to target a reasonable CET1 ratio. If in the future we have to raise the
levels of capital because of Basel III endgame or whatnot, we've got earnings capacity to be able to do that. But
we do have the flexibility. And now that we've got resolution with CFPB and things like that and be able to go buy
stock back, and we'll be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock and liquidity in the
market and things like that. But as we said, we do anticipate we'll be back in – I suppose, to where we've been.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good afternoon. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side. Maybe if
you can talk a little bit more about the noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here. It
looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefits. So just want to see if you can
perhaps talk about that and then maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit
side in terms of balances overall. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. John, it's Mike. I think, overall, as I said earlier, we do expect some moderate decline in balances and some
more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year. And so, you should expect that to continue. And it's all the
stuff that should be expected as we're in this environment and that's what we're seeing. And if you look at each of
the businesses, we're seeing it kind of most acutely happen in the Wealth business, as people move into cash
alternatives out of deposits. And that's what's happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days is
people move that cash around.
And then across the rest of the consumer businesses, it's part people looking for higher yields, but it's also part
people spending more. And so you're seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to
decline, as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending. So it's a little bit of a number
of drivers there.
And I think as I said earlier, as you think about the NII pacing for this year, this first half of the year will certainly be
higher than the second half of the year given the trends that we expect to happen. And if those are a little bit
better than what we're modeling, then I think that provides some opportunity as we look at the second half of the
year.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, Mike. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, you gave some pretty good color, obviously, around
NII expectations now and then also on expenses. On the fee side, can you perhaps give us your expectation
there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where
you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the Investment Banking area, et cetera, that
would help. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure. And so as you break apart fees, the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees. And that's
going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes. So if we start to see recovery in the equity
markets at a more substantial pace, that'll obviously be a big benefit for that business. When you look at some of
the other line items, deposit fees, as I mentioned in my commentary, most of the decline that we were expecting
to see as a result of the overdraft, policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate. You
may see some pressure there related to earnings credits on the commercial side, but the run rate decline for
overdrafts is really in there.
When you think about Investment Banking fees, that's going to be somewhat market dependent. We've seen – it's
too early to know how that's going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there, but as we continue to
make the investments in our Investment Banking business over a longer period of time, we would expect to see
some growth there both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space, as
well as our other large corporate clients there. And so, a lot of that's going to be dependent on the market, but
we're confident that we're going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it.
And then we talked about mortgage. Mortgage is a small piece of the – is a much smaller piece of the puzzle than
it was today. So we don't expect that to be...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Smaller piece today than it was historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sorry, yeah, smaller piece today than it was historically. And so – and that's going to be a pretty challenging
market until – in this rate environment. So I think we – we're confident in the investments we're making that will
pay off over time, but it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through depending on the market
dynamics.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon. I just had one question. I guess, Charlie, in your opening remarks you mentioned that the
impact on customers from higher rates, I think, you implied was not getting worse with the incremental rates. Was
that the right takeaway? And if so, and if the Fed ere to stop after another hike, do you actually see that the
impact to your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last 6 to 12 months and implications of
that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book? Would love to hear – any perspective you can
share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. What I was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers
on a period-over-period basis, and we would expect that to continue. But it's not accelerating. It's much more
linear than exponential. And the fact that it's much more linear is actually a very helpful thing, because that gives
people – that just – that's a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance. It
shows that they're adjusting their spending patterns and savings patterns and borrowing patterns to adjust for the
reality of higher rates. And on your second question, we would anticipate that we would continue to see
deterioration in those metrics continue after the Fed stops raising rates for a period, just because of the amount of
time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly. So hopefully that was helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned earlier around Commercial Real Estate. Like, are
you seeing any stress? There's some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refi-ed given the move-in
rates we've seen over the last year. Any stress within the CRE book? And anything just in terms of home
[indiscernible] (01:00:01)? A lot of negative headlines [indiscernible] (01:00:04). Would love to hear your
perspective on that, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, it's Mike. I'll try to take that and Charlie can add if he needs.
When you look at the – and you're really getting at the office, I think, space more than anything there. There's
certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or two or three quarters ago, and I think you're
seeing that. Now, it hasn't translated into lost content at this point, and so we're keeping a careful eye on it. And I
think it is – as you look at where you see it most. It is in older, lower-class properties. And over 80% of our
portfolio is in Class A space, and so we feel like the quality of it's pretty good, but we will see some stress as we
go through here.
So far, it's been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places, but we are very watchful
on cities like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, like Washington DC where you're seeing lease rates overall be
much lower than other cities across the country. And so, certainly, those are markets that we're keeping a pretty
close eye on and making sure we're being proactive with our borrowers to make sure we're thinking way ahead of
any maturities or extensions, options that need to get put in place to help manage through it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Just one more clarification question, if I may, on net interest income. Mike, your underlying
assumptions to your NII outlook in terms of low-to-mid-single-digit loan growth, moderate declines in deposit
balances in the first half and stabilizing, that doesn't feel very different from what consensus had been assuming
to get to $51.5 billion for 2023, which is clearly higher than what's implied by your outlook. So, I'm wondering if I
could re-ask Ken's question.
What deposit betas, what terminal deposit betas, what range of expectations are you baking into that $49.5 billion
forecast? And did you bake a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your NII outlook? And I'm
asking that question because one of your peer CEOs said their $74 billion outlook was not conservative. So, I
think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations, I did have to re-ask that question here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No, look. It's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, let's start with the second before Mike actually goes [ph] with the facts (01:03:02).
Again, I think one of the things that you're hearing from all of us that we're all very consistent on, which I know you
appreciate but I just want to say it anyway, is we don't know what the rate path is going to look like from here over
the next 11.5 months which is exactly what you're asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going
to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with. So, you're looking at, we don't know what the
alternative's going to be in nonbank deposits and we don't know what the alternatives are going to be in bank
deposits, but we're trying to make those predictions. So, I think when we go through all of this, we're all just trying
to, in our own way, make sure that there's clarity that we're all – and I'll speak for myself now. We're trying to give
you what we think is achievable. And in our case, based upon the rate curve that we've laid out in the document,
and it might or might not turn out that way.
We're also assuming, and I've talked about this at a conference in December, that we are going to continue to
raise rates in which we pay our consumers because we're thinking about this not in terms of maximizing short-
term NII, but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for
that, so that we're continuing to recognize how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can
be to keep an existing relationship.
And so, if your views are different towards the end of the year as to what the rate scenario could be, that's fine.
Specifically, what we've tried to do as we've gotten closer to the periods with which we see is give you some

clarity as Mike did on what we're – the first quarter is a little clearer to us, but beyond that is pretty difficult, and
we're not going to go through every last beta that we're assuming in terms of what those forecasts are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And the only thing I'll add to it is when the Fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates, you will see a
lag on pricing as that will – pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or two quarters, three quarters. Really,
it all depends on the competitive environment, so you're going to have some lag there. But I'm sure all of us have
our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models, but what we're trying to give you as Charlie
said is a case that we think is achievable through the year. And as I said earlier on the call, I think if we've –
depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter, we could have some opportunity in the second
half, but I think it's unclear exactly how that'll play out, so we'll obviously keep you updated as it goes.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some follow-up questions as it
relates to the mortgage business in general there. I think you mentioned that it's not substantial impact, maybe
you could help us understand revenues, expenses, EPS. I made my own assumptions, but I get a lot of questions
from people on what management say, so would like to understand that piece of it.
And then could you help us understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business once you exit
correspondent? Is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any panel? Or are you saying with this
correspondent exit that you'll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself and the MSR will wind down over time?
Just give us some color around that. Would be appreciated. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So, I'll start on the second and then Mike can circle around to the first.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 13-Jan-2023
So, no, we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future. Again, what
we're trying to do in the path that we've laid forward is just to make very clear that we're not interested in running
and having a business which is focused on a stand-alone mortgage product. We very much appreciate the
importance of mortgage to the consumer base and we're going to continue to stay in the business, but we're
going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship. So, that means we'll be originating both
conforming and nonconforming mortgages, and we'll continue to make the decision as to what goes on our
balance sheet as we have done in the past.
The fact that we'll be originating a lot less will certainly mean that, over time, the MSR and the overall servicing
book will come down very naturally based upon that over a fairly long period of time, but we'll also look for
intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then.
And if those present themselves, we'll certainly be interested in doing that.
And I know Mike will talk a little bit about this, but I think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think
about the size of the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that mortgage
volumes are so low and revenues are so low, the revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the
short term is not meaningful. It's a very small number of people. So that's not all that meaningful in the short term.
The real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business, which as we've tried to make
the point is, it's not just reducing expenses but it's not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments
where we continue to have the servicing. And so, it becomes a positive over time and it's just – but that is not a
short-term benefit for us but certainly a medium to longer-term one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is all you lose initially, Betsy, is the gain on sale on the origination. The servicing
is still here. And that in any given quarter over the last couple years is low tens of millions of dollars, so it's a really
small impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
The servicing cost is low tens of millions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
No. The gain – the only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of the
mortgage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh, the low tens of millions is the gain on sale?

Yeah. I mean...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
No, it's not even close. I mean, the amount that we're originating today relative to the scale we have in the
business, it's immaterial. And even as we've downsized the portfolio on the servicing side, the whole point of – our
servicing portfolio can be substantially, substantially lower and will still have scale to be able to originate the
product and we would say in a more profitable way than we're doing it today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Operator: The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. A question for you. Would the CFPB settlement – there was a comment by the
Head of CFPB about growth initiatives, of slowing your progress. So, Charlie, my question to you is, what are you
planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives? Are you trying to slow anything, any
color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I addressed it in my remarks which is we've been very, very clear. And I think if you look back on every
earnings call, let alone any time I speak publicly, we're very consistent in making sure that everyone understands
both internally and externally that our number one priority is getting that work done. That is how we're running the
company. We have very clear processes internally to make sure that that happens, and we're very confident that's
the case. And the things that we are doing to grow the business, we think, are actually helpful to actually making it
a more controlled place. And we're going to continue to go forward the same way we've been going forward,
being very conscious of making sure things don't get in the way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. A completely different question on, in the past, you've given some color on deposits amongst
different tiers of customers. Any color, any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
It's still very much the same, which is that kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones
who are living more paycheck-to-paycheck and they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that.
But I would say it's the rate of change, it's still the same across most of the affluent spectrum, so the trends are
still very consistent.

Operator: And our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Thank you. Good afternoon. Charlie, [indiscernible] (01:14:10) to flip this question from your answers to the
servicing and the residential mortgage business. Are there any lines of businesses that – I know you can't go out
and make an acquisition, of course – but any lines of business as you're looking to grow and enhance and beef
up maybe through hiring groups of people to do that strategic increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Listen, I think when we look at all of it, I mean, I've said this in the past. When we look at each of these
businesses that we have, and that can be Consumer Bank, it's Consumer Lending, Wealth, Commercial and the
Corporate Investment Bank, with the exception of the Home Lending business. And the rest of the Consumer
Lending businesses that lend, it's all going to be based upon returns and what we're seeing in terms of market
competitiveness, all of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow share. And when we think
about the things that we're doing to invest, we are targeting investment banking ads in both coverage and
products. We're focused in Commercial Banking on the build-out of both the corporate investment offerings for
that customer base. Both the Corporate Investment Bank and the Commercial Bank have opportunities to
continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective, and so we see growth opportunities there.
I've talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more
investment teams as we've reoriented that business. And when we wind up looking in the Consumer Lending
side, you've seen growth in the Credit Card side of the business, which we would expect to continue.
And our Consumer Bank, as we very carefully evolve from fixing the problems that we've had, taking advantage of
the franchise, so when we talk about – and we had this page in the deck, page 19 in the earnings presentation,
we do see multiple places for us to be able to increase the rate of growth by just organically, which sometimes
involves adding people, sometimes it's building technology, sometimes it's just improved execution. And there are
other things like affluence, whatnot, that I haven't mentioned, but there are a bunch and they're pretty broad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets
Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Mike, you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity
write-down in the quarter. Can you share with us how big that was? And then just – I know over the years you
guys have done very well in this area. But – and then second, how big is the portfolio? What's remaining there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. There's about $1 billion write-down, $750 million after non-controlling interest. And so, that's on the first
page of the release if you want to refer back. It was primarily driven by some write-downs in enterprise software
companies. And in particular, it was really one investment that drove most of it. And I would just point out, we had
a – that investment is still a very good investment. The company's a good investment, and we're still holding it
well-above where the invested amount is.
