Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
I will now turn the call over to Vince Delie, Chairman, President, and CEO.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vincent Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer.
FNB's third quarter earnings per share was $0.34, representing an increase of 10% on a linked-quarter basis, and
bringing year-to-date EPS to $0.94. Our performance across our core businesses led to record revenue this
quarter of $321 million, up 18% on an – on a linked-quarter annualized basis with strong underlying momentum
visible on our loan growth, pipeline, fee income, and digital customer engagement.
Let's look at each one of these core building blocks starting with loan growth. Our spot loan growth, excluding the
impact of PPP forgiveness, is 8% annualized linked-quarter, driven by a strong pickup in lending activity in both
the commercial and consumer portfolios. Spot commercial loan growth totaled 7% annualized on a linked-quarter
basis with positive growth in nearly every region across our footprint, notably the Pittsburgh, Cleveland,
Harrisburg, and Raleigh region. Consumer lending grew over 8% annualized linked-quarter, led by increases in
residential mortgages and direct installment home equity loan. As evidenced by the sport loan growth, our teams
had a strong quarter, and overall loan production reached record levels as the economy continues to recover.
We saw a healthy pipeline build and a slight increase in line utilization with the pipeline being up nearly 12% year-
over-year. In prior earnings calls, we indicated our expectation for improvement in loan demand, and that is now
materializing. Commercial had record production in September, and the consumer pipeline jumped 27% year-
over-year. Mortgage activity has slowed more recently because of the decline in refinance activity due to higher
interest rate due to the higher interest rate environment. In addition, revenues have decreased as margins have
normalized. Overall, we are optimistic that our total loan pipeline indicate a path for sustained growth.
As we have continued to execute our strategic plan, noninterest income reached a record $89 million with strong
contributions from capital markets and wealth management, as well as solid SBA revenue. Our emphasis on
diversifying revenue streams has become even more important during a low rate environment. Through our
efforts of enhancing our product suite and expanding our services, our noninterest income now comprises 28% of
our total revenue.
Our Clicks-to-Bricks strategy introduced several years ago was designed to integrate our mobile, online, and in-
branch channels for a seamless and convenient banking experience. Our philosophy of continuing to invest in
technology has resulted in many industry-leading offerings including our e-store, Solutions Center, which features
a retail shopping cart experience, our mobile app, and our website with videos and substantial digital content.
After launching our new website at the beginning of last year, our website engagement has increased 13% year-
to-date compared to the same period in 2020, which included increased usage due to COVID and PPP
originations.
The platform we built with Clicks-to-Bricks has been extremely important, driving the increase in adoption and
usage of digital channels. We continue to make enhancements to provide our customers with the most flexible
banking options as demonstrated by our online application functionality that enables customers to quickly and
easily apply for multiple products, including consumer deposits, credit cards, and home equity and mortgage loan.
In May, we launched our digital applications for mortgages on our e-store. And since then, 61% of all applications
came through our digital channels. And those – and of those applications, approximately 46% were submitted

outside of normal business hours or on the weekend. In addition, over half of our credit card applications were
made digitally in the third quarter. Online applications for small business loans and deposits as well as auto loans
will be available by year-end. And next year, we plan to launch a single, unified application for virtually all FNB
loan-and-deposit products to make the shopping experience for multiple products even easier.
Our new interface will reduce customers' input by eliminating redundant application fields and expand our clients'
capabilities to upload information in a secure portal to expedite approvals. Broader use of e-signature and
automated documentation and disclosures will also be added over time. FNB recently introduced a chatbot which
will apply artificial intelligence and automation to assist our customer service employees in supporting our
customers. The chatbot will identify policies and procedures and provide recommended scripting to address the
top 100 frequently asked questions. We are excited about both the current and upcoming enhancements to our
digital platform, which will continue to drive increased client engagement and client acquisition and improve our
operating efficiency while differentiating FNB in the marketplace.
With that, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss our asset quality position. Gary?

Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Our credit portfolio ended the third quarter very well positioned
following continued positive results across all of our key credit metrics. This solid performance was marked by
further improvement in the level of delinquency and nonperforming loans, reductions in rated credits, and low net
losses for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods. Additionally, improving trends across the broader economy
and government stimulus have further contributed to these favorable results, including deferrals which have
reached an immaterial level of only 0.2% of total loans.
Let's now review some of the highlights for the third quarter. The level of delinquency, excluding PPP balances,
ended September at a very solid 71 basis points, a 9-bp improvement on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting a
notable improvement in nonaccruals within the commercial book. The level of NPLs and OREO improved to end
the quarter at 49 basis points, representing a 9-basis-point reduction from the prior quarter's ex-PPP level. The
reduction in NPLs during the quarter totaled $18 million, and when compared to the year-ago period when NPLs
had reached their peak, declined by $68 million, representing a solid 38% year-over-year reduction.
Net charge-offs for the quarter were very low at $1.6 million or 3 basis points annualized, while year-to-date net
charge-offs were solid at 7 basis points on an annualized basis. We recognized a $1.8 million net benefit in the
provision during the quarter following these improvements in our credit quality position. This resulted in a GAAP
reserve position that was down 1 basis point to stand at 1.41%, with the ex-PPP reserve decreasing 6 bps to
stand at 1.45%.
Our NPL coverage position further improved, ending September at a very solid level of 317%, following the noted
reductions in NPLs during the quarter. Our total ending reserve position, inclusive of acquired unamortized
discounts, totaled 1.56%.
In closing, we are very pleased with the position of our portfolio moving into the final quarter of the year and the
continued progress we've made to further reduce nonperforming and rated credit levels. We remain vigilant and
attentive to any emerging risks in both the broader economy and within the markets in which we and our
customers operate.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
With the continued supply chain and labor disruptions, elevated input costs and the evolving nature of the virus,
our approach to managing and growing our loan portfolio in this highly competitive environment remains balanced
and consistent with our time-tested credit principles that have served us well throughout the various economic
cycles.
This foundation of sound and consistent underwriting, timely and comprehensive management of risk and
selectively pursuing opportunities that fit our desired credit profile will support our future growth objectives as we
move ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Today, I will discuss our financial results for the third quarter and provide guidance for the fourth
quarter. Overall, this was a strong quarter and we were very pleased with the result.
Our continued strategic focus on diversified fee income contribution drove noninterest income to a record $88.9
million, up $9.1 million or 11% linked-quarter, leading to record pre-provision net revenue of $138 million on an
operating basis and a return on tangible common equity reaching nearly 17%. Our tangible book value per share
reached $8.42, an increase of $0.22 or 2.6% on a linked-quarter basis.
Let's walk through the financials in greater detail, starting with the highlights on slide 4. Third quarter EPS
increased to $0.34, up $0.03 over the prior quarter and $0.09 from the year-ago quarter. On a linked-quarter
basis, total revenue reached a record $321 million, an increase of $13.6 million or 4.4%, and drove net income
available to common stockholders to a record $109.5 million, an increase of $10 million or 10.2%.
But excluding PPP, which is more reflective of the underlying loan growth, period-end total loans increased $463
million or 7.8% annualized on a linked-quarter basis, with commercial loans and leases increasing $289 million or
7.4% annualized and consumer loans increasing $173 million or 8.5% annualized, building on the strong growth
generated in the second quarter of this year. As Vince said, this loan growth was across the footprint, with
production levels 17% higher than last quarter and 45% higher than third quarter of 2020.
Let's continue with the balance sheet on slide 7. Reported average loans and leases totaled $24.7 billion, with
average commercial loans and leases decreasing $942 million, which was entirely due to lower average PPP
balances as we saw an acceleration of forgiveness and ended the quarter at $694 million.
On the deposits side, average deposits totaled $30.8 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion or 1.1% primarily in
noninterest-bearing deposit accounts. We continue to see a shift in customers' preferences for more liquid
account in a low interest rate environment, as well as maintaining larger deposit account balances than before the
pandemic. In addition, we have also seen an acceleration of deposit accounts opened digitally.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income totaled $232.4 million, an increase of $4.5 million or 2% from the prior
quarter. Including the PPP contribution and purchase accounting accretion, net interest income increased $2.8
million or 1.4%, reflecting an increase in average loans, more favorable funding mix and lower deposit costs. We
are expecting a slight tailwind for net interest income, excluding PPP contribution, as a significant portion of our
loan growth occurred near the end of the quarter.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Reported net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.72%, reflecting higher PPP contribution of 23 basis
points and a 5-basis-point benefit from acquired loan discount accretion, which was offset by higher average cash
balances that reduced the net interest margin 26 basis points.
Excess cash balances grew to $3.7 billion at quarter end, a 45% increase from June 30. When excluding these
higher excess cash balances, acquired loan discount accretion and PPP impacts, net interest margin declined 2
basis points.
Now, let's look at noninterest income and expense on slides 9 and 10. Record noninterest income totaled $88.9
million, increasing $9.1 million or 11.4% from the prior quarter with broad contributions from each of our fee-based
businesses. Capital markets income increased $5.5 million, reflecting very strong swap activity with solid
contributions from commercial lending activity, as well as contributions from loan syndications, debt capital
markets and international banking.
Service charges increased $2 million, reflecting seasonally higher customer activity volumes. SBA volumes and
average transaction sizes continued to be strong, with $2 million in premium income included in other noninterest
income. Also included in other noninterest income was a $2.2 million recovery on a previously written-off other
asset.
Reported noninterest expense increased $1.7 million or 0.9% to $184.2 million this quarter. Excluding non-
operating items, noninterest expense increased $3.4 million or 1.9%. On an operating basis, the increase was
driven by salaries and employee benefits, increasing $2.9 million or 2.8% due to production and performance-
related commissions and incentives consistent with record levels of total revenue, which was driven by diversified
strong contributions from our fee-based businesses. Overall, we produced a strong quarter and believe we are
well-positioned for the fourth quarter.
Now, let's turn to fourth quarter guidance on page 12. We expect PPP forgiveness to be $300 million to $500
million. With the PPP loan balances decreasing, we're estimating a range of $10 million to $15 million with the
PPP contribution to net interest income, compared to the third quarter's contribution of $27 million. Excluding PPP
contribution, we expect net interest income to be up low-single digits relative to the third quarter.
Continuing to benefit from our diversified revenue base, we expect noninterest income to be in the high-70s to
$80 million for the fourth quarter. Noninterest expense is expected to be around $180 million on an operating
basis, which is subject to normal production-related incentives and commission as we close out the year. We
expect the effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%.
Lastly, I would like to quickly review our full-year 2021 guide given last quarter. We believe we will meet our loan
growth guidance of mid-single digits. We expect full-year GAAP revenue to be up year-over-year, which will
impact the production-related incentives and commissions bringing compensation-related expenses slightly
higher. Full-year provision is expected to continue its strong performance with incremental provision dependent
on the level of loan growth. Overall, we believe we will finish 2021 with solid earnings.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And this morning's first question comes from Frank
Schiraldi with Piper Sandler.

Hey, Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. I just wondered if you could – Vince, you mentioned the $3.7 billion in excess cash. I'm wondering if you could
talk a little bit about your thoughts on working that down over time. Do you expect most of these deposits to stick
around? What is the expectation for maybe securities builds just trying to accrete this to the bottom line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No. I'd say the deposits definitely have been very sticky, the PPP deposits, and we continue to have a
positive growth every quarter going back to the first quarter of 2020. The goal with the cash level is really – the
primary goal was to deploy it to fund loans as we move forward from here. Those opportunities with the Howard
7

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
merger, once we close that, but probably $0.5 billion of that to work related to their borrowings. So that's an
opportunity there.
And in investment portfolio, we're basically going to reinvest cash flows. We reinvested a little bit more this
quarter. During the quarter, we reinvested $621 million on cash flows of 4.53%. There were some opportunities
there to put some money to work. But reinvestment rates of 1.13% are better than the 15% we're earning on the
cash for sure, but still kind of running lower than the run-off rate of 1.90% in the portfolio.
So we're making the securities portfolio grow up a little bit from here. We might reinvest a little bit related to
Howard securities portfolio that we get between now and actually closing that. But the primary goal will be put it to
fund loans and then using cash for some of the transaction in the first quarter. And in the first quarter, Frank, we
take a full look at our whole balance sheet to see if there's other opportunities maybe to deploy some of that cash
and maybe other borrowings that we have on our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just on Howard, wondered if you can remind us what the timing of the cost saves being extracted,
what sort of accretion we should expect from that in 2022 specifically, and would that include things like you
mentioned the borrowings that you could use the cash for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I guess, the overall accretion, if you go back to what we announced when we did the model, was 4%
overall. That's kind of on a full year fully phased in basis, Frank. And when we give guidance in January, we'll
refresh everything as far as where they come on the balance sheet and all the different drivers for the full year.
But that's really the most current figure we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Just lastly on that, just in terms of the cost saves timing. I know you've talked about it in the past, I just don't
recall when you expect those to be fully phased in by.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Frank, we mentioned in the first full year we expect to get 85% of the cost saves by end of the year, so,
again, a big chunk of that upfront with some of the actions we'll take, and then throughout the year we'll kind of
bring them in. And then, like I said, we'll get to 100% in the second year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Timur, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting on the loan growth this quarter, two consecutive nice quarters for commercial loan growth. I hear
your commentary on seeing utilization rates spike up a little bit, gaining some momentum there. I guess can you
talk through what the utilization rate change was during the quarter? And then as you look at loan growth, kind of
ex the PPP headwind, this new momentum that you're gaining, how sustainable is this into 2022? And maybe can
we get an early look at what your expectation is for 2022 loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
This is Vince Delie. We'll cover the 2022 loan growth when we give guidance for next year. So, I don't think we're
going to dive into that right now. But if you look at the past two quarters, we've had pretty good growth across our
geographies. If you recall and we stated for some time now that our plan was to expand into multiple geographies
where we could create enough scale to compete effectively and drive loan growth with geographic diversity. And I
think that's happening. We're seeing growth coming from various parts of our footprint, which covers the seven
state areas. So, we're seeing some good opportunities in the Carolinas, Charleston is doing very well. We
expanded the Charleston a few years ago and we have a great team there. Raleigh and Charlotte are performing
pretty well. We got a team in Greensboro that continues to perform well over time. And then, our traditional
markets, the mid-Atlantic region with our expansion into Washington D.C. and the Baltimore markets contributing,
Pittsburgh contributing, and know Cleveland is picking up momentum.
So, we feel pretty good about where we sit from a utilization perspective. We've seen a little bit of increased
borrowing on credit facilities that support manufacturing and other areas. I think there's still a lot of cash sitting on
the sidelines. And we're still – many of our clients are still experiencing supply chain disruption, which really
prevents them from building inventory position. And then you have the issues with commodity pricing for certain
borrowers who basically are on the sidelines because of the higher cost of raw materials. They're not stockpiling
raw materials for projects. And it's pretty evident as you read about various aspects of the economy. But that's
purely reflected in line utilization.
And then in terms of growth, the one thing I will say is that the pipelines have been fairly robust. We did close
quite a bit in the last quarter. So, we're rebuilding the pipeline. The pipeline, as I stated in my comments, is up
double-digit year-over-year. So, we're optimistic about that in the commercial space. On the consumer side, we
9


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
have a very strong pipeline and that's up 27% year-over-year. So it appears that consumers have been
borrowing.
Gary, if you could just comment on what we funded in line utilization and what we have in commitments that are
out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Sure, Vince. Thanks. In terms of commercial line utilization, specifically to the quarter, we saw a 1.8%
increase. So it went from 32%, a little over 32% to 34%, so almost 2%. So that was a positive move upward and
touched on some of the things that Vince mentioned in the activity. And that all said, the supply chain issues and
pressures across the economy are real. So, that is holding some of that at bay a bit. But it was good to see that
that increased during the quarter.
The other thing that I did want to mention was as we talk about the solid loan growth that we did experience, we
even saw some significant unfunded closings and future loan growth to come. There were about $0.5 billion of
loans that were closed and remain unfunded during the third quarter. And those fundings are split between C&I as
well as CRE. And that'll fund up over the next 12 months, 18 months, the tail end of our 24 months. But that's a
really nice headwind for us from a loan growth standpoint as we look ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you for the color. Maybe just switching gears and looking at some of the technology initiatives that
are either already implemented or coming online over the course of the remainder of this year and into next year.
Can you just remind us what your strategy is as far as partnering with third parties versus building out some of the
platforms in-house? And as you're starting to go more towards AI-style approach for driving applications, is that
going to be – is part of the underwriting going to be handled by AI as well? And if so, maybe talk through that
process as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Our approach is to control the interface. So, from a proprietary perspective, we're developing the interface
with the client. So our e-store solution center that I mentioned, it was very exciting for us and it opens the door for
us to reach millions of customers across our footprint where we may not have physical locations. And they can
actually go into the website pick a product, put it in a shopping cart, put multiple products in the shopping cart,
and then check out by processing multiple applications. And what we're doing is we're continuing to refine that,
we're continuing to add to that offering. We are working with a variety of technology companies, both large and
small, to partner with, to make that experience better. We are developing a proprietary omni-channel application,
which will permit customers to open multiple products on a single application. And that's scheduled to be
launched mid next year.
I think that as we move forward, we just added a couple of other products, we added loan products, we stood up
the mortgage origination platform. So, we've opened about 65% of our total application in the mortgage business,
for example, digitally, which includes the ability to upload information in the portal and process transactions.
So, that's all going extremely well. And we launched – just recently we launched the ability to do consumer loans.
We're going to stand up small business loans with a portal to upload information to help streamline processing.

So, all of that is being built out on the frontend. We're partnering with various entities, large and small, Pfizer, in
some respects and then smaller fintech companies to help deliver the products, but they're being delivered within
our framework.
So, our strategy is to create the interface, control the interface, build out the digital bank, make it as easy as
possible to use, and keep refining it and changing it. And I think it's been extraordinarily well-received by our
customers. We've received a national award for the e-store from BCX, which is pretty prominent award in the
mobile space. And when we incorporate that e-store into our mobile application, which is coming out in
November, that will open the channel up to even more users.
So web traffic is up considerably. I mean, if you look at what we've done, I mean, we've actually been able to
increase usage with our mobile app on a year-over-year basis, really, looking at the first quarter of 2020 versus
the first quarter of 2021 because that takes the pandemic into account, right? So, basically, we're up 40% in
mobile banking usage, we're up 25% in web traffic, we're up 29% in online banking usage, 62% in Zelle person to
person usage.
Our website also has the ability to schedule appointments through that shopping experience with various bankers
or professionals within our company. We're averaging about 800 appointments per month. So it's been sustained.
It's peaked at 2,700 during the pandemic, and then has come down as people have greater access to the
branches, but it's still been fairly robust. And we're averaging about 2,000 deposit applications per month through
that site. So I think, of all the things we talk about here, that's the most exciting part of what we're doing.
And then on the AI side, we're using analytics for a whole bunch of reasons. We developed a team. We have both
the capabilities, self-developed, to process large quantities of data. So we have the people and we have the
infrastructure and data management and a centralized hub to take information from disparate applications and
process it fairly quickly. Millions and millions and millions of bits of information can be processed on our systems
by our people.
And then we have the data analytics team who works with marketing. They work with credit. They work with
finance to utilize artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and to really understand product usage and position
products for sale within that e-store and within the company.
So all of that's going on. We're also using it. Another example would be the chatbot that we developed. And I think
that our people are pretty much plugging in to the technology that we've built out and thinking of ways to use it to
drive efficiency and revenue growth. So very exciting stuff, and I'll stop there. I'm sorry I went on pretty long, but...

Hey, Mike.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I just have a couple follow-ups. I wanted to stick on the technology side for a second there. I was curious if you
guys have taken a look or have anything incremental you could share about kind of how the unit economics of
growing customers is changing as you do more digitally versus kind of the branches historically. And maybe kind
of weave that answer. On the cost side, I know you guys aren't talking guidance next year yet, but the efficiency
ratio has been fairly flat and you guys have managed to grow revenues a bit more than expenses. I mean is that a
dynamic that you think some of these investments can expand moving forward, or do you really need rates at this
point to kind of drive that efficiency ratio down further?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. I think that those investments in technology will help us do two things as we move forward. It'll help us
generate revenue more efficiently because we don't have the legacy infrastructure that we had with a huge
branch system. For example, we've cut over 100 branches since I've been here and have still experienced
growth. In some markets, we've closed branches. And because of our digital offering, we've actually grown
deposits and loans.
So that, to me, a clear indication that our cost to originate is much lower than it has been historically moving
forward. And then the growth that we've seen, both from a depository and loan perspective, is really aided by
those investments in technology. And it's only going to get better as we become better. As we refine that delivery
channel and improve it, it'll become easier for consumers to engage us and get the products and services that
they want in a very convenient way.
And marrying that with the branch people with our Clicks-to-Bricks strategy is to integrate the branches into that e-
delivery channel so that we have kind of concierge out there that know where people are shopping or what they're
looking at online, and then they're able to help facilitate sales within the branches.
So I think it's all finally starting to come together. We've spent two strategic planning cycles investing in these
areas. A lot of that investment is behind us. I mean, obviously, there's more to come, but a lot of the heavy lifting
is behind us and it's embedded in our run rate. We've said that all along. We've not shied away from focusing on
that because I truly believe that's the future of the industry, and we need to be prepared to compete in that space
effectively. And I think we've done a great job. Our people have done a phenomenal job of keeping us in the
game.

Plus, I would just add an efficiency opportunity to drive all the businesses through that channel. We've invested a
lot, like Vince said, getting each business – trust, insurance, wealth business – all through that channel, brings in
more revenue, more opportunity for customers, helps to drive costs down and efficiency ratio. So that's another
element of it, too.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful. Thank you. And then on the noninterest income side, I know you guys provided the guide for the fourth
quarter. I want to talk about two line items specifically, though. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little
bit more color around the service charge line which saw a really nice rebound. Is there anything more to that than
just kind of a rebound of economic activity, I guess, number one?
And number two, on the capital markets side, anything new from a product or sales process going on within that?
Or should we expect that line – I mean, maybe not $12.5 million, but to be fairly robust if your commercial growth
continues to be positive moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, there's two things there. When you look at fees related to depository transaction, we're really growing
treasury management fee income. We've picked up – because of the investments we've made and the new client
acquisition strategy, we're gaining momentum in the fee space for providing treasury management services to
commercial clients. So a good bit of that growth is attributable to that area.
And then on the flip side, on capital markets, when you look at what we've done from a capital markets
perspective, we continue to build out our capabilities. We have a very good team that focuses on syndicating both
C&I and CRE loans, so we get paid to syndicate. We have a debt capital markets group that's taken off. And
we've done a number of transactions where we're able to participate in bond economics because of our debt
capital markets capability that we just completed and built out. We're focusing on municipal finance. We've
received the approvals that we need to move forward with generating fee income in public finance. We have a
fairly robust government lending program, so that goes hand in hand. So, our participation in bond economics
within the public finance space will be important moving forward.
And obviously, the derivatives areas, the core – pretty important core piece of what we offer, and we've continued
to add good people across our footprint to help us participate in that activity as well. So, capital markets is really a
combination of all of that, and then I can't – I have to mention our FX capabilities. We're able to compete very
effectively against some of the largest players in the country and have one business in the upper middle market in
large corporate space because of our capabilities in FX. That was another area which we consider part of capital
markets because they do hedging and spot transactions for customers. So, all of that together provides us with a
good, strong, diverse source of revenue streams within that capital markets business.

Hey, good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Hi, Russell.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I'll just circle back to the loan growth conversation for a second, and appreciate the mid-single digit reiteration. It
assumes about a like amount for the fourth quarter to get there, and then Gary's reminder about consistent
underwriting throughout cycles. But the strong growth of the past couple quarters, that high-single-digit annualized
number, the growth of your markets you've moved into over the past few years with LPOs and M&A, I mean, is
there any reason, just bigger picture going forward, we shouldn't begin to think about FNB as a mid- to high-
single-digit grower rather than mid-single digit? And what would keep you from feeling more comfortable towards
the higher end of that type of range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, historically, we have been a high-single-digit performer. For a long period of time, prior to the pandemic, if
you looked at the average growth rate for the company, we were double digits, including M&A, over a sustained
period of time; and high-single-digit organic loan growth. We stripped out the M&A contribution and looked at it on
an organic basis. We used to report that out to the Street. So, as we move through this cycle, the disruption that
we've experienced, which was fairly substantial given the pandemic, I think we're going to return to those levels,
and it's certainly doable given the investments we've made in our platform. If you really look at how we're
structured for a $40 billion bank to have the opportunity to compete in 10 fairly large markets, right, where we
have a substantial share in those, we consider them midsize cities in the Southeast, in the mid-Atlantic, and the
Northeast. We have the potential to do that, and we're able to do that and still maintain our credit underwriting
standards. I mean, we could grow even faster if we didn't have a great deal of discipline.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Thanks, Vince. I mean, we're seeing continued opportunities at a very good pace. The diversification of the
markets we think is absolutely critical. And, Russell, to your question, the impact of COVID has us from a
guidance standpoint in that mid-single range. As you can see from the last couple of quarters, growth has been
strong in that 8-plus-percent range. So, that's kind of where we'd like to be. That's where we expect to be, and I
think you'll see that as we move forward and put some of these issues behind us. That all said, there are supply
chain issues that are real. Everyone knows that; inflationary pressures, labor issues, and availability as well as
cost. So, there's a lot of headwinds in the economy that need to continue to be worked through. But we're very
confident in our ability to grow the loan book, and we feel good about what we've been able to produce the last
couple quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Thank you, guys. Understood, on the growth trajectory. And then just one kind of tangential follow-up. So,
the recent M&A announcement, prior to that, you've been pretty successful with the LPO strategy. As you think
about the model going forward, how do you balance or how do you want to balance LPO versus M&A, and any
particular market that you want to move into or scale up in and what's the best way to go about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Our focus, as I've said, historically – sometimes what I say is taken out of context, but I'll try to be really
clear. We're really focused on organic growth, on making sure the company is positioned to grow, to provide
benefits to the shareholders. So, when an M&A opportunity comes up like Howard, sure, we're going to look at it.
We're going to measure it against other opportunities to invest capital. And if we think it makes strategic sense for
us to pursue that type of an opportunity, we'll do it in the most shareholder-friendly way we can. So, returns on
capital are important to us. We've historically – we've said that repeatedly. We don't have tons of excess capital.
Our strategy has been to grow tangible book value per share and maintain high returns on tangible common
equity. So, we continue to focus on that. And I think the digital strategy and our investments in the digital platform
really gives us a considerable amount of upside as an organization. If we were a technology company without any
revenue, people would be valuating us extraordinarily high based upon the potential alone.
So I look at that and say how do we deploy capital? We're going to be very cautious about what we do. If M&A
comes about, it would have to be something on the smaller end that fits into our footprint, that helps us gain
efficiency or pick up clients so we can use our investments and technology to drive revenue within that customer
base. And that's the focus of the company.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Curious – most of my questions have been asked and answered. But, Vince,
maybe as you look across the various geographies and markets, are you seeing any difference in term –
differential in terms of loan pricing or opportunities that stand out more than others? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's extraordinarily competitive across the board. I know everybody who said that. And I tell my people, I've heard
that my whole career. So, please don't tell me that. You just have to win, right? So, you have to deliver the best
products at the right time, structure the deal appropriately so we're all secure, and the borrower gets what they
need, and accommodate them. So, it's an extraordinarily competitive environment. I think there's spots where the
pricing is a little better, but it's not materially different. And if you look at Cleveland, for example, which everybody
says is a lower-growth market, theoretically, should have less competition. It's loaded with huge competitors: US
Bank, Chase, Huntington KeyBank, PNC. So, that market is as competitive as Charlotte which is loaded with
large competitors. So, we have to execute better. We have to stay focused on customers. This is still a people
business, so we have to make sure that our brand is aware. People are aware of our brand in the marketplace,
and they basically have the right people in those markets to drive growth.
If you look at our strategy from a visibility perspective, we went in, negotiated opportunities to name buildings in
Greensboro, Raleigh, Charlotte. We have a 30-story office building with our name in it. And Charlotte is a very
cost-effective way for us to promote our brand because we consolidated into that building and moved multiple
locations into one building and actually the occupancy expenses are push, right, or maybe even slightly better.
We did that in a number of markets because we bought smaller banks and then merged them together. We
bought big bank that hasn't emerged all the operations. So, we elevated our profile in all of these cities, and we
built out on a de-novo basis a very good – we've optimized the delivery channel from a retail and commercial
banking perspective in those markets, so long runway. And I think that we're very well positioned. So I – hopefully
I answered your question.

Good morning. This is Samuel Varga on for Brody Preston.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey there. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
My first question. Hey. How are you? My first question is around some of the FHLB borrowings, which you
currently hold on the balance sheet. I understand that you're planning on using some of the liquidity to pay down
borrowings on the Howard side, but I wanted to ask, according to the last few days, about $1.1 billion that was
swapped, and it was supposed to mature this year. And so, I just wanted to ask a little bit about what the repricing
dynamic is around the new borrowing replacing the old ones?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I can tell you the Home Loan borrowings, we have $300 million more to mature in the next four months.
There's $200 million in November. That's 30 basis points. And then another $100 million. Then in January,
February at 1.54% million. So once those two mature, we'll have $930 million left at 2.23%. And then that piece
there we'll evaluate as part of the kind of first quarter, the merger, and really look at our whole balance sheet. So,
that's what will be left after that $300 million matures in next four months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. And then moving over to the fee income – and thank you for the color you provided on –
just on the different moving pieces there. So, I wanted to ask for just a little bit of clarification here. The elevated
swap fee income, is that kind of a reset to a higher run rate, or is there – is that more of a onetime in nature for
this quarter, and it's going to step back down? And if so, is there any corresponding offset on the expense side for
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say if you look – I mean it's definitely a record quarter for us. If you look over the last seven quarters,
we've had three quarters, and we've had a north of $10 million and another quarter that had a $12 million handle
to it. So, I mean it's a little lumpy because of the capital markets or derivatives side of that business. But I think
that, to Vince's point, with all the businesses we've invested in, international syndication and then the new debt
capital markets capabilities we have, which has already added $0.5 million so far year-to-date in its first year of
existence, I think that will supplement it as we go forward. But it'll be lumpy. I mean, our guidance for the fourth
quarter doesn't have $12.5 million in it, but it still has a pretty strong number baked into that forecast, north of
where we were running in in the second quarter.

Brian Martin Q

Hey. Just a couple quick things for me. Just back to the PPP for just a minute. It seems like most of that gets
resolved in the first half of next year. I mean you gave some guidance in fourth quarter that gets – if you got $20
million left, that gets a good chunk of it. So maybe first quarter, we're kind of through PPP. Is that fair how to think
about that?

Okay. Got you. Okay. All right. And then just how about – Vince, maybe just on the core margin, can you just talk
about kind of the puts and takes the next couple quarters here, I guess. It sounds like you mentioned a little bit of
a tailwind maybe with the loan growth, but just kind of the puts and takes here in the near term on the core
margin, kind of excess PPP, the liquidity and the accretion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Vincent J. Calabrese A

...excess cash on the balance sheet and everything. But if you look at the dollars, right, just I'll make a few
comments here. So net interest income for the quarter went up $4.5 million. $1.5 million of that was related to
PPP and the purchase accounting was down about $0.5 million. PPP was up $2 million.

F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
So you had $2 million, $1.5 million to $3 million that was related to just kind of core loan growth. The solid spot
loan growth that we talked about in the second quarter, and third quarter obviously contributes to that. We've
continued to bring down the cost of interest-bearing deposits. We brought that down another 3 basis points during
the quarter.
So the average for the quarter was 21 basis points. And our spot, as we sit here today, is 18 basis points. So
there's already kind of another 3 basis points of benefit in the interest-bearing deposit costs. And then the
consumer CDs continue to roll down. They pick up about 2 basis points a month on CDs as they mature.
So if you kind of put all those pieces in there, and then the level of excess cash obviously is significant from a
margin perspective, right? As we could see on that slide that we've reduced the margin by 26 basis points for the
quarter. So, I mean, as we start to deploy that, that affects the percentage for sure and it also obviously affects
the dollars and net interest income. So we've earned basis points on that.
So every dollar that we put to work for loans obviously is additive to the net interest income. So kind of that all
being said, it's what's baked into our – excluding PPP contribution kind of being up low-single digits in the fourth
quarter versus the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just maybe I just misunderstood what you guys said, or I didn't quite
kind of get it on the loan growth side, but I get the year-over-year pipelines are up. It sounded like given the
strength this quarter and the rebuilding that you're kind of going at right now that the – is the – are the loan
pipelines lower today than they were at the start of last quarter or a similar type of level? Just linked-quarter, how
did the pipelines change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

It varies. It varies. The consumer pipeline is stronger, so it's up, as I said, 27%. It was up substantially. The
commercial pipeline, it's up year-over-year on a linked-quarter basis. It will be down because we had a huge
production.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It was absolutely huge. And as Gary indicated, there's a $0.5 billion in unfunded commitments that we'll fund up
over time within that big production period that we have. So that's how I would look at it. Commercial rebuild,
consumer very strong. And as we move into the last quarter, hopefully, they balance each other out and we're
able to capitalize on some of the larger opportunities we have in the commercial pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Plus, you have the tailwind of the unfunded loans that we'll start to fund up. So that also benefits the loan growth.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And that will carry over into next year as well. So that's not just one quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Okay. Perfect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Yeah. I mean just on the – maybe one for Gary. Just on the classified, I think you said the rated credits
were down, Gary. Just can you comment on just what happened with – classifieds are criticized in the quarter.
And then maybe just talk about how we should think about the reserve prospectively, given how strong credit
appears to be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Continued positive movement across the criticized categories, Brian. And when you look at this quarter,
similarly strong as compared to the last quarter, about $130 million reduction in Q3; about 60% of that reduction
was classified. So continuing to be able to move classified assets off the books just in the normal course of other
banks refinancing them. So our special assets team is continuing to take advantage of that opportunity with the
underwriting that's being seen out there. So that is a positive move, and we'll continue to take advantage of that.
In terms of your question around the reserve, I mentioned some of the headwinds in the economy before, supply
chain, inflation, labor costs. And those issues, those are real, as I mentioned, subject to the economy staying
strong and moving forward through those issues. I would expect that you'll see continued slight reductions in the
reserve and potentially normalizing as you get into late 2022 and into 2023. So we'll see how the economy holds
out, and we'll continue to manage that as we go forward. Naturally, loan growth comes into play there as well.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, something that we'll continue to monitor on a regular basis and manage accordingly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Perfect. Then maybe just one last one if I can sneak it in. Just on the fee income, I think the service
charges have been a topic in the industry with I guess – I saw the growth this quarter, but just as we think about

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
that line item, it's something that continues to grow at this point, or is it just something where you guys are I guess
looking at what competitors are doing on the service charge line going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, it depends on what category within the service line reporting item. Overdraft's down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would expect it to dip, to trend down. We rolled out a product which just received certification where clients can't
overdraft, and it's our second-best product in terms of sales performance. So, I expect continued pressure to
make changes in that category for the industry, not just for us. So, that's not an area of focus. We're trying to look
for ways to provide we call them high-value fees to our customers and to build the revenue streams within other
categories of the service charge area. So, treasury management, as I mentioned, is one area where we've
consistently grown double digit in that area, but it's been muted by other contributors to that category, and we
expect that to continue to grow. There are a number of other products that will start rolling out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Debit card.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Debit card has done really well. It actually rebounded pretty nicely from the pandemic. So, you're seeing
interchange contribution to that category. We continue to roll out commercial cards and procurement cards for our
clients. That's driving interchange fees within the category. So, like our capital markets strategy, we're looking for
diversification within that area, and that's how we would view it going forward; this modest growth in that category
based upon that – the execution and the diversification strategy.
