Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are Clark Khayat, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Risk Officer, Darrin Benhart, who succeeded
Mark Midkiff at the beginning of this year.
On slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures and certain financial measures, including
non-GAAP measures. These statements cover our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-
and-answer segment of our call.
I am now moving to slide 3. This morning, we reported earnings of $30 million, or $0.03 per share. Our results
included $209 million of after-tax expenses, or $0.22 per share, from three items that Clark will describe in more
detail later. For the year, we reported EPS of $0.88, including $0.27 impact from similar types of expenses. Fourth
quarter closes out a challenging year for the industry and for Key.
While our business fundamentals remained solid throughout the year, we acknowledge that our balance sheet
coming into the year was not well-positioned for the rapid rise in interest rates that transpired. We took a number
of necessary steps as we moved through the year to enhance our balance sheet liquidity and capital position in
preparation for potential changes in capital rules, positioning ourselves to be a simpler, smaller, more profitable
bank. These actions also had some near-term financial impacts.
As a result, we missed our own expectations and yours. However, as we turn the page to 2024, I think it is really
important to step back and recognize that Key accomplished a number of positive things last year. And as a
result, I am confident we have laid the groundwork as we move forward.
First and most importantly, throughout the year, the tremendous work and dedication of our teammates allowed
us to continue to serve and support our clients through turbulent market conditions, particularly in the first half of
the year. I am very thankful and proud of our teammates as they set aside the noise affecting our industry,
stepped up and continued to focus on executing on our strategic priorities and steadfastly serving our clients.
Our focus on relationships continued to guide our balance sheet optimization efforts. In 2023, we reduced loans
by $7 billion as we de-emphasized credit only and other non-relationship business. Despite this meaningful

reduction in lending, we grew the number of relationship clients and households we serve across both our
consumer and commercial businesses and grew deposits by $3 billion.
In consumer, we grew relationship households by 3% with about two-thirds of new relationships coming from
younger demographics. Relationship deposits grew by 1%. Commercial clients grew 4% and commercial
balances grew 5% as a result of our continued focus on primacy. About 96% of our commercial deposits were
from clients that had an operating account with Key as of December.
As a result of our ability to raise relationship deposits while reducing loans, we were able to meaningfully reduce
our reliance on wholesale funding as the year progressed. We also continued to raise significant capital for the
benefit of our clients over $80 billion in 2023, leveraging our unique distribution capabilities. This proven and
mature underwrite-to-distribute model is a key differentiator for us.
On expenses, we made significant headway in simplifying and streamlining our businesses. We exited certain
capital-intensive and non-relationship businesses, such as vendor finance, as we have previously done with
indirect auto. In November, we announced a number of organizational changes, including the reorganization and
consolidation of our commercial banking and payments businesses. We also realigned our real estate capital
business with those of our institutional bank. By aligning product-based teams to the client-facing businesses they
serve, we are reducing overhead and complexity and creating a better client and prospect experience.
Altogether, these actions we took in 2023 impacted 6% of our teammates. Additionally, we continued to
rationalize our non-branch, non-operations center real estate footprint, which has declined by 34% over the past
three years. We do not take these decisions lightly, but the reality is we need to make the difficult decisions today
to earn the right to invest in the opportunities of tomorrow. Last year's actions freed up over $400 million on an
annualized basis that we will redeploy to deliver value for our clients and drive future growth.
More broadly, these actions, combined with our ongoing disciplined expense management, have enabled us to
hold core expenses essentially flat at $4.4 billion annually over the past two years, and that is in spite of
inflationary headwinds facing our industry. On the capital front, our risk-weighted assets decreased by $14 billion
from the beginning of the year, exceeding our full-year optimization goal of $10 billion.
Concurrently, we also increased our Common Equity Tier 1 numerator through net capital generation. As a result,
our CET1 ratio increased by 90 basis points to 10% at year-end, well above our targeted capital range of 9% to
9.5%. Our capital metrics, including AOCI, also improved as lower interest rates and the continued pull to par over
time of the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio drove over $1 billion of improvement in our AOCI over the
past year. Tangible book value and tangible common equity ratios both improved meaningfully.
Overall, our capital position remains strong. We are well-positioned relative to our capital priorities and the
currently proposed future capital requirements. In fact, we think we're advantaged relative to other Category 4
banks, given our underwrite-to-distribute model and the asset and capital light businesses that we have, including
a scaled wealth business with $55 billion of assets under management.
Also, I want to comment on credit quality, which I believe is the most important determinant of return on tangible
common equity and shareholder value over time. Credit quality remains a clear strength of Key. Our credit
measures reflect the de-risking we have done over the past decade and our distinctive underwrite-to-distribute
model.

Net charge-offs were 26 basis points in the fourth quarter and 21 basis points for the full year. Our NPAs, which
we firmly believe have very low loss content, remain well below our historical averages. The quality of our loan
portfolio continues to serve us well. With over half of our C&I loans rated as investment-grade or the equivalent,
our consumer clients have a weighted average FICO score of approximately 768 at origination.
As a reminder, we have limited exposure to leveraged lending, office loans, and other high-risk categories. Two-
thirds of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily, of which approximately 40% is in affordable housing,
which continues to be a significant and unmet need in this country.
As we move to 2024, I want to provide my key takeaways from the guidance that Clark will walk you through in
more detail shortly. First, we have a clearly defined net interest income opportunity moving forward as our short-
term swaps and treasuries reprice, particularly in the second half of the year. Importantly, we believe this can be
achieved across a range of interest rate scenarios as a result of the significant work the team has done over the
past year to improve our balance sheet resiliency. We began to see some of that work pay off this quarter as our
net interest income grew slightly relative to the third quarter. Our momentum makes me confident that we saw our
net interest margin bottom out in the third quarter of 2023.
Secondly, we have leading positions and meaningful growth opportunities across capital markets, payments, and
wealth management. We have consistently invested through the cycle in these differentiated fee businesses
where we have targeted scale. We continue to see good client engagement and our pipelines remain strong. Any
normalization in the capital market represents an upside opportunity for Key, not only for fees, but from the
balance sheet management perspective that I spoke about earlier.
Thirdly, while the macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain, based on our current assumptions, we
anticipate we will generate moderate positive operating leverage for the full year 2024. Finally, we continue to
expect that we will outperform the industry this cycle with respect to credit. Credit quality remains one of our most
significant strengths. Over the next several quarters, we continue to expect to operate below our through-the-
cycle net charge-off range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points.
In summary, we acknowledge 2023 was a challenging year, difficult, but necessary decisions were made and
actions were taken, but at this point, we are nearly finished with that process. Our balance sheet is now
appropriately sized for the environment in which we are operating. We are better positioned for changes in
interest rates up or down. Our demonstrated ability to manage and grow our deposits proves to be a strong
foundation. We are now in a position where we can be more opportunistic as we turn the page to 2024.
Before I turn it over to Clark, I want to take a moment to acknowledge last week, we announced Vern Patterson's
retirement from Key. As Head of IR, Vern has led Key through 112 earnings releases and countless meetings with
investors and other stakeholders. I am so grateful, Vern, to have worked alongside you. I have tremendous
appreciation, Vern, for the great relationships you have throughout our industry and within our company. So,
thank you again, Vern.
At the same time, I am pleased to welcome Brian Mauney as our new Director of Investor Relations. With more
than 25 years of experience in our industry, Brian brings a depth and variety of experience and capabilities to the
role. While he has big shoes to fill, I am very pleased that Brian has joined the team.
With that, I will turn it over to Clark to provide more details on the results for the quarter. Clark?

Clark H. I. Khayat
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Chris. I would echo your comments on Vern and a warm welcome to Brian as well. I am now on slide 5.
For the fourth quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.03 per common share, down $0.26 from the
prior quarter and down $0.35 from last year. Our results this quarter were impacted by three items totaling $0.22
per share. First, $190 million from an FDIC special assessment, second, $67 million from an efficiency-related
expense, and third, $18 million from a pension settlement charge for a total of $275 million pre-tax or $209 million
after-tax. A breakdown of these items can be found in the last page of our slide presentation.
Our fourth quarter results were generally consistent with the guidance we provided last month. As expected, we
saw stability in the net interest income line this quarter, and our net interest margin increased by 6 basis points
relative to the third quarter as we began to see some early benefits from our swap and Treasury portfolios. Fees
declined 5% sequentially on the better end of the range we provided last month. Expense growth was primarily
attributable to the three items I mentioned. Without these items, expenses would have been relatively stable
compared to the third quarter.
Net charge-offs as a percent of loans remain low at 26 basis points, and we added $26 million to our allowance
for credit losses to reflect some modest migration in the portfolio, primarily in real estate and the still-uncertain
macro outlook. Additionally, as Chris highlighted in his remarks, our results reflect our focus on primacy and
building relationships, our improved capital position, and our strong risk discipline.
Turning to slide 6, average loans for the quarter were $114 billion, down 3% from both the year-ago period and
prior quarter. The decline in average loans was primarily driven by a reduction in C&I balances, which were down
4% from the prior quarter. The reduction reflects our planned balance sheet optimization efforts, which prioritize
full relationships and de-emphasize credit-only and non-relationship business.
We reduced risk-weighted assets by $4 billion in the fourth quarter, and as Chris mentioned by approximately $14
billion in 2023. The majority of the decline in risk-weighted assets this quarter was from lower loan balances, with
some reduction in unused commitments also contributing. We would expect modest RWA reductions in the first
half of 2024.
Turning to slide 7, Key's longstanding commitment to primacy continues to deliver a stable, diverse base of core
deposits for funding. Despite a year of market volatility, we grew period-end deposits year-over-year by $3 billion,
and average deposits were relatively stable compared to the year-ago period and prior quarter. On a sequential
basis, commercial deposits grew 4%, which we attribute primarily to seasonal build, and consumer deposits grew
1%.
The increase in commercial and consumer deposits was mostly offset by a $2 billion decline in broker deposits on
average, as we continue to improve the quality of our funding mix by growing core relationship balances and
reducing reliance on wholesale funding and broker deposits.
Since the end of the first quarter, we generated almost $13 billion of liquidity by reducing loans and growing
relationship deposits, and reduced wholesale borrowings by $12 billion. Our total cost of deposits was 206 basis
points in the fourth quarter, and our cumulative deposit beta, which includes all interest-bearing deposits, was
49% since the Fed began raising interest rates, in line with our prior guidance of approaching 50% by year-end
2023.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
The higher rate environment continues to impact our deposit mix, as our non-interest-bearing deposits declined
by 1% sequentially to 22%. Pressure on deposit pricing appears to be abating across the franchise, though we
expect some mix shift to continue as long as rates remain high.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $928 million for the fourth quarter, down 24% from
the year-ago period and up slightly from the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.07% for the fourth
quarter, compared to 2.73% for the same period last year, and 2.01% for the fourth quarter – the prior quarter.
Year-over-year, net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the impact of higher interest rates, as
increased cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings outpaced the benefit from higher earning asset yields.
Additionally, the balance sheet experienced a shift in funding mix from non-interest-bearing deposits to higher-
cost interest-bearing deposits.
Relative to the third quarter, the increase in net interest income and net interest margin were driven by actions
taken to manage Key's interest rate risk, elevated levels of liquidity, and an improved funding mix. The increase
was partly offset by higher interest-bearing deposit costs, which exceeded the benefit from higher-earning asset
yields. While the planned reduction in loan balances adversely impacted net interest income sequentially, it
benefited Key's net interest margin.
Our net interest margin and net interest income continue to reflect the headwind from our short-dated treasuries
and swaps, which together reduced net interest income by $345 million this quarter, or by $1.4 billion for the full
year, and lowered our net interest margin by 77 basis points this quarter.
As previously discussed during our third-quarter earnings call, in October, we terminated $7.5 billion of received
fixed cash flow swaps, which were scheduled to mature throughout 2024. Last quarter, we said that net interest
margin would bottom, and it did. Throughout 2024, we would expect continued benefit from the maturities of our
short-term swaps and treasuries, especially as more mature in the back half of the year.
Moving to slide 9. Non-interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, down $61 million from the
year-ago period, and down $33 million from the third quarter. The decrease in non-interest income from a year
ago reflects a $36 million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees, driven by lower syndication
fees and M&A advisory. Additionally, corporate services income declined $22 million, driven by lower customer
derivatives trading revenue. The decrease in non-interest income from the third quarter reflects a $13 million
decrease in other income, primarily driven by a gain on a loan sale in the prior quarter.
I'm now on slide 10. Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.4 billion, up $216 million from the year-ago
period, and up $262 million from last quarter. As mentioned, fourth quarter results reflect $275 million of impact
from FDIC assessment, efficiency-related expenses, and pension settlement charge. Efficiency-related expenses
included $39 million related to severance and $24 million of corporate real estate rationalization and other
contract termination or renegotiation costs.
Excluding these items, expenses were relatively stable in the quarter and down compared to the year-ago period.
We continue to proactively manage our expense base and simplify and streamline our business so we can
continue to reinvest in all our businesses.
Moving to slide 11, overall credit quality and our related outlook remain solid. For the fourth quarter, net charge-
offs were $76 million or 26 basis points of average loans. This compares to $71 million in the prior quarter.
Criticized outstandings to period-end loans increased 50 basis points this quarter, driven by movements in real

estate, healthcare, and consumer goods. While non-performing loans and criticized loans continue to move up off
their historical lows, we believe Key is well-positioned in terms of potential loss content.
Over half of our NPLs are still current. Our provision for credit losses was $102 million for the fourth quarter,
including $26 million of reserve bill, and our allowance for credit losses to period-end loans increased from 1.54%
to 1.60%.
Turning to slide 12. We significantly increased our capital position throughout 2023. We ended the fourth quarter
with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and up 90 basis points from the
year-ago period. We remain focused on building capital in advance of newly-proposed capital rules while
continuing to support relationship client activity and the return of capital. As such, we expect to stay above our
current targeted range of 9% to 9.5% and do not expect to be buying back our stock in the near-term.
Our AOCI position improved by $1.4 billion this quarter. The right side of this slide shows Key's go-forward
expected reduction in our AOCI mark based on two scenarios. The forward curve is December 31, which
assumes six FOMC rate cuts in 2024 and another scenario where rates remain at their current level. In the
forward curve scenario, the AOCI mark is expected to decline by approximately 24% by the end of 2024 and 34%
by the end of 2025, which would provide approximately $1.8 billion of capital built through that timeframe. In the
flat rate scenario, we still achieve 19% of that benefit between now and year-end 2025. Said differently, we still
accrete $1.6 billion of capital rates remain flat to current levels, driven by maturities, cash flow, and time.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for 2024 relative to 2023. Given uncertainty regarding eventual timing and extent of
Fed interest rate cuts in 2024, our guidance reflects outputs from a few potential scenarios, ranging from the
December 31 forward curve, which assumes six 25-basis point cuts over the course of 2024, starting with an
initial cut in March, to a scenario more closely aligned with the Fed's dot plots, which currently assumes three rate
cuts.
We expect average loans to be down 5% to 7%, mostly reflecting the actions we have already taken over the
course of 2023. In other words, the vast majority of the decline in average loans is a function of our reductions in
2023 and are reflected in our year-end balances. We expect period-end loans at the end of 2024 to be relatively
stable compared to the end of 2023, with some decline in the first half of the year, offset by growth expected in
the second half of 2024.
We expect average deposits to be flat to down 2%. Net interest income is expected to be down 2% to 5%, mostly
reflecting the lower fourth quarter exit rate relative to the first half of 2023. This equates to net interest income in
2024 that is up low single digits relative to our annualized fourth quarter exit rate. I'll provide more color on our net
interest income outlook shortly. We expect non-interest income to be up 5% or better with upside of capital market
activity normalizes and market levels and GDP trends remain constructive.
Non-interest expense should be relatively stable at about $4.4 billion as we realize the benefits from our 2023
efficiency actions. We will continue to tightly manage our cost base, including executing on additional
opportunities to simplify and streamline our organization. At the same time, we will continue to protect and invest
in our franchise, including most importantly, our people. As Chris mentioned, our guidance suggests moderate
positive operating leverage in 2024, driven by meaningful expansion in the second half of the year, outpacing
tough comparisons in the first half.

For the year, we expect credit quality to remain strong and net charge-offs to continue to modestly increase to the
30 basis points to 40 basis point range, still well below our over-the-cycle range of 40 basis points to 60 basis
points. Our guidance for our GAAP tax rate is approximately 20%.
Turning to slide 14, given heightened investor focus on this topic, we wanted to provide a little more granularity
than we have in the past about the pacing of our net interest income opportunity as we move through 2024.
Hopefully by now, you're familiar with our well-defined net interest income tailwind as the impact of our short-term
swaps roll off and treasuries mature, especially in the back half of 2024.
The ultimate opportunity remains largely unchanged at approximately $900 million. As a reminder, the benefit
increases each quarter as more of the swaps roll off and treasuries mature, culminating in the full amount in the
first quarter of 2025. So, this all builds quarter-by-quarter since the initial set of swaps came off the books in the
first quarter of 2023.
As we turn the page on 2023, we are nearing the halfway point of this journey. Since we're now through three full
quarters, we're sharing a three-part view. First, on the left in light gray are the three quarters of benefit we've
already realized. In total for 2023, that was approximately $85 million of additional income. The next four bars
show the progression through 2024. As you see, the value builds from each quarter's tranche and accrues in the
following quarter. Each bar represents the value for the quarter. In other words, in 1Q 2024, we expect to realize
$78 million of additional net interest income versus 1Q 2023 from these positions.
For 2024, we estimate the benefit to be approximately $500 million in total, which is the sum of the four quarterly
bars. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over the benefit received in 2023, which, as
previously mentioned, was approximately $85 million.
The final bar to the far right, which has been the main focus of this discussion over the last year or so, is the first
quarter 2025 number. This shows the benefit currently estimated for the quarter at approximately $220 million
from essentially the entire swap and short-term Treasury portfolios rolling off. Again, this is incremental to 1Q
2023 and represents an annualized value of approximately $900 million.
We believe the reinvestment of these fixed-rate assets and swaps represents an outsized opportunity for Key
relative to our peers, but it's also important to remember that this is just one component that drives our net interest
income outlook.
On slide 15, we provide other key inputs and assumptions driving our NII outlook, deposit betas, balances and
mix, loan growth, as well as seasonal factors. Putting these all together, we expect our first quarter NII to be down
3% to 5% from the fourth quarter. From there, we expect to grow and start to accelerate in the second half of the
year as the pace of swaps and US Treasury maturities pick up meaningfully at nearly $5 billion in aggregate per
quarter.
From the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect our quarterly net interest income to grow
10% plus and exit the year north of $1 billion. We would also expect the net interest margin to improve
meaningfully to the 2.40% to 2.50% range by the end of 2024. This will put us on a strong trajectory as we enter
2025.
With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Clark, a lot of good color on the net interest income with those slides, but can you just go into a
little bit more detail about the moving parts to the net interest income opportunity and maybe some other factors
that impact your outlook? And then, secondly, if you could talk about the quarterly NII progression. You gave us
the first quarter down 3%, but clearly, it's going to be a pretty meaningful impact – uptick in the second half of the
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, thanks, Peter. And I appreciate the question. I know this is a point of interest, so let me provide a little bit of
context for the guide and the trajectory, and hopefully it'll be helpful. I think, first, maybe just start with the puts
and takes, which I think is the nature of your question there, and I'm going to just categorize sort of the big
movers. I think, one, loan balances, which, again, we guided kind of down 5% to 7% for the year. Asset yields, I'm
going to separate those from the swaps and treasuries because I just want to identify those separately. Deposit
balances, deposit pricing and funding costs, and then the swaps and treasury portfolios.
So, if you think about those as kind of five key levers on the guide. If I go full year 2023 to full year 2024, which
we've said down 2% to 5%, the headwinds there are going to be the loan book, so down 5% to 7%, obviously
that's going to impact NII. Deposits flat to down is a little bit of drag. Earning asset yields will drop year-over-year
as rates get cut, and then deposit and funding costs will be up for the year as that fourth quarter kind of
annualized number rolls through.
So those are the headwinds. What we have coming our way is the swaps and the Treasury portfolio as they
mature throughout the year, and then a better funding mix as we move through and become more and more
reliant on deposits as we have this year. So, that sort of dimensionalizes what that year-over-year look shapes out
to be. If you take the fourth quarter of 2023 annualized and you compare that to the full year 2024, we're guiding
up, low-single digits there. The biggest difference being that that funding cost that really is pretty flat from fourth
quarter through 2024, which was not the case if you did the year-over-year comparison, and you still get the
benefits of swaps and Treasuries coming in during the year and a better funding mix.

So, you start to see that down 2% to 5%, flip to up low-single digits. We talked a little bit about the first quarter
being down, but let me just go fourth quarter to fourth quarter. So, I think that exit piece is important. You're going
to have deposits down a bit and earning asset yields down a bit going from fourth quarter of 2023 to fourth quarter
of 2024, but you get a nice pickup in the quarterly swap and Treasury portfolio.
Our overall funding costs should be down in that quarter as rates have been cut throughout the year. And then
again, you still have some benefits of funding mix and all that together, we think, is 10%-plus quarter-to-quarter
NII growth. So, we think that's a nice pickup kind of end of year-to-end of year. And then, as you roll into 2025,
you have that last $5 billion tranche of treasuries and swaps maturing in the fourth quarter that accrues to the first
quarter of 2025. So, we start to hit the ground running really nicely with a very steep trajectory as we enter 2025.
So, I'll stop there. That was a lot of stuff, but just trying to give you the components that are moving around.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, our guide of 2% to 5% kind of incorporates a couple of different views, kind of the range being the
current forward down six with the first cut in March, incorporating the lesser cuts on the three Fed dot plots. I think
our general view is more aligned to four cuts with the first one middle of the year, but we're trying to provide
guidance that I think incorporates all that. And as you know when those cuts occur and the magnitude of that will
– will roll through to how we manage our deposit pricing, obviously.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Thanks for all the moving pieces – hey. Thanks for all the moving pieces in the NII color. I guess, Clark, you've
discussed the 3% sort of normalized margin. I know we get sort of one – one final uplift between fourth quarter of
next year and first part of 2025, so the – I think the way you've guided to fourth quarter of next year gets you a lot
of the way there, but, certainly still some room left over. Is the 3% normalized margin kind of still where – what –
where you're bogeying and what has to happen to get us to do that sort of range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So, if you just go back, and we've talked a little bit about this, and it's overly simplistic to be
clear, but if we took second, third, fourth quarter of 2023 and put the impact of swaps and treasuries back in the
margin, we'd be $281 million to $284 million in those quarters, which we think is pretty reflective of what we've got
right now, and that's with this sort of oddly long-standing downward sloping yield curve.
So, I think that range as we get into 2025 feels like achievable and I think getting to that longer term 3% probably
needs us to have a more traditional upward sloping yield curve just, that tends to accrue a little bit to all of our
benefit on NIM. But I do think that $280-plus million is pretty reflective of the underlying core ability of the
business as it stands today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Perfect, thank you. And then either Clark or Chris, just, the fee guidance feels like you're approaching with an
abundance of conservatism regarding the capital markets outlook. Just curious, if you could maybe put a finer
point on what sort of recovery you are presuming? What kind of upward leverage there might be if things do
normalize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Scott, happy to address that. So, if you take what we just reported of a $136 million specifically on the line
you asked about investment banking and debt placement fees, that would annualize at about $544 million.
Conversely, if you took sort of the business and removed 2021 and said that's an outlier, that traditional run rate is
at least kind of $650 million. So, I think we – I think we have been conservative and that's why when we gave
guidance, we've said non-interest income up 5-plus percent, and then we put the qualifier upside if capital market
– capital markets activity normalizes. We don't see it really normalizing until the back half of the year.
However, it's an interesting phenomenon. When the 10-year went above 5% and then came back down, as you
can imagine, people started to transact. And so, we're seeing the beginning of it now. But yes, it's a conservative
number. The other thing that's in that fee number is you saw that we had a step-down with respect to our
derivatives and hedging income. A lot of that is tied to the balance sheet. And as we go through 2024 and we get
back to growing the balance sheet after going through our exercise on RWAs, you'll see that come back as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for that. And then finally, Vern, best wishes. Thank you so much for
everything.

Good morning, John.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
First, congratulations, Vern. Best of luck. You're a legend. And, Brian, welcome. Looking forward to working with
you again. Question on the – a little bit more on the NII dynamics. I wanted to get your thoughts on if we do see
the cuts materialize as you had baked in your expectations, what type of deposit beta you expect is achievable on
the initial cuts, and how would you think about accumulative on the way down, and what is factored into your net
interest income outlook in terms of that beta? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, John, so I'll just – I'll start with that, and then I'm going to flip it over to Clark. A couple of things to keep in
mind. We have a big commercial franchise, and so 40% of our deposits, $145 billion, are commercial, and of
those, about two-third are either indexed or index-like. Now, on the other side of the equation, we've been pretty
conservative in assuming that as the first cuts, particularly if they aren't steep cuts, that we'll continue to get drift
up on the consumer side. Also, we've also forecasted just a bit of continued transition from interest-bearing to
non-interest-bearing, but we think we've sort of bottomed out there. Clark, what would you add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, so – so maybe broadly, John, on the NII guide, we would expect some drift up, particularly in the first
quarter on deposit pricing, just as rates stay high. As Chris said, when the cuts come, I think a good way to think
about that commercial book, because we've talked about the index nature of it, as Chris just referenced, is sort of
kind of an almost automatic mid-teens beta on a cut because of that, how that index pulls through. So, the
question really is going to be what happens to the consumer book and how quickly can we move that?
I think a 25-basis point cut with a kind of long waiting period, does it provide a lot of opportunity to reduce if we
start to see bigger cuts or cuts sooner or more rapid cuts that allows us to deploy those price reductions into the
book? So right now, as I said, we're really looking at kind of our view is more like the four cuts starting in the
middle of the year. We think we'll probably have some stabilization, maybe a little – a bit of consumer drift through
that time period and then we'll start to proactively move rates down. But given the timeframe in 2024, hard to say
exactly what the beta will be on the way down for the year, but it's really going to pick up in 2025.

We'll see some benefit in 2024, but on the consumer book, it's just going to lag a little bit. And that – and candidly
that's just going to be as much a competitive – a function of competitive environment as anything else. But we are
taking some actions in the consumer book today to prepare for cuts. We're not cutting rates, but, preparing our
franchise to be ready for that. And, I think we'll be very proactive when that opportunity shows up.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay, thanks for that. And then separately on the credit front, can you give us a little bit more color on the
25% increase in non-performers in the quarter and maybe a little more color on the criticized asset increase? And
I know your commercial real estate NPL ratio now is 6.9%. What was that last quarter? Was that the biggest
increase in the non-performers? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, I'll come back to you on the increase from third quarter. I don't have that right in front of me. But on your
other points, the NPA uptick, really, is a small list of identified credits. Most of which we feel very good about the
loss content. So, it is a pickup in the ratio, but we don't think that's a loss driver.
On criticized, look, that is a function of continued higher rates putting some stress on what I'd call kind of the first
order rating variable around debt service coverage. So, that does drive rating migration in our book. That rating
migration does pull through to criticize and classified. But when you get underneath that metric and you look at
things like client's willingness to build the interest reserve and the value of the collateral given we tend to
underwrite at 60% or lower CLTVs out of the gate, we just don't see a lot of lost content there.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to extend my best to Vern as well. And, I just wanted to say we really appreciate all
your help over the years. So, a big thank you. And then on my question, I think you said you still expect some
modest RWA reduction in the first half of 2024. Is that all coming from the loan book?
And, as we think about the long end of the curve, staying here or even moving lower, you should have a lot more
clarity on accreting that AOCI back over time. So, what would you need to start leaning into loan growth a little or
deploying capital elsewhere?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, we're about where we need to be in terms of going through our whole portfolio. As we went through and
we're looking and focused on RWAs really was sort of in three buckets, and we actually went account-by-account.
And I've often said that on a risk-adjusted basis, standalone credit, properly graded, can't return its cost of capital.
And, so we were extremely prescriptive across the entire firm of going through that.
On top of that, we exited some businesses like vendor finance, that, by the way, is a credit-only business. And
then on top of that, there were certain areas where we were conservative in terms of our capital treatment, where
we could actually reduce RWAs without, in fact, having any impact on NII. That process is really over. When I say
the process is over, we will continue, obviously, to look through our portfolio. But in terms of really seeing the
step-down in RWAs, as you saw last year, $14 billion, that's behind us.
And so, as we look forward, Clark talked about sort of the lag from the starting point on loan growth. But as you
know, we have the ability to generate loan growth here at Key. We've got a long history of that. We'll be back kind
of focused on serving our clients. Now, having said that, I personally have a view, everyone has sort of coalesced
around the soft landing. I think inflation is still pretty sticky. I think there is a bunch of drivers out there. We're
managing the business for a short recession in 2024, and obviously, that goes into our thinking, because if you
think about working capital in the context of a shrinking economy, that shrinks some loan demand.
The other thing that we have to grow through, and this is by design, is we're going to have $3 billion of runoff in
our consumer business. I hope that helps kind of on the puts and takes. When there is business to be done from
a loan perspective, I am confident that we can get it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
The only other thing I'd add, Manan, is just – just to reground everybody in the average-to-average move. So,
$118 billion of average in 2023, ending point $112.6 billion. So, most of that decline in loans happened last year,
we're pulling that through. There may be a little bit more, as we said, in the first quarter, maybe into the second
quarter, as some of that non-relationship business continues to move out, but we'll see the build-back through the
course of the year, and expect the ending of 2024 to be relatively stable with where we exit 2023. So, we'll see a
rebound. And to Chris's point, if there is less softness in the economy and more opportunity, then we'll lean into
that opportunity.

That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, as we look out into 2025, there is a lot of puts and takes here on
the NII side, but what's the most optimal rate environment for Key? Is it, six rate cuts and then an upward sloping
yield curve? Is that the most optimal environment? Or, would you rather see a higher short end rate and a flatter
yield curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
I think, look, I think an upward sloping yield curve benefits the business broadly. I am not as concerned at the
moment about four cuts or six cuts. As we move through the year, while we're liability-sensitive today, as we
move through the year and, swaps and treasury portfolios burn off, we're going to slightly become more asset-
sensitive naturally. So, we really want to be neutral and able to operate in any of those environments, but if I had
my choice broadly, I think an upward sloping yield curve is always a valuable place for us to be in this business.

Operator: And our next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. So, I apologize, one more question on net interest income. I think the stock is a little bit soft
today because, consensus was expecting, quarterly positive progression on the net interest margin given the
fixed rate opportunity. And I am just wondering, in context of the modest RWA reductions, Clark, that you're –
you're forecasting or you're telling us it's happening for the first half of the year, how much of that is impacting the
NII trajectory? And are those RWAs being reduced through credit link notes that could impact the net interest
income?
And then as a follow-up to that, as we think past, the first half of the year, do you feel like we've moved – going
back to what Chris has said, the process is over, is that a cleaner way to think about where your balance sheet is
or has to be relative to where you think the capital could be in the second half of the year? In other words, there
won't be any more wholesale actions that can impact this NII and NIM trajectory?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, thank you, Erika, good – good question as always. So, the decline in the first half, again, is the
continuation of some actions we took to manage RWAs last year. So again, relationship, non-relationship and
credit-only – clients coming down, we do – we don't have anything factored in at the moment around RWA
management related to credit link notes. As you and I have talked about before, we're doing our homework to
understand those opportunities, but it's not part of the guidance at the moment. Really, it would be that loan
reduction and that will put a little bit of pressure on first quarter as will the fact that rates remain high in the first
quarter under almost any cutting scenario and we'll have a little bit of beta drift.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
So, that's really the first quarter pressure, but I think your point about kind of a clean balance sheet entering the
second half is the right one and I think, again, we're suggesting kind of a tepid recession kind of mid-to-late year if
that doesn't come through and we see a more constructive economic environment. I think there is some
opportunity to grow loans, but I do think as we progress through the year, you'll see NIM expand, you'll see NII
grow nicely, and you'll see the balance sheet, I think, on the right trajectory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is a bit of a two-parter as I am trying to squeeze it in. Clark, I think when I first met
you, I was very impressed by how – you – you were so good at understanding where your funding needs and
funding sources. So, my question for you is, are these two-thirds of your commercial deposits in commercial, are
they truly indexed on the way down, right? There's a – a few regional banks have warned us that they're indexed
on the way up and perhaps more negotiated on the way down. And I guess the other question is that, is it
possible to break down on slide 14 on your maturity schedule, what would the Treasury's component be and the
swap component, only because, obviously, there is a lot of debate on whether or not the cuts in the curve will
happen, which clearly impacts, some of the math behind the swaps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yes. So, the second one, Erika, is easy. We've – I think we've provided that breakout before. We'll – we'll deliver
it, that's – that's not a problem at all. On the first, I think, look, it's a fair point because not all of those commercial
deposits are contractually indexed. So, I think that's the right question. There is always a little bit of, it's easy to
negotiate with a client when you're giving them rate and it's a little bit harder when you're taking it away. But I
would say our view is, well, it may not perfectly pull through. We have spent a lot of time with these clients, we've
been in front of them probably more than we would care to admit over the last year, but in a way that I think we
have a good understanding of how those dynamics would work and we expect that the components of what we
think are indexed will come through.
And just as a reminder, the – when we say indexed, it's not all 100% indexed. So, there is a range of that, so
bringing a client down who is indexed kind of 50% doesn't feel as challenging to negotiate than somebody who is
coming down at 100% [ph] client (00:52:32). And so the book – the book is pretty broadly distributed across, 20%
to 100%, and, we're going to actively engage those clients to make sure we can manage the book appropriately.

Chris, one of the interesting developments over the last 12 to maybe 36 months has been the increased
competition from the private credit lenders into the commercial space. Can you share with us – obviously, you
guys are strong big regional lender in the C&I space. What are you guys seeing from competition from those non-
depository lenders? And the second, if any of them are your customers, how do you balance their needs with – at
the same time competing against them for lending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. It's a great question and it's developing quickly. So, principally, they are customers of ours and let me
explain what I mean by that. As you all know, we distribute 80% of the capital we raise. So, we are distributing all
the time a lot of paper to these private debt funds and it's an important part of our underwrite-to-distribute model.
As we've said many times that for banks, a standalone, properly-graded credit can't return its cost of capital. That
is not the situation for the private debt funds. They have the benefit of leverage-on-leverage.
We have to be a relationship bank, we have to – we have to be able to provide all of the payments capabilities, all
of the capital markets capabilities, and that's actually an opportunity for us because I think what you'll see is as

these private debt funds continue to grow, they'll need to partner with banks and they'll want to partner with banks
that have sophisticated capabilities around things like payments and capital markets, but don't necessarily want to
hold, on a risk-adjusted basis, paper that doesn't return – that doesn't hurdle. So, I look at it, frankly, as an
opportunity. For us, I think we're well-positioned for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then coming back to credit, you mentioned, obviously, you have minimal or very low exposure to
office space, which is great in this environment. And then you have the multifamily exposure. But 40%, I think you
said was in low-cost housing. Can you share with us what are you guys seeing in some of the markets where
there's been rapid buildup of not necessarily low-cost housing or subsidized housing, but normal housing in the
multifamily? Are you seeing issues in that subsegment of the multifamily market, or do you not have much
exposure to those markets that are growing rapidly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, we don't have a lot of exposure because you'll remember, Gerard, we exited a lot of these, what we call,
gateway cities probably five years ago based on affordability, based on cap rates. But we do have a fair amount
of insight in that we have this third-party commercial loan servicing business, and we are the named special
servicer on over $200 billion of loans. And in that area, 44% of what's in active special servicing, which is, really,
what didn't workout, is office, but the fastest-growing segment over the last quarter was, in fact, multifamily in
some of these gateway cities.
So, we're not seeing it in our portfolio because it's not an area of focus, but we are picking it up through the
reconnaissance we get through our third-party commercial loan servicing business. Just one little add-on to that
that I think the group might find interesting that I did when I was talking to the leaders there. Actually, what is in
special servicing is down – we had a record year in 2023, as you can imagine. What is in active special servicing
actually ticked down, which I think is just an interesting data point for all of us that kind of follow the market.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, Chris, one of your – one of your competitors' CEO has said scale has never been more important and that
competitor is larger than you are. And so, pulling back the lens, how do you think about scale and how it's
changed over the past year?
And I have two specific questions before you give that broader answer. What percent of the value of commercial
relationship is from the deposits? That's a specific number. And then what percent of the revenues that you get
from your typical commercial relationship is fee-based versus lending-based? Because I think that gets to the
larger value proposition of Key.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
For sure. Well, let me – let me start with the larger question first, and then we'll talk a bit about the mix of spread
income to fee income, which I do think – by the way, let me just start there. I think that's a great barometer. As
you know, throughout Key, we're 40% fee income, which for a Category IV bank is at the high end of the
spectrum.
As we look at businesses like our institutional bank, the split there in some areas is as high as 80% fees, 20%
spread. And it varies depending on the business because some businesses are more capital-intensive than
others. But that is one of the metrics we look at to see what kind of penetration we're getting. As it relates to scale,
and I think it's a really good and important question.
On one hand, there's no question that if you have to carry more capital and capital is more expensive, that would
put more of a premium on scale than before and the same would go for things like cyber. So, on the margin, yes,
scale would be probably more important today than it was 12 months ago. Having said that, I do not think scale is
the answer for a bank like Key. And I say that because when you have competitors that are 20 times as big as
you are, the question really is, what is scale? And as you know, what we've decided to do is focus on targeted
scale to be really, really relevant to the customers that we try to be relevant to.
We're certainly not trying to compete in the same manner that the largest banks. They have a nice business
model, it works for them, but that's not a business model, Mike, that – that we're – that we're executing at all.
Does that answer your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, I mean, I think this kind of goes to the stickiness of corporate deposits and how that's changed over the
past year. And you answered the question of fees. How much of the value of your commercial relationship is
deposit-driven? And you have the cash and treasury management and other services that you provide, corporate

treasurers, is that still sticky? And is that like 20%, 30%, 50% of the value, as some have said? And then just
another follow-up is, what does all your thinking mean about acquisitions, if and when, generalized securities
losses go down for you and the targets? Are you looking to be in that game or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, on the acquisition front, as you know, we've had a lot of success buying niche businesses and successfully
integrating them, which I don't think a lot of large companies, forget about banking, have had a lot of success
doing. We are still, because of our targeted scale focus, we are still interested in doing that. We're always building
these pods of people and actually looking for small organizations.
In terms of looking, Mike, at depositories, that's not something we're spending any time doing. I think when you
look at the landscape, one, I think the – up – with the regulatory slash approval process, I think there's a lot of
questions around that. Obviously, the pull to par, any unrealized losses become realized losses in the event of an
acquisition.
And then secondly, there's just so much uncertainty in the marketplace. I think one would have a lot of questions
about what is actually in the book of the company that you're acquiring. So that's not something I'm spending a lot
of time on. Getting back to your question, there's no question that there's a significant value in the deposits.
And for example, that's one of the reasons we're really focused this year on building out our business banking
business, because that's a business that's very deposit-centric, and as you think about going forward, there's a lot
of value in there. I don't have off the top of my head what percentage is the contribution. I think it's around – we'll
circle back to you. I think it's about 30% of the value is in the payments and deposits, but we will circle back to you
and confirm that.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And I want to start out, Vern, like everybody else said, almost everybody on the call, congratulations. You're really
one of a kind, so we're going to miss you. In terms of my question, so first, I want to go back, Clark, to your
response to Scottie Siefers' earlier question on where NIM could go. You said 2.80% to 3%, like in a more normal
environment, whatever the hell that is, right? We haven't seen that in 20 years. But you guys used to do 3% to
3.20%. Is there something – it's really a two-part question. One, is there something structural, maybe, the way
you're using swaps today that there's a lower ceiling on NIM, like 3% to 3.20% is gone, maybe 3% is like upper
end?
And then secondly, assuming this benefit accrues through 2024, so it's up for a good 2025. Now, and maybe for
Chris, how do you think about this? Like NIM's expanding pretty nicely in 2025, assuming we have a more normal
curve. Is that the time you now step up the pace of investment? You've been cutting expenses forever. Is that the
time where you step up or do you let that benefit fall to the bottom line? That's the questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, so a couple – a couple of questions in there and thank you for acknowledging no normal environment has
existed. But the structural piece, I would say, Steve, relative to Key, over the last 20 years, but particularly going
into the crisis would be, I think, the loan book profile is quite a bit different. So if you think about the quality of the
borrowers, the 55% of C&IB investment grade, the structural differences in our CRE portfolio, the largely
residential real estate collateralized kind of super prime consumer, all of those things kind of lean you toward a
little bit lower base NII just because of the quality of that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
And, Clark, I would add card as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
I think – I mean, yeah, card, which we have, but it's highly transactor-based versus balance-based. Now, given
that, you would expect credit losses to be better and then we think they will be certainly better than us historically,
but you would expect better on a relative basis.
And your other question would be okay how do you monetize those clients to make sure that you're getting the
right returns and getting business on it? We think we do that really well in the commercial business. We think
we're doing that better and better as you go down market, and commercial with things like payments, and we
think we're getting much better on wealth, and building the wealth business in the consumer space. So we think
we're building those capabilities, and have the opportunity to do that, but I do think if you look back over time,
there's probably a base structural nature of NII that's a little bit lower given the quality of the portfolio, and that's
very intentional.
You've heard Chris talk about that at length. We have been tight on expenses. We've been doing that largely to
maintain our ability to invest and the short answer is hard to predict exactly what we do. I think it's a function of
how much expansion do we see, how much investment capacity does that create, and frankly, how much high-

quality investments are there in front of us. Our first investments are always going to be in good clients and our
people, and then in this world, you've got to continue to invest in technology.
I actually think on an infrastructure basis, we've done a really good job over that – on that over the last decade,
and we'll continue to do that, but we're going to continue to make sure that we can invest and build the franchise
the way we need to be competitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
And from a organic growth perspective, Steve, we obviously were doing our typical level of investment last year,
but where you'll see us lean in, you'll see us lean into our unique integrated corporate and investment bank where
we've had a lot of success recruiting people. I mentioned earlier our $55 billion of AUM. We think that platform is
eminently leverageable. We'll be investing in that. I mentioned also payments. And then lastly, I also mentioned
business banking. Those are the areas where you'll see us leaning in from an investment perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it, okay. If I can ask one other question. So, Chris, it's interesting to hear you're so bullish on credit, and I say
that because if you listen to every other person they have on CNBC, all they point to is all this pressure coming on
commercial real estate to a regional bank like you guys.
Can you just say to the investors that are on the line right now, what's happening? I mean you've had commercial
real estate loans come up for renewal in the fourth quarter. I know you have a large office portfolio, but I'm sure
some of them came up for renewal. What's happening? Are you able to renew because the LTV, like you said,
was 60%? You put a higher cap rate, they're getting renewed? There's a perception that it's nothing more than
[ph] extended pretend, (01:08:41) and you're just – the banks are just kicking the can down the road. So I'd love
to hear your view on what's now happening as these loans are coming up for renewal. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well – and you've got to look backwards a bit. And first of all, we had outsized losses in real estate during
the financial crisis and we said we'd never do that again. And we literally ripped the business down to the studs,
and rebuilt it, and rebuilt it around an underwrite-to-distribute model, so Fannie, Freddie, FHA, the life companies,
the CMBS market. We also said we're only going to finance the best real estate people in the right sectors in the
right geographies, and so we've been very, very prescriptive.
So we distributed a bunch. 13% of our total loan book is in real estate. What's happening on the ground is
because of the people that we're financing, when we go through the math, and because of the rise in interest
rates, because they qualify then as a criticized loan, we go to them, and we ask them for an interest reserve, and
they give it to us. So, what is going on on the ground with us, I'm not sure it's representative of the whole market,
but it's been – it's the work that we did starting 10 years ago that really has put us in the position that we're in
now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Maybe unique, but still nonetheless, not the overhang that maybe some are being led to believe. Okay.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Sorry for the late question here. Congrats to both Vern and Brian. Just one on expenses and efficiency.
You guys did a great job last year, taking the actions to continue to head towards stable-ish expenses. I'm just
wondering how much more flex you have in there in terms of things you can continue to do to offset the expected
investments that you continue to talk about and need to make and can you keep that stable trajectory as you look
further out? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks for the question, Ken. Whenever I'm talking to our team, I tell everybody we're all risk managers, we're all
responsible for revenue, and we're all responsible for managing expenses. We're spending, as I mentioned, about
$1.1 billion a quarter. There are always things that we can do better to create the raw material to continue to
invest. And in our business, unfortunately, the real cost is people. And if you look point-to-point, we have 1,369
less people on the team today than we did a year ago. And obviously, that will pull through. It's also you get a –
you also get a big pickup when you exit businesses like we did in vendor finance where you can take out front,
middle, and back office. So, we did a lot of the heavy lifting, Ken, last year. I don't see that level of heavy lifting
continuing, but it's something that we just have to stay after every single day. Thanks for the question.

Good morning, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
I was hoping you could give some color on the sentiment you're hearing from your clients. For the soft landing
scenario to play out, it seems like we would need to see the disinflation trends not just continue from here, but
there would also need to be a reacceleration in loan growth, and I guess maybe first, do you agree with that? And
if so, how likely do you think we are to see loan growth reacceleration from here based on what you're seeing and
hearing from your clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I think it goes back to – it goes back to inflation. Is – and is inflation really under control, and if it isn't, what actions
will the Fed be required to take or not take, given what the forwards are saying in order to get inflation under
control. Right now, our customers are in good shape. As you know, the job market is in good shape. Interesting
data point, and one of the reasons I think inflation is going to be stickier than people think. Our non-interest-
bearing customers today have 33% more dollars in their account than they did pre-pandemic. So, I just feel like –
so I think that's a risk. And so, if we get – if we get a soft landing, I think there'll be opportunities for loan growth.
We've – in our planning, we're assuming a short recession in 2024 for all the reasons I just described.
