Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event
is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kristin Silberberg
Executive Vice President-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of second quarter results referencing our
presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take
questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are
also here to provide additional color.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that
might cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures. So, it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix.
And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through
the second quarter driving forward on key initiatives in both Consumer and Commercial, accelerating our digital
transformation, making steady progress on TOP 6, and announcing the acquisition of HSBC's East Coast
branches and online bank. The diversity and resilience of our business model was evident as record revenue in
Capital Markets and Wealth partially offset a sizable drop in Mortgage. Our credit results continue to be excellent
given further improvement in the economy.
The headline numbers for the quarter with EPS of $1.46 and ROTCE of 17.7% were flattered by a sizeable
reserve release. Importantly, we feel PPNR has now bottomed and growth should resume in the second half. We
achieved 1% average loan growth in the quarter, a little less than projected, as pay downs on PPP loans and
across the back-book in Commercial offset generally good levels of originations. We did a nice job on expenses
protecting the areas aligned with our growth initiatives while delivering on our expense efficiencies associated
with TOP.
Looking out to the second half, we believe we will see a pickup in loan growth, particularly on the Consumer side
in student, point-of-sale finance and auto. In Commercial, we should start to see gradual growth in line utilization
off of low levels, along with a pickup in deal-related financings. Mortgage revenues should rebound modestly
given hedge losses in Q2 and generally strong production, while Capital Markets pipelines remain healthy. We

expect a return to positive operating leverage in both Q3 and Q4. Credit should continue to be excellent. We are
now calling for further improvement in charge-offs to 20 to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 25 to 35 basis
points for the full year.
We continue to feel good about our progress and our ability to come out of the pandemic period with increasing
differentiation and growth in franchise value versus our peers over time.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We've reported
underlying net income of $656 million and EPS of $1.46. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.7%, which
includes the impact of a sizable credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.6 billion was down slightly linked-quarter
on lower mortgage fee income, with net interest income up slightly given interest-earning asset growth. Average
loans were up 1% in the quarter on the strength of retail originations hitting an all-time high giving us good
momentum heading into the second half of the year.
These highlights include record results in Capital Markets and Wealth. Mortgage fees were lower as margins
continue to tighten, although origination volumes remain quite strong. And we continue to control expenses down
2% quarter-over-quarter. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $213 million, which reflects sustained
macroeconomic improvement and strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at
1.75%, excluding PPP loans.
And finally, we are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $168 million to
shareholders in dividends during the quarter. We also continue to grow our tangible book value per share, which
was $33.95 at quarter-end, up 6% compared with the year ago.
Next, I'll refer to a few slides and give you some key takeaways for the second quarter. I'll then outline our outlook
for the third quarter. Net interest income on slide 6 was up 1% linked-quarter given interest-earning asset growth
and higher day count. Average loans were up 1% and net interest margin was down slightly.
The net interest margin reflects lower earning-asset yields reflecting the low rate environment, spread pressures
and elevated lending competition, although improved funding mix and better deposit pricing are helping to
mitigate these factors. The interest-bearing deposit costs improved 4 basis points to 16 basis points from
continued discipline on deposit pricing.
Our asset sensitivity increased to about 10.7% from 8.5% at the end of the first quarter. The increase primarily
reflects the ongoing stability in deposit levels and the improvement in funding mix given the increase in low cost
deposits.
Referring to slide 7, we delivered solid fee results again this quarter with record results in Capital Markets and
Wealth reflecting the ongoing investments in our capabilities and the benefit of acquisitions. Mortgage fees were
down approximately $80 million this quarter, as production revenue was impacted by continued pressure on gain
on sale margins, particularly in the wholesale and correspondent channels given increased industry capacity and
competitive pressures.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
While we had expected a meaningful decline in Mortgage revenue for the quarter, it ended up greater than
expected due to two items that reduced our revenue by a combined $24 million. The first was the $14 million of
MSR valuation losses net of hedges driven by changes in implied rate volatility, which moved unexpectedly near
the end of the quarter. Also, we were impacted by a $10 million increase in linked-quarter to mortgage agency
fees retroactively applied to existing pipelines. We would not expect these impacts to recur in Q3.
Secondary originations remained strong, but we're down about 10% from first quarter levels. As expected, we are
seeing a continuing shift towards purchase originations, which increased from about 35% of the total in first
quarter to about 48% in the second quarter. Also, our third-party servicing book grew to $85 million, up 3% linked-
quarter and 6% year-over-year. And servicing contribution improved $13 million linked-quarter.
Moving on to some of our positive quarter-over-quarter fee contributors. We delivered record results from Capital
Markets and Wealth reflecting our ongoing investments in capabilities and demonstrating diversity in our fee
income. Capital Markets fees hit another high of 12% linked-quarter with loan syndication fees hitting their highest
levels since 2017. Our M&A pipeline continues to be strong at historic highs.
Additionally, Wealth fees had a new record, up 3% linked-quarter, reflecting an increase in assets under
management from net inflows with record sales and strong market levels. Finally, card fees results were strong,
up 16% linked-quarter as debit transactions and credit card spend rebounded to exceed pre-pandemic levels
given the strength in the recovery which also benefited from seasonal strength – seasonal trends.
On slide 8, expenses were well controlled, down 2% linked-quarter with seasonality in salaries and employee
benefits.
Average loans on slide 9 were up $643 million or 1% linked-quarter given the strength in our retail portfolio
offsetting a decline in Commercial. Diving into drivers a bit more. The diversity of our retail lending business
produced record high retail loan originations in the quarter, which was partially offset by elevated pay downs. This
was driven by strengthened mortgage, auto and education refinance, partially offset by planned rundown of the
personal unsecured portfolios.
Commercial was roughly flat in the quarter, excluding PPP. We had a strong origination quarter led by asset-
backed and subscription line finance, which had been steady contributors over the last few quarters. This was
offset by elevated payoff activity, which reflects highly favorable conditions for commercial companies to access
the debt capital markets.
Line utilization levels stabilized near historical – historic lows over the course of the quarter. We saw average
commitments for our middle market and mid-corporate clients grow by 2% in the second quarter after being flat in
the first quarter. This will benefit us as the economic activity drives corporate investment. Overall, spot loan
growth for the quarter before the impact of PPP forgiveness was 1.8% given strong retail and commercial
originations. This provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the second half of the year.
On slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain
strong. Average deposits were up 3% linked-quarter and 6% year-over-year with strong growth in demand
deposits. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in
low-cost categories. We are very pleased with our continued progress on deposit repricing with total deposit costs
down 3 basis points to 11 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 4 basis points to 16 basis points
during the quarter and we expect these costs to continue decreasing to low-teens or better by the end of the year.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Moving on to credit on slides 11 and 12, we saw excellent credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs dropped by
more than half as they declined from 52 basis points to 25 basis points linked-quarter driven by improvements
across the portfolio. Nonaccrual loans decreased $229 million or 23% linked-quarter with a $116 million decrease
in commercial reflecting repayments and charge-offs. Retail nonaccrual loans decreased by $113 million linked-
quarter driven by mortgage and home equity.
Given the improvement in outlook and performance of the portfolio, our reserves decreased ending the quarter at
1.75%, excluding PPP loans, compared with 2.03% at the end of the first quarter.
Moving to slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength, increasing our CET1 ratio from 10.1% in the
first quarter to 10.3% at the end of the second quarter after returning $168 million in capital to shareholders
through dividends in the quarter. We paused our stock repurchases in the second quarter in anticipation of strong
second half loan growth and the HSBC transaction, which are expected closing in the first quarter of 2022 will use
about 24 basis points of capital.
We have the opportunity to resume repurchases in the second half with about $660 million of capacity remaining
under our current board authorization. The pace and magnitude of repurchases will consider the strength of
organic growth as well as the potential for fee-based acquisitions while managing CET1 to within our target range
of 9.75% to 10%.
Before I move on for a second quarter outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across
the company on slide 14, and I should have said [ph] 3G outlook (12:55) before I move on to that. As Bruce
mentioned, we are now working on further transformational efficiency opportunities to form a TOP 7 program. For
example, based on the work we've done so far, we have further opportunities as we mature our agile delivery
model and simplify how we operate, implement the next wave of our next-gen technology program including
further rationalization of applications, and continue to optimize our branch density.
This quarter, we released our 4th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report highlighting our commitment to
advancing our environmental, social and governance goals reflecting our core values. The report provides a
snapshot of our significant progress this year, including the establishment of a formal corporate responsibility
governance framework and the completion of our first materiality assessment to more specifically define ESG
priorities.
For example, we know that it is vitally important that we help create a healthy and sustainable future and we are
committed to reducing our impact on the environment. Therefore, consistent with international accords, we have
set ambitious targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from operations by 30% by 2025 and 50% by
2035.
The last item I'll cover on this page is the acquisition of HSBC's East Coast branches and online deposit
franchise. There is a recap of the transaction on slide 15, so I won't rehash all the details other than to reiterate
the attractive entry this provides us in the important New York City Metro, Washington DC, and South Florida
markets.
A sizable customer base and solid deposit franchise provide a springboard for our consumer national expansion
strategy. In addition, the $7 billion net deposit position provides a significant long-term funding flexibility in support
of our attractive loan growth opportunities.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
And now, for some high level commentary on the outlook on slide 17. We expect NII to be up 2% to 3% with NIM
up low-to-mid single digits with our outlook based on a 10-year treasury rate expectation at 1.35% for the third
quarter. We expect average loans to be up slightly in the third quarter with spot loans up about 2% to 3%. Earning
assets are expected to be broadly stable in the third quarter.
We are well-positioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the second half and into 2022, particularly given
the continued strength we are seeing in mortgage, education refi and auto, as well as the seasonal benefits
expected for in-school and point-of-sale lending in the third quarter.
In Commercial, we expect a slower recovery and utilization rates off historic lows with modest growth over the
second half of the year led by asset-backed subscription lines and deal-related financings. Fee income is
expected to be up 2% to 4%, reflecting improvement in mortgage banking results and other categories as the
economic recovery continues, partially offset by seasonal impacts in Capital Markets.
Noninterest expense is expected to be up slightly in the third quarter. We expect net charge-offs will be in the
range of 20 to 25 basis points of average loans with the provision less than net charge-offs. With a substantial
improvement in credit, we expect that net charge-offs will be in the range of 25 to 35 basis points for the full year,
down from our prior outlook of 35 to 45 basis points.
To wrap up, this was a solid quarter for Citizens with good momentum heading into the back half of the year. Our
expectation is that PPNR will grow quarterly in the second half of the year with positive operating leverage each
quarter.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I saw a few references to TOP 7, so – in your press release. So, I was actually hoping you could talk a little bit
more about what we might expect from the new TOP 7 program and also how it might differ from TOP 6? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure, Ken. It's John here. Yeah. I mean I think as you've seen over the years, it's just been part of our culture to
really dig in on this kind of mindset of continuous improvement. And last year, TOP 6 was somewhat unique and
its transformational sort of two-year profile. We're very pleased with how that played out delivering on the
expectations of $400 million to $425 million in run rate save. So, we're excited about that. And there was a lot of
traditional kind of top contributors in TOP 6 and there was the – a transformational aspect to it. So, that made it a
little bit unique.
I think TOP 7 may bring us back to some of that foundational sort of continuous approach to driving efficiencies.
And a couple of areas that we're looking at, sort of looking at a round two, some of the areas that we were able to
sort of drive in TOP 6, such as agile delivery and simplifying how we were operating. Next-gen tech has another,
call it, next wave of rationalizing applications associated with it. So, I think you could see sort of a 2.0 and
revisiting some of the transformational areas of TOP 6.
But then just continuing on our bread and butter to try to simplify how we operate and fundamentals around how
we manage the place. And I'd suggest that maybe there's some more room to go on optimizing branch density.
But really, just getting back to what we do which is driving continuous improvement year-over-year.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Bruce, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your M&A strategy. You know, obviously, you just announced
the HSBC brands deal and have done some few deals. But there were, I guess, some interviews and quotes from
you a few weeks back about being more open to bank deals, I think. So, maybe just update us on your thinking
there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. So, Matt, I think we've been very clear all along that we have some great strategic initiatives that should
lead to very good organic growth for Citizens and that's kind of top of the heap in terms of priorities. We've
focused next on fee-based bolt-on acquisitions and with some success, I think, you're seeing the results in our
commercial business now that we've kind of incorporated M&A capabilities into our offerings to our customer base
and the mortgage acquisition clearly was thoughtful and well-timed. And then, the wealth Clarfeld acquisition has
been a homerun in terms of opening up cross-sell particularly to our commercial business owners. So, we will –
we are pursuing more of those. And so, I feel good that there'll be some announcements over the course of the
second half of the year in that regard. So, stay tuned there.
With respect to full bank acquisitions, I think the first step here was this HSBC transaction, which I think
strategically, makes good sense for us and also financially is very attractive and compelling. And so, one of the
things that we like about that is that it fills in some geographical holes that we have, particularly the New York
Metro area and pushes this down a little bit Mid-Atlantic South towards Washington and then gets us a
beachhead in South Florida. So, those are all things that I think fit well with our distribution strategy.
And if we could find potentially other bank transactions that fit that bill that potentially could strengthen the
footprint and help our distribution strategy, and we can get it at the right price and it's the right culture and meets
the strategy, et cetera, with compelling financial economics, we'd be open to that. I don't think it's something that
again is a driving desire here. I think it will be a bit opportunistic. If we can find a good deal, we would certainly
consider it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask on the outlook, a couple of things about the NII side. John, last
quarter, you had mentioned that you expected flat earning assets and we continued to see the strong deposit
growth come through. And I'm just wondering again you're calling for flat earnings assets, but looks like the
deposit growth remains pretty strong for the industry and for you guys. So, just wondering what are you seeing
there and expecting in terms of overall deposit growth and why that would only result in flattish earning assets?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Yeah. I mean, I think that we've been for some time now thinking that with economic activity you'd start to see
potentially some of those deposits to flatten out. They've just been continuing to grow and we've seen strong
flows. I'd say what's been nice about that is that's been coming in the categories we want them to show up and
meeting demand deposits have been really strong underpinning all of that. So, that's been quite good.
I think the – and what that's resulted in is continuing to allow us to run our deposit playbook and you're seeing our
interest-bearing deposit costs decline and headed towards really low-teens or even better by the end of the year.
So, that's been great.
I do think that as you see economic recovery in the second half of the year, we would suspect that some of that
growth will begin to moderate and possibly even some of it begin to run off. But we have – most of that surge
deposits that we saw in 2020 and early 2021, we think it's going to stick around. So, as much as two-thirds or
more. And then, that's great fuel and great support for what we expect to see later in the year which is loan growth
and as you get into 2022, lots of momentum. So, those are some of the thoughts I have on the deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add to that Ken that the spot numbers are quite optimistic. So, I think we had a record level of
originations for loans in the consumer side. In the second quarter, we had a very strong level of that in
commercial which goes back to pre-pandemic level of originations. We're still seeing relatively high pay downs
which mutes that a little bit.
But I think when we look out into Q3, in particular, we have a bunch of seasonal strength in businesses like
student and point-of-sale combined with I think those pay downs should start to moderate a little bit. So, we're
quite optimistic that we'll see very, very strong spot loan growth that should kick in, in Q3 and extend into Q4. The
average is based on timing of when this all happens may not fully reflect that in Q3. But I would stay focused on
the spot number.

Operator: Your next question will come from David George with Baird. Go ahead please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question on PPP. Could you disclose the dollar amount of PPP loans in the quarter?
And then, I've got a follow-up on the outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean it's basically at the end of the quarter, the average balances during 2Q was about $4 billion – $4.5
billion, $4.6 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And then with respect to the Q3 outlook, particularly specifically on fees, it looks like
you're expecting a fairly nice jump in fee activity and I trust part of that's going to come from mortgage. John, I
thought – I think you said $14 million relative to Q2 that is of that $85 million number was MSR related. Then
there was a $10 million agency fee impact. Was there anything else that impacted that number? I'm just trying to
get a sense as to how much of a balance you're expecting over the next quarter or two.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think – yeah, that's right. As I mentioned in my remarks, there's about $24 million of unique items
that feels unique to 2Q. And so, that's something that'll set us up nicely for 3Q, starting with that without expecting
those things to recur.
We do think that in the third quarter volumes will help – will hold up. And we may have some modest decline in
gain – on gain on sale margins, but given what's going on with those sort of nonrecurring items from 2Q as well as
still a strong volume quarter that we do think that mortgage rebounds into the third quarter.

Operator: Your next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Just on the loan front, I know you mentioned that you're seeing some loan competition around
loan pricing. So, I just wondered if you can elaborate on that and what areas are you seeing it? And if you could
maybe give us some color in terms of your new production loan yields in the various areas that would be helpful.
Then, I have a follow-up on capital. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Hey, John. It's Don McCree. We definitely are seeing price competition in terms of competition across the
board. So, part of the reason that our loan growth is a little bit more tepid than it might be as we're trying to stay
pretty disciplined on price and terms. So, down maybe 10 basis points or something is what I'm seeing generally
in terms of price – spreads across the board.
I think just elaborating on what John and Bruce have said on loan growth, we're out with our clients in person now
which is actually quite gratifying. And the thing that's kind of restricting utilization is all these supply chain backups
and some of the labor. And as those begin to clear, particularly labor, we think clears up towards the September
timeframe. And the supply chain begins to normalize towards the fourth quarter-ish, we would expect more
normal working capital build to resume. So, that's what gives me a lot of confidence.
And then, as John said, we've got about, our entire downdraft in spot loan growth in the quarter was PPP
repayments and that's going to begin to moderate. So, there's some headwinds that we've been sailing into which
should clear themselves out and give us some good momentum as we move into the backend. But we're going to
stay disciplined on terms, and price, and credit.

Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Similar on consumer, I'd say ex-PPP spot balances were up just shy of 3%. So, a pretty decent growth
overall despite, as Bruce pointed out, some run down in the back-book. We're seeing really good strength and
record originations, really the highest level of originations we've had since we're a public company here in Q2. So,

the momentum should continue in the second half of the year. And then as both Bruce and John pointed out,
adding an iUp, the Apple iPhone upgrade program, which is typically a late summer early fall event. And then, the
seasonality of in-school lending should really give us another round of growth heading into the second half of the
year.
But pricing has been really competitive in a couple of fronts, in particular, student loan refinancing as rates had
ticked up and now are starting to peel back a little bit. That's been a particular place of intensity. I'd say on assets
like auto, while pricing intensity has picked up a little bit, spread still remain pretty high. So, we're looking at that
business still as a double-digit ROE business right now with originations, which is elevated from normalized levels
in auto given the short duration. So, we're able to hit record originations in auto as an example with still somewhat
elevated yields, which has been really, really good. So, I'm optimistic.
Actually, the last point, home equity, which is probably a little bit unique from what you're hearing against peers.
We've been really, really strong in originations for home equity. In fact, we're seeing some benchmarking that puts
us in probably the top two or three lenders across the US, although only operating in 11 states right now for home
equity lending. This quarter, the spot balances actually grew. And from a quarterly basis, that's the first time since
the financial crisis we've seen net loan growth in home equity and our credit card book is also bottomed. So,
some of these de-levering trends with all the stimulus out there in the market with consumers I think in our line of
credit products have hit the bottom or starting to see signs that those are turning. So, hopefully, a tailwind as we
look – think about H2.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
[indiscernible] (30:59) John. It's such a unique name. Yeah. I mean I think you were also – you were just kind of
asking about yields, and in the second quarter, we were able to see origination yields up in the retail side of things
due to a number of – due to the diversity of the portfolio. And we suspect that that may – that's something that we
may see continue into the third quarter with origination yields rising, and that tends to temper the front-book, back-
book dynamic that I think maybe we're trying to get after.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
No, that's helpful. Thank you so much for all that. And then on capital, I know you saw some good strengthening
in the CET1 to 10.3%. First, if you could just maybe talk about how you think about that target of 9.75% to 10%. I
mean we're starting to see some of your peers nudge down their targets, their internal targets a bit. I wanted to
get your thoughts on that. Is there room to potentially adopt a lower level there on the CET1 internal target?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Well, we're comfortable with that 9.75% to 10%. As you know, over time we brought that down. It was
10.25%, then it was 10% to 10.25% and then it was 10% and it's 9.75% to 10%. So, I think as we've matured as a
company, as we've demonstrated good risk discipline in how we've grown the loan book and you can see we've
come through the pandemic with a low level of credit losses. I think some of that "new guy" a little bit of
conservatism we had coming off the IPO, we're starting to shed that and move back closer to where peer targets
are. So, for now, we're above the 9.75% to 10%. So, I don't see any real burning desire to change it. But over
time, certainly, if the pack moves down a little bit, we have plenty of room versus our SCB target. And certainly, I
think the risk profile would permit that.

Operator: Your next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. It doesn't – I just want to ask about the swaps hedging. It doesn't look like you added any swaps
this quarter. And I'm just wondering what the plan is going forward. I do know rates are obviously lower. I'm just
wondering what level rates need to get to before you think maybe adding some more swaps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We actually did add some swaps this quarter, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Oh, you did?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, we added maybe, call it, $1 billion or so. And we added $1 billion or so later in the quarter and
actually $1 billion right at the beginning of the quarter. So, really right around $2 billion. You add that to the $6
billion we executed late in the first quarter and we've got around $8 billion that we've added as part of our, call it,
sort of early stage kind of dollar cost averaging into what the rate environment.
And when you look at the overall averages, we did that, call it, mid to high-70s on average, which is mid to high-
70 basis points, 75 to 80 basis points on that overall portfolio and in the five years sort of well below that today.
So, and the last couple of billion was, I think, over 90 basis...

Over 90 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It was over 90 basis points. So, I think that we've been able to start to look opportunistically at ways to
really sort of monetize some of that asset sensitivity over time. And we're still over 10%, actually close to 11%
asset sensitivity. So, there's lots of opportunity to continue to add to the swap portfolio as and when the rate
environment continues to improve. And our year-over-year headwind from swap has declined significantly and
markedly as a result of all these actions. So, I think we're – I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of the swap
portfolio.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead, please.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.

Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I've got two questions. First, for you, John. Can you give us some color? I noticed in your outlook you indicated
that you guys think that the 10-year or the expectation for the 10-year will be 1.35%. Currently, today, as you
know, it's well below that. If it comes in at 1.15% for the quarter, what will that do to the net interest margin
assumptions that you have in net interest income?
And then second for you, Bruce, the President obviously came out with the Executive Order on M&A to scrutinize
deals more closely. Does that raise the risk of your HSBC deal at all? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and knock off the first part of that, Gerard. In terms of – so we've gotten through a few weeks
of the quarter where rates were a little higher. We do have an expectation of an average of 1.35% for the quarter.
If it were to drop off, call it, into that range, maybe we would see, call it, $5 million-ish or so of impact to NII,
maybe 1 basis point or 2 basis points on NIM. But I hasten to add that there are offsets in puts and takes when
you're operating in an environment like that.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
More broadly, you could find better opportunities in terms of offsetting that on the deposit side. You could also
see, as we've demonstrated back, in the crisis and in the pandemic, the resilience of the franchise broadly even
beyond the net interest income and what the downside rate protection that the mortgage company actually
provides, which is extremely powerful. So I think that, maybe there's a modest impact from a first order effect if
the 10-year stays down there. But I think we have mitigants in terms of – on the deposit side and then more
broadly in the fee area.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Part two of that, Gerard. I don't see the Biden Executive Order impacting the HSBC transaction. So, that's a
relatively modest in size transaction, that's straightforward. And in any case, the EO is out for comment. It's going
to take quite a while to settle that one down. And more broadly, I think bank mergers are probably amongst the
most heavily scrutinized as it is. So, whether there is a meaningful impact down the track on that remains to be
seen. But certainly, as it relates to the HSBC transaction, I don't see any impact at all.

Operator: Your next question will be from David Konrad with KBW. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes. Good morning. It sounds like definitely very positive on loan growth trends, maybe more spot than average
because of timing. But just curious I think historically you've talked about a mid-single digit to high-single digit full-
year spot loan growth. I just wondered if you're still comfortable with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean I think that's right. I mean when you look at – look at where we're coming out just in the second
quarter in terms of spot, you can – you see that, that momentum that's being generated and then that's continuing
into the third quarter with the 2% to 3% guide that we highlighted. I think you absolutely could get to that. And the
expectation is to get to that mid-single digit range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I think I'd hasten to add when you look at it, excluding PPP, that's an important metric to look at when you're
considering the underlying fundamental flows that we're seeing both in commercial and consumer. And you know,
we're...

math from that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So, one of the aspects, I think, that's unique to us is just the number of sales we set out to catch the win when
there's some win. So, we have a very broad lending portfolio on the consumer side, and we play in some very
attractive verticals on the commercial side. So, broadly feel good that we can certainly get to nominal GDP growth
on a recurring basis.
