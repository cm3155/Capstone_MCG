Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the
leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. Our 2020 results demonstrate that we're driving revenue
growth despite headwinds. We're focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain
both market share and share of wallet.
We are investing in customer-centric products, services, and digital technology that will drive sustainable growth
and outperformance both today and for years to come. Huntington operates in intentionally diversified business
model, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides a good mix of revenue and credit exposure.
We built a competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products
and services.
We are committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking app, which has been
recognized as the highest in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power two years in a row. In 2020, we introduced
several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers' needs and differentiate
Huntington from the competition.
We are not done. We have a pipeline of innovative products and features that we will release throughout the year.
We have a proven track record of solid execution, adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to

drive shareholder returns. This allowed us to deliver our eighth consecutive year of positive operating leverage in
2020.
Our focused execution has and will enable us to ensure investments in the products, people and digital
capabilities, which will drive sustainable long-term growth and outperformance. We are particularly excited about
the TCF acquisition we announced last month, which provides additional scale and growth opportunities.
We filed the bank regulatory applications last week and announced the planned consolidation of 198 branches.
We are making good progress on our preparations for integration later this year. We remain on track with the
previously announced schedule. We expect the closing date late in the second quarter. We are pleased with our
2020 results and continued momentum across the bank despite an extraordinarily challenging operating
environment, and I'm incredibly proud of the outstanding efforts of our colleagues to overcome the challenges of
the pandemic as well as look out for our customers.
For the year, we grew revenues 3%, loans 6%, and core deposits 11%. While bottom line results and EPS were
down due to elevated provisioning required under the CECL reserve accounting, our pre-tax, pre-provision
earnings increased 4%, and these are all very strong results.
We also closed the year with strengthening commercial loan production as expected in the fourth quarter. Our
consumer lending businesses, especially home lending and vehicle finance, are continuing to provide very good
loan originations. Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for the second consecutive
year. Our deposit growth parallels the entire banking system and we do not foresee this changing any time soon.
Our balance sheet is very well-positioned with robust capital liquidity and our hedging strategy has reduced
interest rate risk. 2020 also marked the 10th consecutive year of an increased cash dividend.
Credit quality continues to improve, illustrating that our decisive and conservative actions in the second quarter
appropriately identified the highest risk portions of our portfolio allowing us to proactively work with our customers.
As we entered 2021, I'm very encouraged not only by our momentum, but also the underlying strengths I see in
our local economies. Economic data shows that our footprint is recovering more quickly than the nation as a
whole and our conversations with our customers support this.
The unemployment rate in November was below the national average in five of our seven states, including our
largest market in Ohio at 5.7%. Over 2.9 million jobs were created in our footprint between April and November,
which means 24% of the national total were created in these seven states. Further, 44% of all manufacturing jobs
created during this period occurred in our footprint states. The V-shaped manufacturing recovery is fueling
regional economic growth even though many manufacturers continue to face challenges from supply chain
disruptions, skilled labor shortages and periodic plant shutdowns related to the virus.
These inventory challenges are visible in the auto, RV, and marine industries and then form our belief that
continued low dealer floor plan utilization rates could take at least several more quarters to return to longer term
averages.
The recovery in unemployment boosted both the region's consumer confidence and consumer retail spending
above the respective 2020 national averages. Home prices continued to appreciate, especially with solid
increases in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Indiana. The Midwest also led the country in year-over-year
growth in single-family home sales in the third quarter, up 56% compared to 39% for the nation.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Turning to our business, we're also seeing momentum. We saw an uptick in commercial loan activity late in the
fourth quarter consistent with our prior guidance. We are also seeing continued strength in consumer lending. As
we entered the first quarter, our commercial pipelines also are up from a year ago.
We expect consumer lending to remain strong and commercial activity to continue to improve over the course of
the year. The consistently high level of execution we're seeing across our businesses, strengthening commercial
activity and constructive economic outlook are driving our strategy to accelerate investments, leaning into the
recovery to drive increasing growth over the intermediate term. It also informed our decision to pursue and
ultimately enter into the TCF acquisition.
Let me now turn it over to Zach for an overview of our financial performance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slides 4 and 5 provide the financial highlights for the full-year 2020
and the fourth quarter, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27.
Return on average assets was 1.04% and return on average tangible common equity was 13.3%. Results
continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense, although it was down meaningfully from
the third quarter.
Now, let's turn to slide 6 to review our results in a little bit more detail. Annual pre-tax, pre-provision earnings
growth was 4% for 2020. We believe this is very solid performance in light of the low interest rate environment
and the economic challenges inflicted by the pandemic, illustrating the underlying earnings power of the bank and
the strategies we're executing.
Turning to the fourth quarter, pre-tax, pre-provision earnings increased 6% year-over-year. Total revenue
increased 7% versus last year with 81% of growth balanced between spread revenues and fee income – sorry,
$81 million of growth balance between spread revenue and fee income. Home lending was a particular bright spot
in 2020 and that remained true this quarter, continuing to drive fee income growth of 10%. Our capital markets,
wealth and investment management, card and payments, and insurance businesses all posted continued growth
in the fourth quarter.
I should also note the deposit service charges remained below the year-ago level and elevated customer deposit
account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $55 million or 8%
from the year-ago quarter. Approximately $31 million or more than 4 percentage points of this growth was driven
by increased technology investments. Another $20 million or 3 percentage points was a donation to the Columbus
Foundation that we made at the year-end. The remaining percentage point was primarily as a net result of several
unusual items, including TCF legal costs and debt extinguishment costs. The underlying run rate of all other
expenses was relatively flat.
Turning to slide 7, FTE net interest income increased 6% as earning asset growth more than offset year-over-year
growth – year over year NIM compression. As we've stated previously, our main focus is driving risk-adjusted
returns and revenue growth. In order to achieve this, we've taken actions to sustain net interest income growth,
some of which as previously discussed will also help us manage our NIM around current level for the foreseeable
future.
On a linked-quarter basis, the NIM decreased 2 basis points to 2.94%. As shown in the reconciliation on the right
side of the slide, the linked quarter decreased, primarily reflected the 3-basis point impact of a change in PPP
5

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
loan terms to delay the initial repayment. This revenue recognition accounting change had not been anticipated in
the original Q4 guidance.
The other NIM drivers shown on the slide essentially offset each other to keep the NIM stable to slightly higher,
consistent with the expectations we provided on last quarter's earnings call. The anticipated forgiveness of the
majority of the first round of PPP loans over the next two quarters is expected to provide a near-term boost to net
interest income and NIM on a GAAP basis during those periods from the accelerated loan fee recognition.
As we have discussed previously, we're taking actions now on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the
inherent pressure caused on the margin by prolonged interest rate, low interest rate environment, managing the
interest margin near current levels on an underlying basis.
On the earning asset side, we're optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing disciplined pricing as well as
loan production in certain higher yielding asset classes. We also expect to deploy an additional $2 billion of
excess liquidity into securities, picking up incremental yield. Lastly, we expect to continue to reduce our funding
costs, including further optimization of wholesale funding.
Moving to slide 8, average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven
by $6 billion of PPP loans and $5 billion increase in the aforementioned deposits at the Federal Reserve. Average
commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On
a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans increased modestly, notably benefiting from strong production and asset-based
lending. In addition, we saw commercial line utilization trends stabilized and auto floor plan utilization modestly
increased during the quarter. Consumer lending continues to produce steady growth with residential mortgage,
RV, marine and indirect auto all posting year-over-year growth. On a linked-quarter basis, average earning asset
growth primarily reflected the $1 billion or 5% increase in average securities as we executed our plan to get
securities back above the first quarter of 2020 quarter-end level by the end of 2020.
Turning to slide 9, we will review the deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 16% year-on-
year and 2% sequentially. These increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to PPP loans
and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn. Consumer growth largely related to
government stimulus and similar elevated liquidity maintenance behaviors as well as increased consumer and
business banking account production with reduced account attrition.
Slide 10 highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations
and debit card spend. These are key indicators of behavior and economic activity among our customers. As you
can see on the top left chart, after remaining relatively stable for the prior several months, commercial loan
balances excluding PPP closed the year positively, thanks to strong production in December as expected. Even
following this flurry of activity at the year-end, our pipelines today are higher than they were a year ago before the
pandemic. As previously mentioned, expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates provide
additional opportunity, which will help offset in the near-term headwind from 2020 PPP loans as they're forgiven
and repaid over the next two quarters.
There were $225 million of PPP loans forgiven in the fourth quarter. It's still too early to have a definitive view on
the new phase of PPP, but we do expect that the changes in the program that narrow the universe of small
business is eligible to participate. We expect that the ultimate size of the new PPP loan production to be smaller
than the Phase 1 that we achieved in 2020.

The top right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors I mentioned
previously, providing an attractive source of liquidity. The bottom two charts relate to customer activity driving two
of our key fee income lines. Mortgage banking salable originations remain historically robust, particularly when
taking into account the normal seasonality decline in Q4. On the bottom right, we continue to see solid year-over-
year growth in both debit card transaction and spend. Aside from the brief period of turbulence of the initial
imposition of stay at home and other restrictions in Q4, in the early days of January, we've actually seen a further
acceleration of debit spending driven by the recent stimulus payment that is similar to the trend we saw earlier in
2020 during the first round of stimulus.
Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity Tier 1 ratio or
CET1 ended the quarter at 10%, up slightly from last quarter. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the
quarter at 7.16%, down 11 basis points sequentially. Both ratios remain within our operating guidelines and our
strong capital level has positioned us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities.
Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich?

Richard A. Pohle
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Zach. Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the
disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this
downturn with solid performance. This was due to the foundation we've been laying for a decade now, beginning
with instilling a cohesive culture that everyone in the company owns risk. We reduced our commercial real estate
portfolio from over 200% of capital to under 80% and curtailed preconstruction lending such that the fourth quarter
represent the lowest level of construction in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of capital that we've
had since the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016. We slowed leverage lending originations in 2019 and ended 2020
with leverage loans virtually flat from year-end 2018. We transitioned our healthcare portfolio to diversify away
from long-term care into our publicly held products and services companies and investment-grade hospital
systems, which together now make up 45% of the healthcare portfolio.
On the consumer side, we brought our expertise in indirect auto to our RV, marine business, reduced our
exposure to second-lien high-LTV home equity. These steps and many others have fundamentally transformed
the makeup of the Huntington loan portfolios since the last downturn. I'm also extremely pleased with the impact
of our 2020 portfolio management activities. First, we reduced our oil and gas portfolio by $780 million or 59%
since September 2019. The non-core portion of this portfolio has been reduced to just $243 million. We performed
a thorough portfolio review in 2Q that resulted in a net $1.1 billion increase to our criticized loans and put
heightened visibility on this and other high-impact credits. Since 2Q, we've been able to reduce our crit class by
$771 million by working with our customers while at the same time effectively managing risk.
Finally, our total consumer and commercial delinquency numbers are better than a year ago. We managed nearly
$6 billion of loans with payment deferrals, ending the year with just $217 million of loans with the remaining
deferral.
Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides the walk through allowance for credit losses from
year-end 2019 to year-end 2020. You can see our ACL now represents 2.29% of loans. The fourth quarter
allowance represents a modest $12 million reserve release from the third quarter. Like the previous quarters in
2020, there are multiple data points used besides the provision expense for the fourth quarter. The primary
economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the November baseline forecast.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
This scenario was much improved from the August baseline forecast we used in 3Q and assumes unemployment
in 2020 ending the year at 7.2% and increasing to 7.5% for the first three quarters of 2021 to average 7.4% for the
entire year.
2020 GDP ends the full year down 3.6% and demonstrates 4.1% growth for all of 2021 with that growth peaking
at 5.8% in the fourth quarter. While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have improved
as that many of our credit metrics for the quarter, there were still many uncertainties to deal with at December 31.
The impact of the COVID resurgence we face today, smaller-than-expected economic stimulus package and
ongoing model challenges related to COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining coverage ratios
consistent with the third quarter is prudent when considering these factors.
Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the continued, but more limited impact federal oil and gas
portfolio has on our overall level of NPAs. We expect modest oil and gas credit impacts as we head into 2021, so
this will be the last time we break out this portfolio into our overall credit results. In Q4, we had four new NPAs
over $5 million and just one over $15 million, all COVID-related. Three of these customers are in Michigan where
the COVID restrictions have impacted their ability to reopen. As we signaled, we also saw an increase in NPAs
from our business banking portfolio. These credits were granular with only seven exposures over $1 million.
Despite this, total NPAs were reduced from the third quarter by $39 million or 6% and down from the second
quarter peak by $150 million or 21%.
Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we've provided our commercial and
consumer customers. As we forecasted on our third quarter call, the commercial deferrals have dropped
significantly and now totaled just $151 million, down from $942 million in Q3 and $5 billion at Q2. We expect to
have limited commercial deferral balances beyond SBA going forward. Commercial delinquencies are very
modest at just 15 basis points. Our consumer deferrals have largely run their course as well, down to just $66
million as of December with post-deferral performance in line with our expectations across all the portfolio
segments. Our deferrals in auto, RV, marine and home equity have nearly all lapsed and we are managing these
portfolios consistent with our pre-pandemic strategies. We expect the remaining mortgage deferrals will continue
to work their way down to a de minimis level over the next quarter.
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was
solid. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 55 basis points of average loans and leases. I'm pleased to
report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $340 million or 11% in Q4, which is on top of the $425
million or 12% reduction we saw in the third quarter. Our active portfolio management process enabled us to
identify potential problems early. Working with our customers, we continue to proactively remedy a number of
these loans. I would also add our non-performing asset ratio decreased 5 basis points linked-quarter to 69 basis
points, our second consecutive quarterly decline in NPAs. As always, we've provided additional granularity by
portfolio in the analyst package and the slides.
Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Thanks, Rich. Before we get to expectations, I want to spend a minute on our ongoing technology investments
and progress on digital engagement. Looking at slide 16 and 17, you can see a few select illustrations of our
continued progress on digital capabilities. In 2020 for example, we significantly expanded our new product
origination capabilities to mortgage, home equity, business checking and savings and small business lending.
You can also see continued growth in digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
As we've noted, we're investing in clearly defined digital development roadmaps across all our major business
lines that will help us drive momentum delivering differentiated products and features that will drive new customer
acquisition, relationship deepening with existing customers and servicing efficiencies both internally and for our
customers.
Finally, before we get to your questions, let's discuss Huntington's expectations for the full-year 2021 on a
standalone basis excluding TCF as shown on slide 18. Looking at the average balance sheet for the full-year
2021, we expect average loans to increase between 2% and 4%, reflecting modestly higher commercial loans
inclusive of PPP and mid-single digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see mid-
single digit growth in both categories.
As the economic recovery progresses, we expect continued acceleration of loan growth over the course of the
year. With respect to deposits, we expect average balance sheet growth of 5% to 7% due to the elevated levels of
commercial and consumer core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters.
Compared to the fourth quarter average balances, we expect modest deposit growth primarily among consumers
during the first half of the year before stabilizing in the second half. We expect to post full-year total revenue
growth of approximately 1% to 3% and full-year total expense growth of 3% to 5%.
With respect to revenues, we expect net interest income to be flat to modestly higher, driven by average earning
asset growth and a relatively stable NIM compared to the fourth quarter 2020 level. This guidance assumes the
positive impact from the acceleration of PPP fees in the first half of the year before settling back down in the
second half.
However, non-interest income is expected to be flat to modestly lower due to the challenging mortgage banking
comparisons, partially offset by continued growth in capital markets, card and payments and our wealth and
investment management business lines. The current economic outlook presents compelling opportunities to
invest in our businesses to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term and we intend
to capitalize on that. Expense growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by our ongoing strategic investments in
digital and technology development, marketing and select personnel ads directly related to our strategic initiatives.
The remaining underlying run rate of non-investment expenses is essentially flat. The investments we're making
are heavily front-end loaded resulting in notably higher year-over-year expense growth rates in the first half of the
year. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment around
positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation is to bring the expense run rate to a level
that is lower than the growth rate of revenue during the second half of 2021.
Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full-year 2021 net charge-offs to be around the middle
of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points with potential for some moderate quarterly
volatility. Reserve releases remain dependent upon economic recovery and related credit performance. As a
reminder, all expectations are standalone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the recently
announced acquisition of TCF.
Now, let me turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions.

I was hoping you could provide just a little more information around the inputs too in terms of your allowance
calculation. And the reason I ask that, I think most banks have this quarter seen significant improvement in their
ACL, call it, near zero or certainly negative provision expense. And from what they tell us, they're also being quite
conservative in terms of some of their assumptions around economic improvement. Would just love to try to
understand, I mean to the extent possible, like how you're thinking about your allowance differently than what they
are and kind of why your provision expense was certainly much higher than sort of the trend that we've been
seeing across the bank space this quarter? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Ken, this is Rich. I'll take that. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we used the November
base case as the kind of the driver, but we use multiple scenarios, and I think if you look at the base case
assumptions, the November base case assumption going back to December 31, 2020 where we snapped the
chalk here, a number of them are in doubt and some of them are still in doubt today as it relates to the amount of
stimulus, the COVID assumptions that are built into that. And so, as we look at not only what the economic
forecasts are saying, but some of the more qualitative and subjective assessments that we make as part of our
process, most COVID related, we didn't feel that there was enough certainty in those forecasts to rely solely on
those.
And so there was a fair amount of qualitative judgment that we put into the process like we do every quarter to
land the 229. The stimulus is still up in the air. All those other types of things, we just thought it was premature to
have a significant release. Keep in mind too that we also had loan growth in the fourth quarter, so about $10
million of our provision expense was driven by loan growth.

All right, great. No, that's helpful. [audio gap] (00:29:01) slightly related – unrelated question. So People's United
yesterday announced that they're exiting their in-store branches, the relationship they have in Stop & Shop. And
on the call, they actually made kind of a compelling case for why store branches kind of just don't make a lot
sense anymore. I know you guys have long-term contracts with Giant Eagle, et cetera, if you didn't have those
contracts, would it still make sense to have the in-store branches? Does that value proposition still work?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, this is Steve. We've been well served by the in-store branches in the past and you remember we went into
those almost a decade ago. But, last week, we announced – last week, we filed our Federal Reserve and OCC
applications, so it's Monday a week ago. And in those apps, we announced the consolidation of branches and we
have a very large in-store partnership with Meijer and Giant Eagle. But, as a result of the combination with TCF in
Michigan, we've been in a position where we're going to be consolidating 198 branches very substantially in
Michigan. And that will allow us to cycle out of the in-store branches that we have with Meijer, which we've
explained to the company just excess distribution with nearly 500 points of distribution in the State of Michigan as
a consequence of the combination.
So we are adjusting that partnership. There are other things we will look forward to doing with them, and so a few
ideas on the drawing board as well. With Giant Eagle, we have consolidated a number of branches over the last
year. There's the potential to further consolidate around in-store to traditional as we go forward. We do think the –
we've been well served by the nature of the economics around the in-store branches, but there is a changing
distribution, frankly a thinning of distribution as we move forward. And as we've seen over the past year with the
pandemic, more and more home goods delivered including groceries. And so store traffic, volumes are up and
revenues are up.
Traffic is down in preference for doing banking activities and the in-stores is changing a bit now. Having said that,
we see very, very strong performance in the TCF in-stores, which are in even denser metropolitan areas than we
have with our two partners. So we like the – we've liked the channel over time and continue to like aspects of it
and we're committed to going forward to Giant Eagle for the next several years and then we'll assess the TCF
partners as we move forward. But again, they're roughly 2.5 times, 3 times the average size of Huntington in-store
branches. They've been added a very long time. They have very patterned behavior, so I suspect we're going to
like what we see as we get further along with it.

Yeah. Hi, this is Zach. I'll take that question. Look, I think the margin outlook is to be relatively stable here over the
next several quarters and through the course of 2021. I do expect some calendarization whereby the first half of
the year will be moderately higher than the second half given PPP loan acceleration expected from the first round
of PPP. We're expecting by the way about 85% of those PPP loans from round one to be forgiven, approximately
half and half between Q1 and Q2. And so that will drive some incremental net interest margin in the first couple
quarters, but generally relatively flat over the period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, Zach. That helps. And then separately also on the margin, I know you mentioned the efforts to
support the stability of the margin. On the security side, I want to see if you can give us a bit of color around what
you're putting money into, what types of securities and what types of yields you're seeing? And then, separately,
you also mentioned that you're emphasizing growth in higher yielding asset classes. What loan areas would you
flag from that perspective? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. No problem. Great question. I'll take that. Again, this is Zach. So in Q4, as I mentioned in my script, we
brought the securities portfolio back up to Q1 levels. From endpoint to endpoint, Q3 to Q4 give you a sense of
that $2 billion of additional securities on a net basis. And the average yield we were getting on that was 1.25% to
give you a sense. Portfolio was running at 1.87%, but still a pretty solid yield. And the mix, pretty similar to what
we've invested in the past, mainly mortgage-backed. As we go into 2021, one important thing that I also said in
my prepared remarks, but I would highlight now is that we are intending to invest an additional $2 billion mostly in
the first quarter to bring the overall securities portfolio up to $24 billion as a result of this continuing to monitor and
watch the excess liquidity level and optimize the balance sheet.
Likewise, those purchases are expected to be in the mortgage-backed securities structures, most notably with a
range of yields that we're forecasting sort of between 1.20%, 1.30% so pretty similar. As we go forward, we're
watching pretty closely any new rounds of stimulus and certainly the latest round of PPP, which could cause us to
increase that goal. Over time, we'll have to see where those land, but that's kind of where we're running with
those. I'll pause for a second and move on to the other element you – other aspect of the question you asked in
terms of what assets we're looking at.

Just taking a step back on our balance sheet optimization program, we are very confident in it. We're already
starting to see the traction of it and split about half and half from funding optimization in that asset growth mix
optimization. And when you think about the asset growth mix optimization, it's really focused on higher yielding
products like Small Business Administration production where we're, as you know, the nation's leading producer
and also commercial categories like equipment finance, asset-based lending. Those are really the biggest focus
areas that I would call out for you as a headline.

R. Scott Siefers Q

Hey. Was hoping you might walk through the sort of the tweak to net charge-off guidance from last month. I
mean, it certainly seems clear that credit concerns are kind of melting away for the industry, but just sort of over
the past six weeks, what in your mind has changed to take you from sort of the upper half of the through the cycle
range to sort of lowering that band as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's Rich. I'll be happy to take that. It was a few things. One, we just got more visibility on the post deferral
experience that we've seen on both our consumer and commercial customers. And as those deferrals are winding
down, there's really no lagging credit impact that we saw there. The other piece of it is just continued strength in
the oil and gas sector. We had a lot of charge-off activity in 2020. We do not expect to see charge-offs of that
magnitude, certainly of that magnitude in 2021, so we brought that forecast down a little bit. But generally, we're
seeing some decent traction with our commercial customers and the consumer book continues to perform very
well. So those were the major things. We tweaked the guidance I think is the right way to say it. We didn't – it
wasn't a wholesale change, but we do feel better about the portfolio heading into 2021.

Rich, if you don't mind, I'll add to that, Scott. Year-end delinquencies better than a year ago pre-COVID on the
commercial side, the multiple quarters now of lower NPAs, lower crit class, the economic outlook, the combination
of factors. And I think the oil and gas component of our charge-offs last year were mid-teens like 16 bps, 17 bps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
17 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
17 bps. So that's eliminated. We don't expect to have oil and gas charge-offs. And then the high-risk industries
continue to look good. We obviously spend a lot of time on those every quarter. So at various times during the
quarter, especially as we get to quarter-end, there's a lot of deeper review that's triggered and frankly looks good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. Thank you for that. And then the final question was, Zach, you talked a couple times about
optimization of wholesale funding. Just curious as you look through the course of the year, maybe some color on
the kind of opportunities or options you have there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think it'll be kind of more of the same of what we've talked about before, which is leveraging the really
strong liquidity and deposit gathering we've got to reduce overtime the overall wholesale and corporate debt
levels. You saw us extinguish $500 million of debt in our tender that we did in Q4. I think it's just kind of the
opportunity to continue to leverage more core deposits to fund the company frankly over the course of this year.
This question of elevated liquidity and how long it will stay is sort of the $64,000 question, but we're fairly
convinced it's going to stay for a while and it will likely go up frankly in the near term given some of the new things
that are coming through. So there's a real opportunity there. And behind the scenes, our account acquisition are
deepening and deposit gathering on a core basis is accelerating as well. So I think as we get through this year
that will just continue to be an opportunity well out into 2022 and beyond.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I like to start on the expense side. Looking at the 3% to 5% guidance for 2021, it's a bit above 2020. Steve, you
said you plan to lean in and position the company better for an economic recovery. Can you give more color, is
this an investment in more people, systems, customer-friendly products, like give us some sense of what you're
investing in here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Absolutely. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks – this is Zach, as I mentioned in my remarks and I would like
to stress again, essentially the entirety of that growth, driven by our investments and our strategic plan, and you
could think about just three broad categories. It's approximately 60% technology development, around 20%
marketing and around 20% select personal ads that are tied to our strategic growth initiatives. So it really is all
about investment.
In the tech side, we're just continuing to lean in on digital. And as I mentioned in my remarks, digital or
development roadmap across every one of our business – major business lines to drive product origination,
account deepening and sort of ease of use and servicing efficiencies and personalization and optimization across
each product lines. And we're incredibly bullish about that. The investments themselves, the expenses are going
to be front-end loaded during the year. So we'll see substantially higher levels of growth in the first half of the year
and then ramping down pretty significantly in the back half of the year such that by the kind of run rate expense
growth will be lower than the growth rate of revenue in the second half. But just to summarize, we really feel now
is exactly the right time to make these investments and we're already starting to see some of the returns from
them. So feel good about it and that's the trajectory and composition of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. For my follow-up question, so your commentary on loan pipeline, the customer sentiment is
favorable. But my question is given this enormous buildup of deposits, right, the whole industry is seeing, when
you look at your middle market customers, are they sitting on a ton of cash, which might delay their appetite to
actually draw on lines? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It's almost a tale of two worlds, Steve. In that regard, we have many customers that are very liquid. You see it in
commercial line utilizations with us and the industry as a whole. There are some, however, that are either
significantly investing, rebuilding inventory or frankly have not had the fundamental performance, for whatever
reasons, it could be COVID related. They just didn't have a good year. I do think the stimulus will – that was – that

has been provided plus the proposed one if it's inactive will further delay sort of the rebound to the norm in terms
of line utilizations, but that will be a big tailwind for us and others eventually. We do see supply chain disruption
also impacting utilization. It's very clearly happening in the dealer floor plan side, for example, notwithstanding it
improved a bit in the fourth quarter. It's not where – it's not normalized and it will probably several quarters before
it becomes normalized.
So all of that is to say that there's this tailwind building for the industry and we may see it in the second half of this
year, which is I think consistent with how many banks are expressing both GDP growth and optimism as well as
the potential for utilization that there will – there's a lot of investment activity that's going on and they're using their
cash, but at some point that will revert to a more traditional level of external financing, bank financing as well. So
we're moving market share a bit with the growth that we're achieving through the fourth quarter and projecting and
we're optimistic given the pipelines. We'll continue to do that, but at some point we'll have a substantial tailwind as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And your plan to lean in on the investment is pretty heavy early in the year and capture more of that in the
back half.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
It is and as Zach said, particularly on the digital side. If you think about how consumers and businesses are being
trained via Apple or Amazon in terms of digital usage, availability, ease of capacity to accelerate transactional
activity, all of that is going to impact our industry and therefore we've accelerated our existing digital plan
substantially to try and continue to get, stay in front, get in front and maintain that J.D. Power leading position that
we've had for a couple of years.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
A follow-up question. Good morning. A follow-up question on the net interest income guide, appreciate the color
on reallocating $2 billion of cash in the first quarter. As we think about average deposits up 5% to 7% against
loans up 2% to 4%, Zach, I'm wondering what you were assuming for liquidity build in your outlook for net interest
income flat for the rest of the year and are you contemplating any growth from PPP 2.0 as well as forgiveness
income from PPP 2.0 in your guide.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Erika. Great question. I mentioned in one of my previous comments that it is sort of the $64,000
question frankly in terms of how long the elevated deposits will last. But, generally, what we're expecting is a
relatively flat trend in our deposits at the Fed for the first half of the year, to give you a sense, in Q4, was around
$5 billion. We expect to sort of maintain that rough level through the first half of the year. And then kind of absent
the new stimulus and absent the new PPP, our operating outlook had been for sort of a gradual reduction in that
toward the back half of the year, but not that substantial, maybe down to 3% by the end of the year in terms of $1
billion.
I think the – with that being said, we'll see about any new stimulus coming through on the fiscal side and likely if
that does happen we'll see that be elevated even more and could, as I mentioned, given opportunity to invest
more in securities. And likewise, PPP, the next round of PPP is just now kicking off. We're not sure exactly where
it's going to land. We'll see. For my guidance, I've assumed around a $1 billion. But I'm hopeful and it's quite likely
to be potentially up to double that we'll see. In terms of the PPP forgiveness at the first round, I think I mentioned
in the prepared comments, but just to restate it for clarity, we're assuming 85% of the $6 billion that we had on
sheet in Q4 to be forgiven in the first half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. I'll follow up on the modeling call on the forgiveness for PPP 2.0. My second question is more for Steve. 35
to 55 basis points is quite an accomplishment for the kind of economic downturn we have experienced. And I'm
wondering do you think that the government has been successful at redefining what the cycle peak is for this
downturn in that the 35 to 55 basis points represents the peak in losses that we'll see during this cycle or do you
think they've just delayed it to 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Erica, I don't believe the losses are materially delayed in our case. I can't answer for other institutions. But it
seems to me that the proactive efforts by both the Federal Reserve and the fiscal multiple rounds of fiscal
stimulus that substantial losses have been likely avoided as support has been delivered to consumers and small
business and the interest rate levels at historic lows have helped businesses generally. So I think history will show
these very strong actions have mitigated what otherwise could have been a very ugly period in our economic
history.
If we think back to the second quarter and the free fall in GDP to be able, to substantially reverse that in just a
couple quarters is remarkable, unlike anything we've seen in our history. And I think that flows then through the
system with lower accumulated losses over time. I think we've been conservative, maybe very conservative in our
loss recognition thus far, but we've tried to maintain that to that posture as you saw with how we approach

provision in fourth quarter just to let this season and get to a high level of confidence before we do things with
lowering reserves in total or things like that. But I'm very optimistic and confident that we have our losses peaked
in 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. And Mark is going to kill me, but I have to squeeze in this third question. And Steve this is for you. It
feels like the – this is more a testing of a thesis, but expenses up 3% to 5%. It seems like you're very much
looking forward and saying, look, this is a year where we may likely have significant reserve release if the
economic outlook pans out. And the Street's not going to give us much credit for that earnings anyway, why not
pull forward the expenses and have a great first full year in 2022 for both as a standalone company and as a
combined company? Any thoughts there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, that is not the intended approach. Remember, we have to call the reserves as we see them. We have
multiple economic scenarios and a peak second round. I hope a peak second round of the virus as of year-end.
Now that is a possible scenario, but that's not a planned scenario [ph] on par 00:51:49).
Revert to what Zach said a minute ago, the core expenses are virtually flat in 2021 versus 2020. The increases
are discretionary investment decisions made as a consequence of the strategic planning and the posture we want
to take principally around digital technology. So we believe we have a momentum in the business. We're one of
the few banks that talked about commercial loan growth and our pipeline year-over-year is better in a COVID
environment than it was in a pre-COVID environment.
So like what we've been able to build, operating a company through this very challenging period of time in terms
of momentum and focus and execution and we're going to continue to play that against the backdrop of consumer
and business demands changing radically as a consequence of digital and the need for digital throughout the
pandemic. And again, I think usage is being defined by others, by Amazon and Apple and others, and so those
expectations are I believe going to be a reality for our industry and certainly our company and we're going to
invest to meet those if not get ahead of them.

Thanks. Hey, good morning, everyone. One follow-up on the NII side, Zach; just wondering if you can parse it.
Just if you just think about the all-in PPP 2020 that was in the NII versus 2021 vis-à-vis how you're talking about
overall NII for the year if there's a way you can help us understand that? Thanks.

Zachary J. Wasserman A

4 basis points of benefit on a full-year basis in the NIM from the PPP program in 2021 to give you a sense.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. So a little bit higher. Makes sense. Okay. And then the second question is on the consumer loan
side, you're talking about really good growth there, again mid-single digit growth. But auto has been flat for
several quarters now. You've grown in some of the other categories. Just wondering specifically to auto just how
you're feeling about growing that book going ahead. And then if that's expected to stay flat, where would you
expect to see the rest of growth coming from on the consumer side? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The auto industry was like a $16 million, $16.2 million production in 2020 and the outlook is closer to $17 million
going forward for 2021. So that will be part of it. There's also a market share component that will be – I think just
because of our consistency and track record, it will continue to move and yet maintain the spreads that we're
looking for as well as credit quality. We are also opening up or planning to open up in a few additional states in
2021. That will also supplement our production. So we're confident. Our team has been outstanding in this area
for many, many years. We're confident in our ability to execute that. We also – I think we're number five or six
nationally in terms of home equity originations. So it's not just mortgage, so we're not dependent wholly on
mortgage refi. We've a lot of broad-based home lending capabilities and investments in technology in that area as
well, which will continue to drive more volume. We have a substantial implementation of blend for example that
has been ramped up very quickly and will be an important chain – a very important app for us as we go forward. I
think we're taking about 10 days off at the close as a result of using that as an example.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hello, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. You gave some guidance that mortgage banking is going to be challenging, which is good for all
banks. Just wondering if you'd give a little bit more color how you're thinking about mortgage banking off the
fourth quarter level, if you could give a little bit more guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. Absolutely. This is Zach. I'll take that one. So mortgage banking had kept coming off and it's just an
incredible year in 2020. To give you a sense of the industry, mortgage making association is forecasting volumes
in 2020 down about 23% with a shift toward purchase not surprisingly with revised being very substantially lower.
Our vault – we've actually been gaining share on app volumes over the last several years and we expect to
continue to do so. So our general expectation for app volume is sort of down in the 10% to 15% range relative to
that 20% or more down at an industry level. I think one of things we're watching pretty closely is also the salable
spread and where that trends. We've frankly budgeted pretty conservatively on that assuming a relatively
continual trend back to more historical levels by the end of the year. We'll see. So far, they're actually holding up
fairly solid in the first days of Q1 and we'll see that those are volatile as you know, but generally we budgeted
fairly conservatively. So I think mortgage banking income going to be down year on year. And so as I said – as I
mentioned, really leaning into the other fee income lines that are growing smartly to offset that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And if I can ask about the TCF acquisition, I'm just wondering, obviously you haven't closed the
deal, but any way you can quantify maybe a range for potential revenue synergies? I know it's not part of your
guidance. And then secondly, what would you say the top three revenue opportunities with this deal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Peter, I'll take that and let me start. I think I was a bit brusque with an answer to a question you had last time, so
with apologies for that. But picking up on TCF, we haven't talked a lot about revenue synergies, but they are
clearly there. We have a much broader product than on both the consumer and business side. So the capacity to
cross-sell and deepen much like we saw with FirstMerit is very substantial and it's hard to take that in and
certainly not something you guys want to hear. So we haven't front run that with you, but with them is definitely a
case.
We've been very impressed with the quality of the teams that we've seen in a variety of the areas in TCF, both
business line and technology and some of support areas, for example. And so I think we will be a stronger
company by the blend as well and that will have upside. Then finally, they do some things extraordinarily well.

Their equipment finance business terms or finance business, these are little jabs and they're not widely known or
appreciated, but we really like what we saw in diligence and have learned subsequently, and those are just a few
of the businesses and opportunities.
There's a substantial outsourcing as well both on the capital market side for most products and again it's a much
more limited venue than we offer as well as their broker dealer, their credit card, it's a variety of businesses that
will bring back in fairly quickly as we move forward. So there's the 40% expense and we just articulated a 43%
branch consolidation, so you can see where that's coming from.
It'll be their systems to ours 100%, so we've got a lot of early on very, very good work that's getting us bullish on
the expense side, but the play here is a revenue play, new markets – exciting new markets. Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Denver, Colorado Springs, more than tripling us in Chicago, opening in Milwaukee and Silicon Valley, I mean
there's a lot to go for plus the scale change in Michigan will be a one or two and virtually everything in Michigan,
so we really like the revenue side of this and you'll see that reflected in 2022 and beyond as we get set.

Thank you. Good morning. Hey, guys. I had a follow-up question on autos, specifically slide 44. Your mix of new
originations increased to 54% this quarter. Can you speak to the notion that new vehicle financing is an area
where the captives have a greater edge over indirect lenders because their primary goal is helping their OEMs
move steel, so they're willing to compromise a bit more on pricing? Does that have a – I guess is having a greater
share of new vehicle origination suggest that you guys are getting lower margins than you would if you had a
larger mix of used? If you could just kind of comment on the profitability of used versus new vehicle financing, that
would be helpful.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Bill, this is typical seasonality of new model introduction and so as we look back, we'd see essentially the same
ratios year-over-year, albeit this year a bit constrained by just inventory. So you're right, the OEMs will [ph] sort of
vet (01:02:07) that and that's why we tend to have slightly more used than new as a sort of a normalized run rate.
As you know, we've been very, very disciplined for many, many years in this area and so the performance of the
book has been very consistent and would expect that to continue to be. So it's our best-performing asset class
year in, year out on DFAST as an example. So we really like our positioning with the product with the dealers. The
consistency and speed at which we offer, we think we've got a best-in-class capability, was clearly one of our
most seasoned teams in the bank managing this area. And so I don't see a big change going on. There are times
when the OEMs will submit more to try and drive more volume and history will tell us these things come in waves.

That's very helpful, Steve. I'm sorry if I missed this, but wanted to follow up on you made a comment in your
prepared remarks around dealer floor plan levels and how it will take longer for balances to return back to
historical levels. Does that presume that dealers will be running with less inventory than they have historically in
sort of kind of a new normal post-COVID environment or do you think that we'll see like a reversion to historical
inventory levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We expect a reversion to the norm. It's a supply chain issue at this point. For example, you would have seen all
this manufacturing interrupted by just a chip last week in terms of production. So this will come back we believe
probably at this point by the – in the second half as opposed to earlier. And some of the imports in particular are
feeling constrained on the supply side. You're going to see more and more manufacturing come back into the US
or pick up on Mexico, Canada as a result of wanting to narrow the supply chain lines, a consequence of what's
happened over the last year. And that's a benefit to us.

Thanks for letting me come in here at the end of the queue. But what – couple of cleanups, RV, marine, you had
some pretty strong growth and maybe some of that is COVID-related last year. Do you expect the mean reversion
there? What are you thinking about in terms of growth potential there and just longer term thinking about asset
value there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The industry outlook on that, Jon, is for a continued high purchase levels for the next couple of years and we're
positioned for that very, very well. As you know, that's an 800 FICO for us, so we worry a bit about oversupply in
the intermediate term, but the positioning of our book I think will very, very substantially mitigate what could be a
22

three or five years of bit of access. So I think we've played it – we are playing it very, very well and we'll have
consistency of performance with 800-plus average FICO for the foreseeable future. And I think that's what you
were getting to. These supply-demand potential imbalances would come back out of COVID, but that could exist.
Right now, there's virtually very little on bringing lots as of the end of the third quarter. It's building again, but
demand could outstrip supply as it did in 2020 and to a certain extent that happened with RV as well, so I think
there's a very good couple of years and where we're playing I believe is very safe for the long term and profitable.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good, okay. And Richard, question for you. Your guidance is great, but the one thing we're all trying to plug in is
the provision and reserve level. And so I wanted to go back one more time to this. You used the term snap a
chalk line in December, which I think I've never heard on the call before, but it's excellent. You talked about using
the November base case. You look at December and January, it was different. You use Moody's, it's clearly
better. You talked about in your qualitative, you're waiting for stimulus. That's a little bit uncertain. Is it as simple
as if we get the stimulus and this January Moody's holds we get some improvement in February? The reserves
just have to come down, don't they? Is that the right way to look at it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I would say absolutely the reserves have to come down. It's just a question of the timing and where they
come down to. We started the – the CECL day one was 170 and we're up to 229. I would imagine at some point
we're going to get back to the neighborhood of the 170 where we started. But I would say that we're also not
targeting a specific time to get there. I think as I pointed out, we're going to be prudent on – we were conservative
on the way up and we'll be prudent on the way down to make sure that we're not kind of whipsawing the provision
on a quarter-by-quarter basis, overreacting to one data point along the way. I think it's we sit here and run a very
disciplined process every quarter looking at not only the quantitative pieces of it, but the more qualitative pieces
and when we feel that those are aligning and our credit quality continues to hold, which we expect that it will, we'll
bring the reserve down. And I would say that that is more likely to happen in the back half of the year than first
quarter certainly.
