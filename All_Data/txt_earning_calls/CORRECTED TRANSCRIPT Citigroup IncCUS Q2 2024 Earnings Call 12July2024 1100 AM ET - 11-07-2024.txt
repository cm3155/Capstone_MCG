Jennifer Landis
Head-Investor Relations, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am
joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may
contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to
uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a
variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results for the quarter, let me first address
the regulatory action by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which were
announced on Wednesday.
These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020 and those orders covered
four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls and compliance. Addressing these areas is the
primary goal of our transformation, our number one priority. It is a multiyear effort to modernize our infrastructure,
unify disparate tech platforms and automate processes and controls.
This week's actions focus primarily on data quality management. We've been public this year about the fact that
we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory
actions consisted of two civil money penalties and under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new
process designed to ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones and that is
called the Resource Review Plan.
We are currently developing the plan for submission to the OCC. Now, by way of background, while the Federal
Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is the primary regulator for
Citibank NA, we call it CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets.
The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA to continue paying to Citigroup at a minimum the
dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations. While we're
3

developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review Plan, dividend amounts above that would require
the OCC's non-objection.
Now, these dividends are inter-company payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent, Citigroup.
They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays through its shareholders. Indeed, there is
no restriction on Citigroup's ability to pay common dividends to shareholders nor is there a restriction to buying
back shares.
And let me be very clear. Even with the investments needed for our transformation, Citigroup has more than
sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders.
We will increase our dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 a share as we announced in late June, and we will resume
modest buybacks this quarter.
While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our
people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we're confident in our ability to get these specific areas
where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation, and we are pleased that
it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and
simplifying our firm.
A multiyear undertaking such as this was never going to be linear, but I can assure you, the investments we have
been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve control and deliver very tangible outcomes.
The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans,
automated controls for our traders to reduce errors, moved risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure, and
increased the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime.
The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial
constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital
needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan,
Tim Ryan, and Andy Sieg. You have my and the entire management's team commitment that we will address any
area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will
get this work where it needs to be, as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our
organization.
Now, turning to what was another good quarter. Our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our
strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return target. We reported net income of $3.2 billion,
with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall as well as up in each
of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage.
Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we're taking to simplify our organization, right-size
businesses such as Markets and Wealth and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold, even as we
increase investment in our transformation. Over the medium term, we expect these simplification and stranded
cost actions to drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in annual run rate saves.
Services grew 3%, driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross-
border payments and in commercial cards. Securities Services was up 10% with new client onboarding,
deepening with existing clients and market valuations, helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary
9%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in depth about how
we're going to continue to grow this high-returning business and we're very pleased that people are starting to
recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel.
Overall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter, leading to better performance than we'd anticipated. Fixed
Income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX than rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth
and financing and securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, driven by
strong performance in derivatives, which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer.
Banking was up 38% as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients
continued to access debt capital markets with investment grade issuance near-record levels. Equity issuance
increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment
Banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year, and we've seen some healthy volumes associated with
announced deals year-to-date, particularly in Natural Resources and Technology.
Combined with the strong pipeline, Advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year and
into next year. Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment
revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also
starting to pay off, with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continued to attract top talent from the industry, as
they focus on our Investments business and on enhancing the client experience.
U.S. Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6%, with all three businesses again contributing to the top line.
There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both Branded Cards and Retail Services, and we continue
to see differentiation in the Credit segment, with the lower income customers seeing pressure.
Retail Banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering strong
referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the
combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly expect USPB's returns to
improve from here.
The recent stress test again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6%,
and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, given the reduction of our
Stress Capital Buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53.
During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders, and we are increasing our
dividend by 6%. We expect to buy back $1 billion in common shares this quarter, and we will continue to assess
the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III Endgame.
Looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year, the US is still the world's most
structurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory.
Services spending has remained on an upward trend, although there were clear signs of a softening labor market
and the tightening of the consumer budget. And of course, you might have heard there is an election in
November.
In Europe, while rate cuts have begun, the region's lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth. In
Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is
being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semiconductors. Despite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
Investor Day when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce
good results in a wide variety of macro environments, and there is plenty of upside for us across our five
businesses.
We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification, both strategically and organizationally. We've
completed most of the exits of our international consumer market. We streamlined our organization to capitalize
agility and faster decision-making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service, and we are
automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our
transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and then continue to further improve
our returns over time.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-
over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on
the business.
On slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately
$3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52, and RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by
growth across all businesses, as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A
significant portion of this gain is reflected in Equity Markets, with the remainder reflected in All Other. Expenses
were $13.4 billion, down 2%, and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination of revenue growth and expense
decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm in the majority of our businesses.
Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL
releases in all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly
$22 billion of total reserves, with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%.
On slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.4
billion, down 2% and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed
and OCC earlier this week. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our
organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction, and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued
investment in transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalty. As we said over the past few months, we will
continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control
infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our saves and head count reduction going forward.
However, based on what we know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range,
excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalty. With that said, we will, of course, continue to
look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties.
Before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter, I'd like to also give more color on the
transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We made good progress on our
transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before
discussing the announcement.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
First, wholesale credit and loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end-to-end operating model and
consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology. This has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating
efficiency and the client experience. We've also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our
risk assessment and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in data, while there's a lot
more to do, we stood up a data governance process and streamline our data architecture to ultimately facilitate
straight-through processing. Overall, we've improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems
and platforms to improve our resiliency.
These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we're making progress against our transformation
milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management, particularly related to regulatory
reporting, which we've acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we've begun to put
additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory
reporting and data governance, but also stress testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution/Recovery.
We also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we are focused on data that impacts these reports first. We take this
feedback from our regulators very seriously, and we're committed to allocating all the resources necessary to
meet their expectations.
Now turning back to the quarterly results. On slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I'll
speak to sequential variance. In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding Markets, net
interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, seasonally lower
revolving card balances, and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth.
Average loans were roughly flat, as growth in Cards and Mexico Consumer was largely offset by slight declines
across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to
investments in Wealth, as well as non-operational outflows in TTS.
On slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite
framework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores
of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a
divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income band.
When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at
the beginning of 2019, and it is the over 740 FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and
maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and
borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates.
That said, as we will discuss later, we're seeing signs of stabilization and delinquency performance across our
Cards portfolio, and we've taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain well-reserved with a reserve-
to-funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio.
Our corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and approximately 82% as of the second quarter and we saw a
nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven by upgrades and
repayment.
Additionally, this quarter, we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions, driven by HPI, oil prices and equity
market valuations and our credit loss reserves continued to incorporate a scenario-weighted average
unemployment rate of nearly 5% and a downside unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very
comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment.

Turning to slide 11. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity. It
is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our balance sheet is
a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-
diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate at
$807 billion and span 90 countries.
And as you heard at the Services Investor Day, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are
crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature, and
therefore, very stable.
The majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion, are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold,
Retail and Wealth at Work offerings as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US
dollar-denominated, with the remainder spanning over 60 currency. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk
appetite framework.
Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans and about one-third of our
balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality short duration investment securities that contribute to our
approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources.
We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities,
which position us to be a source of strength for the industry, and importantly, for our clients.
On slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We
ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points or approximately
$15 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our regulatory capital
requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, which incorporates the reduction in our Stress Capital Buffer
from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple of weeks ago.
We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That
said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the
benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital
requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per
share to $0.56 per share following the SCB results, and as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of
buybacks this quarter.
So now turning to slide 13, before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, we
implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services and Markets, to
reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is
included in the All Other line for each business in our financial supplement.
In Services, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and
Securities Services. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in
Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher US and non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year period.
Non-interest revenue increased 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a
smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our
continued investment in product innovation, client experience, and platform modernization that we highlighted
during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related
8

transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and
technology.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter. Average loans were up 3%,
primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working
capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1%,
driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows.
Net income was approximately $1.5 billion, and Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE, coming in at 23.8%
for the quarter.
On slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Markets revenues were up 6%. Fixed Income
revenues decreased 3%, driven by rates and currencies which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and
tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up
20%, primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees.
In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continued to see good underlying momentum in Equity,
primarily driven by equity derivative and we continued to make progress in prime, with balances up approximately
18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Average loans
increased 11%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products. Average trading assets increased
12%, largely driven by client demand for treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive
operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion, with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the
quarter.
On slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven by
growth in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues increased 60%, driven by
strength across Capital Markets and Advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued to benefit from
strong issuance activities, mainly in investment grade, as issuers continued to de-risk funding plans in advance of
what could be a more volatile second half and the context of a number of important global elections as well as the
macro environment.
In ECM, excluding China A shares, we're seeing a pickup in IPO activity, led by the US as well as continued
convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to
be higher for longer. And in Advisory, we're seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023,
coming to fruition as those transactions close.
Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM and Advisory, particularly in
Technology, where we've been investing. Corporate Lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan
hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again
this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right-size the expense base.
Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release, reflecting an improvement in the
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit loss. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintained strict
discipline around returns, combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million and
RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
On slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by a
13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher
mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from
double-digit client investment asset growth both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client
investment assets as well as market valuation.
Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we right-sized the workforce and
expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million, as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss.
Preliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as
higher deposits.
Average loans were flat as we continued to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely
reflecting transfer of relationships and associated deposit from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to
higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform.
Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new investment assets flows, and the benefit of higher
market valuation. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter and delivered net income of $210
million, with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter.
On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues
increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payment. Branded Cards revenues increased 8%,
driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate, and we continue to see
growth in spend volumes of 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher.
Retail Services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners, due to
higher net credit losses and interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail Banking revenues increased 3%, driven by
higher deposit spreads as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating
leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially
offset by higher volume-related expenses.
Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion, and an ACL build of
approximately $400 million, reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things
driving our NCLs this quarter: First, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all
maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of
government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third,
certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates, resulting in
higher losses. However, across both portfolios, we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance,
but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses.
Despite these factors, we still expect Branded Cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year and
Retail Services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18% as the
transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying
growth. Net income was $121 million and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%.
As we said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwind, lap the credit
cycle, and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business, to ultimately get to a
high teens return over the medium term.

On slide 18, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy
Franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exits
and wind-downs and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico, as well as the impact from the Visa
B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs.
Slide 19 shows our full-year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We
continue to remain laser-focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business' performance.
And while we recognize there's a lot more to do on transformation, we're pleased with the progress that we're
making towards our 2024 and medium-term targets and remain committed to these targets.
With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line
is now open. Please go ahead.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order, Jane? You said it was disappointing to have gotten
that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved and what's
on – that's the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean, you have what 12,000
people thrown at the problem. Billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Is it not enough money? Do you need to
look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language?
I mean, you had John Dugan as your lead independent director, ex sort of the OCC, and it seems like you got
your report card. I guess you passed overall. They went out of their way to say some nice things, but it looks like
you got failing grades in data and regulatory management. So, you're confident it's going to be resolved, but it's
already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So what is it going to take from here and how can you
resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then in the win column,
since it's so nebulous this back office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but if you could put
more meat on those bones. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts to that, so let's start by just taking a step back. Our
transformation is addressing decades of under-investment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and
control environment. And when you unpack that – those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-
wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of
groups were allowed to solve problem – the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual
processes and controls, and a weak first line of defense, too few subject matter experts.
So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old Citi putting in Band-
Aids. This is Citi tackling the root issues head on. It's a multiyear undertaking as we've talked about and you saw
the statement by one of our regulators this week; we have made meaningful progress on our transformation and
on our simplification.

Mark, do you want to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, and so as Jane says, the progress that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and
transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it
includes compliance, it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting, and we've got evidence and
proof points of progress against all of those things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Mark. So transforming, to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the
same time. Transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not
mutually exclusive.
At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business
performance. Awe're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focus strategy,
we've executed the divestitures, we've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities,
and we are able to do both.
You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy. And
we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy
and we're executing against them. We have been, and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we

Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike, you've heard us mention some of these before, but
we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved
from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to
one, we've reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one, 11 sanction platforms down to one. So, we've been
making considerable progress over the past couple of years.
With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about
Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right. So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into
those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently,
that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information. And so this is an end-to-end process in the
way we're approaching it.
One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data. And that data is, it's important
again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that it's
of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year. I'm talking the US Private – Personal
Banking. I heard your comments for credit the rest of this year, and I think in a position that you're very
conservatively reserved. But right now, you put up a 3% margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues
are in this space.
I guess my question is this, as we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower – some rate cuts,
how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because – can we be expecting credit costs to come
in in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward, because it could be impactful if USPB
obviously marches to where you need it to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the
medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You've got to remember that when you look at the quarter and
you look at the half, frankly, that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit.
And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now
maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L. That's not just true for us. That's true for others as well.
And so, we'd expect, and we are – we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at
delinquencies now. And so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come
down as we go towards the medium term.
At the same time, we're investing in the business, and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the
top line. And the combination of those things, as we drive towards the medium term, will help us to deliver both
the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what we've guided to.
So it's a combination of top line performance from volume, and obviously the environment plays into that, but we
feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued
discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Appreciate all that. One quickie on DCM, you had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of
conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three quarters of the activity. Could you just help
us think through the second half when thinking about DCM, just to make sure that we don't like start [indiscernible]
(00:44:23) into perpetuity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, I think when we think about the back half of 2024, we're going to see a different mix of activity in banking.
We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products, because you've got a wall of
maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But we did see some
clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
So if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be
accommodative, as well as to continue deal making, with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some
of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple things: so,
one, the return of a more normalized IPO market; two, the direction and volatility of interest rates; the ongoing
global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing; and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks,
the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US but abroad. And so there are a number of
factors there that will play to the wallet. But as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our
clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.

Operator: The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Just, Mark, maybe on NII down almost 4% year-over-year, seems a little bit more than the
guidance was down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we
should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter, and you see it on slide 9, ex-Markets,
we're down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally
lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is, is in Argentina, we
have capital there. The policy rate was adjusted downward, and as that happened, we obviously earned less on
that capital that flows through the NII line.
As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts
and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right? So as I think about the higher yield that we can
earn on reinvestment, that will be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view.
The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio and we do expect to see continued
volume growth across certainly the branded portfolio and so that will be another tailwind for us on the NII line.
In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates that will continue to play
through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our
forecast the impact of CFPB late fees. So assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact
and it's in the forecast, and then the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of
those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again,
consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, kind of a similar question on expenses. Better than expected this quarter,
but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to
14


Citigroup, Inc.
(C) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate. Is that because you expect more repositioning, restructuring in
the second half, or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so that's right. When I talked about it the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of
the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the
guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in – will come in higher than the second
quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in
the transformation work that has to be done.
It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our
businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or – yeah, the second quarter did
have a one-time or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around
advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the second quarter – the third and fourth
quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.

Operator: The next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. I had two questions and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow-up to the previous. Mark,
just to clarify. Let's just, say, take the highest end of your range at $53.8 billion. Just trying to think about how
consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year-to-date
so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other
repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So, yes. The answer to the last part of your question is yes. So in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8
billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range
excludes the FDIC Special Assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is for Jane and I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So,
you're buying back $1 billion – you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in
the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1
billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is
the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully
appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for
Basel clarification. But I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel
comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the
beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.

Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue
to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty
about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our Stress Capital
Buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of
our strategy playing out. But with the regulatory changes uncertain, that's one of the major factors for us to
continue with the quarterly guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. And on the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our
regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2. So, Q3, as we talked about,
would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take
it quarter by quarter from here.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can
you also talk about, if this was a factor at all for you folks, was there any FICO score inflation back during the
pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you
mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored in, the lower fees – you factored that into your forward-look.
Where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, so, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past, the prospect of FICO
inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've
made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of
new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher
FICO scores for new account acquisitions.
But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher
FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and
savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers, where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and
16

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
more borrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and
dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point.
In terms of the CFPB late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in our
forecast. But in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.

Operator: The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Mark. Talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of
a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer and then the beginnings of some of the non-US
curve starting to, at least put fourth their first cut. I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about
the relative contributions. Can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking
through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as
you go forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it, out through the – certainly through the medium term, we
expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically
and that's in large part because or in part I should say because of how we've been managing the balance sheet
and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to
what we were earning, in some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so we
still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view.
The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that'll play through a little bit as
we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have
higher betas pick up outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see
kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of
volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term, the higher yield we can
earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of
that beta, we believe we'll have continued NII growth.
As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to
the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously, cross currencies. And in
that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion
coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time
and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment
higher yields that we'd be able to earn.

So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that. It's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources
allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order. Essentially if an area is delayed or
looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track and
then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty
constantly ourselves.
We're already working on the plan. After it's finalized with the OCC [ph] so (01:00:17), it will be confidential
supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is – what the nature of
the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to
get it – we're not expecting this to take long.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on
how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term, as we have come quite a
long way in the simplification process. Maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification
impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we
skewed a little bit more towards requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So, thank you, Betsy. I guess I'd say a couple things. So, I think we said it in the past. So, the target for the
medium term, we think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have
about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion
related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that
medium-term period.
18


Citigroup, Inc.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned, in the org simplification and the
restructuring charges associated with that. Those saves will have started to generate. Some of those saves in the
early part of that, meaning this year, will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the
business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the
trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 in achieving that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium
term. And we've got the – we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today,
making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that, as
well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. So, we feel confident around that
and good about it, we can manage this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion
last year, a little bit under that, on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little
bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work
and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on, like data
and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right,
and we've done that and we funded that.
We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given
for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right, so not – the whole $53 billion plus of it, we
are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on
track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind and to shore up areas where we're tracking in accordance to
what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base?
And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding
efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in
parts of USPB and that we have continued to get after in parts of banking, which you see in the down 10% this
quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there
inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, longwinded way of saying, we
understand the expense guidance that we've given, we also understand and stress the importance of funding the
transformation with what's required and we're doing both.

Hi. Let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 billion to $53.8
billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan,
meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order. Am I right there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
No, you're not right. So, I think as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now, that we knew the areas that
we were behind in our elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making
the investments. Some of that's in people. Some of that is in technology spend. It's using different tools and
capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged
as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind.
Mark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
That's right, Jane, and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more,
we're not changing the guidance, right. And so, we have, as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already
that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators,
we should not expect any change to this expense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, the plan, the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the
regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate
resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to
technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution.
If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those
areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay, and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to
get it back on track. And that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so
what we're saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come, that we haven't identified already, that's the
process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend
whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track. And as we've done thus far this year, we're going to
look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.

I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in
some of the – in the spend, as Mark had referred to, Matt. But – and a lot of the spending and the growth areas
we are seeing and the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward – across the portfolio of rewards playing through
from one quarter to the other, so the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A

But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the
dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company, because of
the OCC came out this week. For all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or
subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the
holding company, but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside? Thank you.

Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, let's be clear, this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that
are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parent. So, first of all, don't confuse what a
dividend is here. It's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital, the liquidity at all,
and the dividends are not capped.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Jane, that's right. And I think, let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there. And the
purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right.
So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right, and so that is the
primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced
there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan. But as Jane mentions, that does not constrain
the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to, it's not a cap. What it is is that anything
above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations would
require a non-objection from the OCC.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just – I guess I just want to follow up on the latter question. I
just want to be very clear. So, what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection
before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how
you think about – it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from,
for example, a Basel Endgame rule that softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of
simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to
repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Second question on, I just want to follow up on USPB. I mean, I still – I get the point that you're seeing a
normalization in losses in cards. But even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single-digits. I would
think even at these NCL levels, your cards business is pretty profitable. You're a scale player, you're above sort of
pre-pandemic levels, but not – I don't know if I – it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount.
It would seem to imply that the retail bank is a huge drag on profitability, even – maybe even losing money, I don't
know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the retail bank profitability and just give any
more color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen RoTCE you talked about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, let me kick off there, and let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get
us to the high-teens level over the medium term. And you've seen us generating healthy positive operating
leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth.
And as Mark said, we're at the low point of the credit cycle, and we knew this year, we would see the pressure on
returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates
approach steady-state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the
industry headwinds, as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the firm-wide medium-
term targets.
In the retail bank, we are continuing to focus on growing share in our fixed core markets and we're doing that
leveraging our physical and digital assets. It plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the
growth that we are looking at in our Wealth franchise. We are continuing to improve our operating efficiency,

being very disciplined in expense management, and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the
retail bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle. It's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said
in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.

Operator: The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs. The
deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good
news here, I suppose, is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over
the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so, wanted to better understand this, what's constraining
your ability to utilize those DTAs? And are there catalysts on the horizon that could help accelerate that utilization
beyond organic earnings generation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yes. Thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes
down to driving US income, right. And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but
driving higher income in the US. That allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the
quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term, but that is the major driver of that
utilization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
And we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the
US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy [ph] that this (01:18:58) is refreshing. Similarly, we see
opportunities from the Commercial Bank. We see it in Wealth. We see it in, obviously in US Personal Banking and
in Services. So, we're very – we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this, not just from the
financial side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you, both, for that color. Maybe just a quick follow-up just on the Retail Services business. We are seeing
some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to
win some new mandates. And was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set
and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from
some of your peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we
enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the
one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue
24

side of things. And it's a shift probably from some other ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined
the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space. But as Jane
mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an
appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up
retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works and the reserves you have to establish for these
partnerships, we're establishing full, lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up
splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about
expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make
good sense for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right return and being very
disciplined around that.

Operator: The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Sorry, just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing,
how much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year?
Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order. It's
risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance and it's around control. As we've said, we were
falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind.
We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting, so we added some more bodies of work
there and we're well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on
when we will complete the body of work for the consent order.
We have a – target states for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make
the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as
possible and we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than, what I would call, the old Citi
way, which is a series of Band-Aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue and that way, we are
delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic
solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
Operator: The final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please
go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear
you saying that if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade. It's really the data
and as it relates to the data, you're talking about 11,000 regulatory reports, some which had 750,000 lines of data.
Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in
terms of overall controls and resiliency. But I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the
regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, Mike, maybe I just – maybe I – you're asking a great and it's an important question, so maybe I try and
explain what – the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data
all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, as you
heard about at our Service Investor Day, access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect.
And we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a
millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only
be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems.
So – but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's
about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And as I've said, we're doing a strategic
overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure, so what are we doing?
We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We'll often talk about this
smart system, makes sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a
result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories. They're the golden sources, an in-
person data hub which you've heard me talk about a few times and they're a golden source now for all of the
downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And
what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place that
govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have
been historically.
Mark's been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full
suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past. And we're delivering all of this
through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows, so instead of being in
multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a – sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I
think it is important to understand what it is because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of
tactical fixes.
Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan
that we have in place. There's some more areas to address and we knew back when we did the plan and we've
also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this
work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned.
26

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 12-Jul-2024
So, what we're doing, we're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices and we're
using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much
quickly. We're also, to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader
deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side
are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers,
drive more efficiencies and hope at the end – the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the
firm. That is the data plan.
Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're
investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I've talked about, to get it done. We'll get it done.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, just to say real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short, just in like
one sentence, despite doing all of this great stuff that you described, the regulator still said you didn't get it done.
Why, after doing all that, didn't you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now? Just like
a one sentence explanation for that if you have it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jane Nind Fraser A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Citigroup, Inc.
I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps
forward. We have setbacks. We adjust, we learn from them, we move forward and we get back on track.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
And Mike, if I could just put one number into context because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of
global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are
pivotal to our US regulators and a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the
data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.
