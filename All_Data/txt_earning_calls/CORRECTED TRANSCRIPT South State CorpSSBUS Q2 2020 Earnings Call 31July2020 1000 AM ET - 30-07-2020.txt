Now, I will turn the call over to Robert Hill, Executive Chairman.

Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning and thanks for being with us today. Only 53 days into our merger and much has changed in the
world. What has not changed is the speed at which we are moving to integrate two strong companies, the
commitment of our team and our board to the success, and the opportunities that lie in front of us.
While the economic environment has its challenges, the prospects for South State are significant. South State
was built on the principles of soundness, profitability and growth [Technical Difficulty] (02:12) in great markets had
us well-positioned for the long term. While any quarter with a merger involved is more complex, our revenues
remain strong, our expense plan on track, and we're able to take a lot of risk off the table as we combine the two
loan portfolios.
While there are certainly industry headwinds that will persist in the near term, I believe these challenges also
present opportunities for stronger banks to prosper. While 53 days is a very short period of time, in many ways, it
feels like these teams have been together for years. Our team continues to rise to the occasion. We are open and
honest with each other, building trust, and excited to be together as one team and focused on the same set of
goals.
I will now turn the call over to John for more insight into our quarter.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thank you, Robert. Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us this morning. I hope you and your
families are remaining healthy and safe.
2020 has been a transformative year for the banking industry as a whole, and it's been particularly transformative
for South State. We announced our strategic merger vehicles with CenterState on January 27. At the time, we
saw an opportunity to build an executive team that can lead our company through the digital transformation over
the next decade. We also saw an opportunity to combine two of the Southeast premier deposit franchises in the
best growth markets in the country. Two months after the merger announcement, while we were actively pursuing
regulatory and shareholder approval, the economy shut down. Like others, we shifted to a work-from-home
environment and immediately focused on how we can assist our clients in a time of need.
The two most powerful levers we could pull was first to be as generous as possible in providing loan payment
deferrals for our borrowers, and then second, to inject as much cash flow stimulus as possible through the PPP
loan program. The $2.4 billion of PPP stimulus that South State provided represents about 10% of our $24 billion
loan portfolio. And the deferrals we offer represents about 17% of our loan portfolio. In retrospect, I'm confident
that we chose the right strategy to be as generous as possible with short-term cash flow relief.
By working nights, weekends, and the Easter holiday, our bankers delivered for our clients when they needed us
the most. And that loyalty will pay dividends for years to come. While only about half of the 90-day loan payment
deferrals have matured through July, it's encouraging that the request for a second deferral is significantly lower
than the first round and less than we originally expected. Despite the distractions from COVID, we were able to

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
obtain regulatory and shareholder approval for the merger ahead of schedule and we made the decision to close
the transaction on June 7, which was earlier than planned.
Our mid-quarter close is messier from a financial perspective, but we wanted to put the closing in a rearview
mirror, so that we can move forward with the integration and so we can focus on our clients.
I would be remiss if I did not pause to recognize and thank our South State leadership team and bankers. Closing
a merger of equals in a stable environment is a very tall order. Doing it during a pandemic is heroic. From the
finance and legal team that closed the books in the middle of the quarter right after they completed $200 million
sub-debt offering. Through our relationship managers and support teams that process nearly 20,000 PPP loans,
the work ethic and professionalism of the South State bankers gives me tremendous confidence in the power of
this team. And I'm proud to be on the journey with them.
Will is going to walk through our combined second quarter results, but I want to offer my own high level
observations. Most importantly, the underlying earnings power of the company is steady and strong. To
demonstrate the steadiness of the combined company, we produced a slide on page 7 of the earnings deck,
which illustrates the PPNR trend, assuming that CenterState and South State were combined over the last year.
You can see that the PPNR for the second quarter would have been $157 million, which is consistent with prior
quarters and actually, it's slightly better than the same quarter last year.
With the merger closing in the second quarter, however, there were two highly unusual accounting issues, even
for those of us that are familiar with merger accounting. The first is that with the closing on June 7, the first 68
days of CenterState's earnings in the second quarter are not included in the second quarter of South State
earnings. The missing CenterState earnings for the first 68 days of the quarter would have added $75 million of
pre-provision net revenue to South State if the merger had occurred on April 1.
The second highly unusual item is the $119 million CECL reserve applied to the CenterState acquired loan
portfolio. This is a result of the new CECL accounting standard that is affectionately known as the double count,
whereby an acquired loan portfolio not only receives a traditional mark, but also simultaneously receives the loan
loss provision that runs through the income statement in the quarter that the merger closes.
Now, look, I'm not an accountant, but it seems to me personally like a belt-and-suspenders approach to loan loss
reserves. The silver lining is that this new accounting approach gives the company a very strong loss absorption
capacity. And I know [ph] this isn't (08:16) GAAP accounting. But if you add the acquired loan portfolio marks
together with the allowance, it's as if you have a combined loan loss reserve at 2.66%, which is substantially
higher than our peers. With these two unusual accounting items in the quarter, plus the normal merger-related
expenses, the company recorded a net loss of $1.96 per share on a GAAP basis.
Now, let me take you back to the normalized view of the quarter as if South State and CenterState had always
been combined. The combined company produced record revenue, driven by mortgage, correspondent banking
and capital market fees. These fee-based businesses really shine in this type of economic environment. And
we've been very intentional over the years to build a balanced business model.
Through the last five years, we've built successful fee income businesses that performed well with net interest
margins decline in addition to the normal balance sheet businesses that perform well when net interest margins
rise. This balanced business model is performing exactly as planned. Both mortgage and correspondent banking
enjoyed record revenues and record profitability this quarter even as the NIM came under pressure.

Loan growth was down slightly if you exclude the $2.3 billion of PPP loans. And asset quality metrics improved
across the board with lower past dues, non-accruals, and virtually no net charge-offs. Deposit growth boomed
during the quarter and the combined balance sheet expanded by more than $4 billion. Now clearly, most of that
growth was related to the PPP proceeds and short-term government stimulus. So we anticipate that the balance
sheet will shrink over time as the stimulus wears off.
And finally, capital. By combining the elevated CECL reserves with the purchase accounting marks, plus the $200
million of sub-debt that we raised in the second quarter, plus a strong and steady PPNR that will get even
stronger after we complete the merger cost saves, we feel that South State is well-positioned to move forward
despite the headwinds that the industry will experience over the next year.
Will, I'll turn it over to you.

William E. Matthews
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Thanks, John. This was clearly an important quarter for the company with the closing of the merger of equals.
Additionally, the size of this merger and the impact of CECL merger accounting created a lot of moving parts.
When we announced the MOE in late January, we had not expected to be the first MOE of size to receive
regulatory approvals and close in 2020 but we are, and we're also the first one post-CECL and post-pandemic
outbreak. So we're going to attempt to give you information you'll find meaningful amidst all the accounting noise
associated with the merger closing.
I want to start by recognizing and thanking our excellent finance team at South State as well as the credit and
CECL teams. Our mid-month closing and the third month of the quarter added a lot of complexity and time
pressure and I couldn't be prouder of the work dedication and collegiality exhibited by our team. Everyone from
the reconcilements area to the leaders of the department performed in an exemplary manner.
Not only did we close the merger three weeks before quarter end shortly after completing $200 million sub-debt
offering, but we also completed a conversion of the general ledger system in a merger of the two companies'
departments and job selection process for all finance and accounting personnel. The competency and work ethic
of this team gave us confidence to push forward with the June 7 closing and their performance is, I think, a
testament to one of the strengths of this merger, that is two great teams of outperformers coming together to form
one high-performing team. I'm pleased and proud to be associated with these folks.
I'm going to cover the following items this morning. The significant moving parts associated with the merger
closing that impacted our earnings and our balance sheet this quarter, a more significant purchase accounting
entries and the resultant loss absorption capacity are results both GAAP as-reported and operating combined
business basis, our capital position and an update on our merger efficiency realization.
Items associated with the merger closing. First, under CECL, we placed the credit and rate mark on the
CenterState loan portfolio, including both PCD loans and non-PCD loans. The credit mark on PCD loans resides
in the allowance for credit losses, but is not includable as Tier 2 capital. The entire mark on non-PCD loans credit
and rate is a contrast that reducing the carrying balance of these loans, and it is also not includable as Tier 2
capital.
Second, CECL also requires us to record a provision for credit losses on the non-PCD loans and this provision
expense runs through the income statement in the quarter of closing. This is the double count effect as these
loans have both the credit mark and an allowance for credit losses. Because our merger closed June 7 and due to
5

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
the impact of COVID on various economic factors that drives CECL loss estimates, we had a relatively high
provision expense for acquired CenterState non-PCD loans of $120 million caused by the merger and only three
weeks of CenterState operations to help cover that expense.
Third, as it's true with any merger, we've reported a number of merger-related costs and expenses, including legal
counsel, investment banking and employee and contract termination amounts that occur in a merger.
Credit marks and loss absorption capacity. Note that when I speak of ratios of allowance and credit mark
coverage, I'm excluding the PPP loans from the denominator due to their likely temporary existence and their
100% SBA guarantee. To determine our [ph] PCD (14:13) loans, we had several screening criteria, including pass
due status, credit grades, credit scores, et cetera, and we also categorized any loan on deferral status and the
entire lodging portfolio as PCD given COVID. The total PCD portfolio is approximately $3 billion, or roughly 25%
of the CenterState loans acquired. I'll remind you that the definition of PCD is not a problem loan.
Also note that the marks are preliminary and will be finalized in the coming quarters. The credit mark or allowance
on this $3 billion in PCD loans at quarter end was $150 million or approximately 5% of that portfolio. The
remaining $9 billion approximately in non-PCD loans, again, excluding PPP loans received a credit mark of $109
million, which is approximately 122 basis points. Given the screening process for identifying loans to categorize
as PCD, we believe the non-PCD portfolio to be clean.
Slide 9 shows the total loss absorption capacity on the balance sheet at June 30. $435 million in the allowance,
which is 188 basis points of loans, $173 million of which was at Legacy South State, another $21 million in the
reserve for unfunded commitments, which is another 9 basis point of loans and another $161 million in
unrecognized discounts on loans [ph] according to 69 basis points (15:37) of loans, which brings the total to $616
million, or approximately 2.66% of loans, as John mentioned.
While we all see storm clouds on the economic horizon, we had another quarter of very low net charge-offs,
almost zero for the quarter, and past dues continued to be low. Ending NPAs were 38 basis points of assets. Dan
is available to answer further questions on credit during the Q&A section of the call. Provision expense on the
legacy South State portfolio was $31 million, bringing the quarter end allowance level to approximately 153 basis
points of that portfolio, plus another 10 basis points for the reserve for unfunded commitments at Legacy South
State.
Given the minimal charge-offs and lack of growth in the quarter, the increase in the allowance was attributable to
changes in the economic forecasts. The other key purchase accounting entry was the core deposit intangible,
which received the mark of 114 basis points. Our $2.6 billion CD book was marked the other direction, as these
yields were above market at closing date, so our cost of these will decline accordingly from approximately 134
basis points to approximately 29 basis points.
Let me now discuss results for the quarter. For the quarter, we reported a loss of $85 million. Excluding the $120
million in the provision for credit losses on the acquired non-PCD loans and excluding the $40 million in merger-
related expenses in the quarter, adjusted earnings would have been $38.6 million or $0.89 per share. The timing
of the closing was a primary factor in the loss, with only 23 days of income production from Legacy CenterState
and the impact of the full provision expense on the acquired non-PCD loans as well as the merger-related costs.
Our net interest margin with the reduction in rates, buildup in liquidity, and the sale of about half of the
CenterState bond portfolio pre-close, we saw a margin compression in percentage terms, although the production
of net interest income and dollars showed less compression.

Loan yields were 4.25% for the quarter, down 42 basis points from Q1. Total cost of deposits was 29 basis points,
down 19 basis points from Q1. And we saw a nice growth in DDA balances. We saw compression on securities
due to the purchase accounting marks applied on the CenterState bonds and the shrinking of the total portfolio on
a combined basis also led to compression. Our reported net interest margin was 3.24% tax equivalent, down 44
basis points from Q1.
Let me talk for a minute about the underlying financial performance, which was strong as John said. Given the
mid-quarter close and associated merger accounting entries, we thought this information on a combined business
basis would be useful to you, so we have included several slides beginning on page 17 of the presentation. These
comments are on net basis, which are the GAAP historical numbers of each company without regard to purchase
accounting entries or any efficiencies that may be realized.
As John noted, our PPNR of $157 million was very consistent with the prior four quarters and the PPNR ROA of
168 basis points was strong in light of the expanded balance sheet due to PPP and liquidity. We had a record
combined revenue in Q2, up $22 million from the 2019 second quarter.
Slide 18 shows how the makeup of the revenue has changed over the last five quarters with non-interest income
moving from 21% of total revenue in the year-ago quarter to 28% in this quarter, providing the counter-cyclical
benefit we expect.
Slide 20 shows the growth in combined non-interest income from $74 million in the year-ago quarter to $108
million in this quarter. In a quarter with work-from-home and MOE and emerging of two mortgage management
groups, our combined mortgage teams did $1.5 billion in production which is impressive in a period with these
many distractions.
Our net interest margin on a combined business basis was 3.38%, down approximately 55 basis points from Q1
with net interest income on that basis down approximately $7 million. Combined loan growth was $1.97 billion, but
loans declined approximately $300 million excluding the PPP loans. Year-to-date combined loan growth,
excluding PPP loans, is basically flat. Combined deposit growth was $3.5 billion or $3.7 billion excluding
brokerage CDs.
Non-interest expenses were $175 million for the quarter or $135 million, excluding the merger-related expenses.
On a combined business basis for the full quarter, it would have been $225 million. Combined non-interest
expenses grew by approximately half of the growth in non-interest income from Q1 and approximately 60% of the
non-interest income growth from Q4, reflecting the strength of the commission-based businesses.
During the second quarter, we also had increased expenses associated with the pandemic. On a combined
business basis, our efficiency ratio in Q2 was 58%, up slightly from 57% combined in Q1.
On capital, our ending TCE ratio is 7.6%. Expansion of the balance sheet through the PPP reduced the ratio by
approximately 50 basis points. Our CET1 was 10.7% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 12.9%. Ending
tangible book value per share was $38.33, up $0.32 from Q1. As I noted, we also have solid loss absorption
capacity on the balance sheet.
Let me finish by updating you on merger-related expenses and cost saves. Our cost save process is well
underway and on target with numerous successful vendor negotiations, operating model and staffing templates
being constructed by business leads and cost targets for each. Our core conversion schedule for the middle of the
7

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
second quarter of 2021 giving us ample time to prepare to ensure good execution and we should begin to realize
the bulk of the remaining cost saves at that point.
We will recognize some cost saves in the latter part of this year but most will occur after the conversion. Through
June 30, we'd recognized $81 million in merger-related expenses. We continue to expect to be within our
originally announced $205 million total with an estimate of approximately 20% of the remaining amount in the last
half of 2020 and the remainder occurring in 2021. We expect the largest quarter for merger-related expenses to
be the second quarter of next year when we complete our system conversion. So a quarter with a lot of moving
parts with strong underlying performance, healthy loss absorption capacity and solid credit results thus far.
I'll turn it back to you John.

So let me start, I guess, this is a Will question primarily. I'm wondering if you could give us an idea just on the
impact – and excuse me if I missed this – the PPP specifically on the NIM and maybe some sort of basis point
estimate on what the excess liquidity impact is in NIM. And I guess, relative to the 3.38% that you put in the
presentation, where you think the NIM could normalize longer term, whenever that occurs?

I'm going to let Steve start with that question, Stephen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Hey Stephen, it's Steve. Yeah, just a couple of points on the NIM as we're combining the companies. Let me just
first of all remind us that this is a very core deposit funded bank. We have 1.1 million customers, 800,000
checking accounts.
If you see on page 23 in your deck, as Will mentioned, there was a lot of deposit growth over this past quarter on
a combined business basis, about $4.5 billion. Our checking accounts make up 54% of the deposits and our DDA
make up 33%. So very, very core funded. Of the $4.5 billion we grew in deposits, we have about $4 billion sitting
on the balance sheet in just excess liquidity, not invested in short-term funds.
Normally, we would probably have somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. So we have about $2.5 billion
to $3 billion more excess than normal. And that creates about 30 basis points of pressure on the margin. And
that's why you see in the deck that Will referenced the actual margin dollars didn't decline all that much, but the
margin percentage did. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Just to build the bridge, on a combined basis, we were 3.38%. And a couple of things to maybe keep in mind.
Number one, we did do the sub-debt offering toward the middle – or the end of the quarter. That creates a couple
of basis points pressure that's not in that 3.38%. Also on the fair value accounting that Will mentioned around
particularly the securities book, that portfolio was around 2.60% for half the securities book. We sold half of it in
March, the other half. So that creates another 10 basis points of pressure.
And then, ultimately, we did the fair value marks on the loan book. Of course, we already had some discounts on
the loan book and just really reloaded that. And then, of course, prepays kind of moved that. And then, the last
piece is just on the PPP program. We have a slide on the deck towards the end of the presentation, slide 34, that
talks about the amount of PPP [indiscernible] (26:31) fees that we have at the end of the quarter; it was about $67
million.
And, of course, depending on when that forgiveness time happens, we expect most of that toward the end of the
year, in the first of next year based on what we know today. That will impact margin going forward. So I know a lot
of moving parts, but hopefully, you'll see the 3.38% will be adjusted down from a percentage unless when we
move back the balance sheet, the investments towards the another $1 billion. So hopefully, that's helpful for you.

William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
I'm sorry, Stephen. With respect to the PPP question impact on the margin, it really didn't have a very significant
impact, because we had some fee recognition in the quarter as you see that on slide 34. So the net impact of
lower yield on that portfolio in terms of the base rate combined with the fees, it really wasn't very impactful to the
margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Great. And then, I don't know if you had talked about this plan beforehand, but the large – [ph]
selling half of the (17:35) securities portfolio, and it looked like maybe there was about $40 million gain on
securities there prior to the deal close. What was the logic there, I guess, there was a thought process, especially,
given all the excess liquidity in the systems, I'm just surprised, you would sell an earning asset there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure, Stephen. This is Steve. Under fair value accounting rules, we have to mark those securities to market. So
effectively, you get those yields going forward. And when we completed the merger, those security yields were in
the 1.25% range. So we just decided to put some on the shelf, and let's see how we progressed through the PPP
and other things, just to be conservative, so that we didn't invest all of our securities or half the security book in at
1.25%. And we'll just have to layer that back in over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

All right. Got it. Yeah. That's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
And if you think about it, Stephen, there's some great bonds that we sold, but there were great bonds closer to
par. We don't like them as much with the kind of premium handle we're going to have on them, because as Steve
said, you're effectively buying them at acquisition date. So that played into our thinking as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Very helpful. And then, just one last thing from me, I guess, and maybe this a Steve question as well. But
it looks like, [indiscernible] (29:00) run rate the Legacy Center's data, correspondent business looks like maybe
$33 million for a full quarter based off that $8.3 million number given. I'm wondering how you think about that
business moving forward, the trends there. And then, I guess, it was slide 20, you gave the combined non-interest
income of $108 million for this past quarter, which obviously is kind of a big jump from the back half of last year on
a combined basis, if that is in the apples-to-apples. So just frame up the trends if you could and especially that
correspondent banking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure, Stephen. I'll take that question. As it relates to what John had talked about in his prepared remarks, we've
tried to build the business so that when rates go up, of course, our core funding will just – the margin will increase.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
But when rates decrease, we have some counter-cyclical businesses that hopefully offset some of that pressure –
it won't offset all of it, but it will offset some of it. And you've seen that as our PPNR has been fully flat year-over-
year. So that's a high level comment.
As it relates to the $108 million on slide 20, I'll give you the breakdown on a combined business basis for the
quarter. The mortgage banking income would have been about $43 million. $30 million would have been – rough
numbers would have been the correspondent banking. And then about $7.5 million to $7.8 million would have
been the wealth management business. So those three add up to about $81 million of the $108 million. The other
$27 million would just be the ordinary service charges card fees kind of reoccurring fees.
As far as our outlook on those businesses, as I mentioned, mortgage had a blowout quarter. And as John
mentioned or Will mentioned, $1.5 billion worth of production, which was just superb, given that we've had less –
we had fewer than 10 employees in the office to be able to do that. This really speaks highly of the team and [ph]
Tom and Stephen and Brent (31:11). That business continue – the pipelines continue to be strong. And so as best
we can tell, that business continues to do well.
As it relates to the correspondent business, fixed income has picked up in that business. The interest rate swap
business has been very good. I would expect over time that the interest rate swap business in an environment like
this would not be as good over the next few quarters, still be strong, but just be less strong just given the credit
environment generally around that. So hopefully that's helpful. We think the business itself, the non-interest
income fee businesses and the business owners who own that, they've just done a great job, and it's really helped
out in the middle of a lot of margin pressure.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Question on your lending pipeline. What kind of near-term loan growth are you expecting and what are you seeing
in terms of interest from your borrowers right now? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Jennifer. This is John. I'll take that. You're watching this play out on the evening news every night as states
open and then they close again. And I've had the chance to travel around this quarter to five of our six states,
trying to get a pulse of what's going on. I've had calls with all of our Presidents. For the quarter – the last quarter,
we did see the loan portfolios decline slightly in five of our six states, but we actually saw some growth in the state
of North Carolina. Generally, the pipelines are down now about 25% to 30%.
And I think our approach is we really want to lean in and take care of our existing clients through this process. But
as far as new business is concerned, we want to be prudent and conservative in our underwriting until there's
more clarity [ph] past the (33:40) virus. So I do think that new loan growth will be somewhat muted in the next
couple of quarters as we navigate through this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. And my second question is on cost savings. Will, you said you have some cost savings in the second
half of this year. Can you give us a sense of how much of that $80 million might be realized this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
You know, Jennifer, it won't be a significant amount. The bulk of it will come in 2021 and the largest, of course,
once we do our system conversion, but there are savings we realize along the way both through some head count
reduction and some vendor renegotiations, but the vast majority of them will come in 2021. I don't have a good
hard number to give you for the rest of this year. But I don't want you to think we hadn't achieved some already
and won't be achieving some more this year.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Just I appreciate all the comments and all the detail on how you're looking at the loss absorption, just between the
traditional reserve build and all the complexity – accounting complexity with the deal, but then also the fair value
discounts on the acquired loans. So all that being said, how do you all think about reserve building going forward?
We're obviously going to learn new information. September 30 got a new update on the duration of what we're
looking at and get new forecasts.
But I have to think given that 2.66%, it's a fair statement that if you agree with it, the bulk of reserve building is
behind you. But if that's true, I'm just trying to get a sense for how you're going to look at the reserve or
provisioning over the back half of the year, and particularly as it relates to the $67 million in PPP fees coming due,
13

will most of that fall to the bottom line? Or will you look to take a chunk of that and throw more to the reserve? Or
are there other things? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Thank you, Kevin. I'll take a stab at that. And if Dan wants to elaborate, he can if needed. Like everyone, our
CECL model has a number of loss drivers in it. And the loss drivers are based upon economic forecasts, given
the forward-looking nature of the CECL. So as of June 30, we feel like our process led to the appropriate level of
reserves based upon economic forecasts at that time. Should they worsen from here? We and the industry as a
whole will need to build reserves further from this level.
So I think if I were to convey to you a great deal of confidence about where I thought provisions were heading for
us or anyone else at this point, that would be misleading. There's just too much – too many unanswered
questions and too much unknown about how this pandemic and its impact on the economy goes.
But we feel very good about the reserves we have on the balance sheet today, very good about the capital
position and that degree of unrecognized capital we have. And like we – I think I referenced in my comments but
also in the deck, a portion of that doesn't make its way into our capital ratios. The allowance on the PCD loans of
about $150 million is not in capital, and, of course, the discounts aren't either. So about $300 million of that
number does not appear in our capital ratios. But anyway, it's a bit of a non-answer because frankly we just don't
have a good crystal ball at this point about future economic forecasts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. All right. Thank you, Will. One just additional question, deferrals, I guess, looks like decline to a little under
12% on a combined basis. And I know a lot of banks are seeing a lot of moving parts over – in coming weeks
between more around one deferrals maturing and additional new entrants to round two extensions. I'm just
curious based on what you're seeing now where you think that 11.7%-or-so of deferrals settles, when you get
toward the end of August or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Kevin, it's John. Dan Bockhorst is on the line. He is our Chief Credit Officer and he's got a pretty good
handle on that. Dan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Thank you, John. If you look at that slide 32 of the deck, so far approximately, 40% of the deferrals have
expired. And the percentage of the loans on deferral has declined from approximately 17.5% to that 11.5%
number. As another 50% of deferrals expire over the next several weeks, we expect that trend to continue and we
estimate we'll end up in the mid-single-digit percentage of loans on deferral. The future is still somewhat unknown
on what the continued impact of COVID-19 will be. And there is the potential for [indiscernible] (40:02) in deferrals
long term, but we like the way the trends are going right now.

And, Kevin, this is Will. I'll just – let me also just remind you one thing that's not unique, but somewhat unique to
us, and that is that with the acquisition, as you see in the deck, we articulated the categories or the screening
process for determining PCD loans. And all of the lodging portfolio from CenterState, and all of the loans on
deferral from CenterState were classified as PCD. And as you saw, the PCD book has about a 5% mark on it. So
we think we have an appropriate capital set aside hopefully for those as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
And on the second deferral, John, to your comment earlier about you thought it was the right approach to be
generous. I'm assuming when folks ask for second, there's much more of a rigorous credit-driven process being
applied to them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. That's exactly right. Dan, you want to comment on the credit process when someone ask for a second
renewal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. For the second renewal, there is a much more rigorous process. We're updating financials, really
determining that there is a need that the deferral request is coming from a company that has been impacted by
the current economic environment and we're also really pushing strong for those that do get a second deferral.
That second deferral is interest only as opposed to a full principal linked and interest deferral. On round one,
about 26 of the deferrals were interest only. And in round two, it's still a little bit early, but about 37% right now are
on interest only. So we like the way that trend is heading and it's going in the right direction.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A lot of great color on the PPNR forecast. I think my only follow-up on that is just on the combined expense base,
Will, I think you said that combined, you're at about $225 million. And is it fair to say it doesn't feel like there's a lot
of one-time kind of in that number? It feels like you probably have a little bit of elevated from mortgage but – in the
fee income, but assuming that that all stays fairly strong near term, you should probably have expenses stay
around that level. And then, it feels like the $3 million you mentioned was paying for extra staff, maybe that's
offset by the FAS 91, so you're kind of awash there. And so, I guess, big picture is that $225 million is a good core
number to grow from here from the back half of the year before we start layering on cost savings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah, Catherine. Let me start that and maybe Steve can talk a little bit about the efficiency ratios in those
businesses. But it is – given the strength of our non-interest income business lines, that does make the job of
forecasting not any more difficult because those business lines compensation structures, as you know, are largely
incentive-based or commission-based. And so when we see growth in revenue in those business lines, obviously,
we see growth in expenses.
I mentioned in my comments that the relative NIE growth from prior quarters relative to the non-interest income
growth in prior quarters, but that does make it a little more of a challenge. So the answer to your question is at
current levels of non-interest income production, the NIE levels would probably be a good estimate where we'll
be. If those were to fall or rise from here then it would accordingly react.
But, Steve, you want to mention something about the efficiency of those businesses a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure, Will. Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I think there is a – back to the slides on the deck towards the end of the
presentation it gives a historical perspective of the financial statements and it looks at that the trend rate for non-
interest expense and for non-interest income. And one of the things you'll notice, for instance, is in the fourth
quarter, our non-interesting was around $87 million, our adjusted non-interest expense was in the $212 million.
So if you run that math forward, you can see that we've had additional non-interest income of $22 million in the
last couple of quarters, and about additional non-interest expense of about $13 million. So that – it's really running
an additional 60% efficiency ratio on the additional non-interest income. And, of course, that's blended across all
those commission businesses. But I think that's a general good way to model it depending. Hope that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. That's really helpful. Yes. Thank you so much, Steve. It's great. And then, this is a CECL question since
this is a new role for all of us. And so my question is, Will, you mentioned that you put most of the – or all the ones
that are in the lodging book and then all of the CenterState ones that are deferral into PCD? And so as those roll
off deferral, does that change anything with your reserve or the way to you think about your board expected
losses, or because you just categorize that as PCD, you don't have to make any kind of quarter-to-quarter change
as the quality of those loans perhaps get better or worse?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Catherine, once a loan is PCD, it's PCD unless we make – unless we have another decision event around – re-
underwriting, if you will. So they are PCD forever. As we determine the need for the allowance [indiscernible]
(46:37) the economy improves and forecasts and it dictates a lower reserve needed than we have, then it comes
back in via reduced provisioning, or I guess, in some circumstances, negative provisioning. So that's how it works.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That sounds good. But just coming off the deferral wouldn't necessarily generate a large reserve release in
that estimate, I guess [indiscernible] (47:03).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
No, no, it would really be more – that might be a good credit factor about our thoughts about that collectability of
that loan, of course, but that in and of itself, no..
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. Great. And then, just one kind of just big picture question, [indiscernible] (47:17) markets, I feel like
last we spoke some of your coastal markets were doing actually relatively better than any other markets of the
country, and of course, we're hearing of a lot more COVID cases in Florida and along the coast. And so just, can
you provide just some broad general color around what you're hearing from your customers in your local
businesses, and any specific markets or types of credit that you're more worried about now than you may have
been in the last quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Sure, Catherine. This is John. As I mentioned, I have traveled to five of the six states and I've had calls with all of
the market Presidents in the last two weeks, I've got a lot of feedback from them. So let me describe for you what
I'm seeing as the new COVID economy, because there's winners and losers in the new COVID economy.
Anything that's related to home improvement is slant. They're just as busy as they've ever been. Residential is
performing very good. Residential construction is performing very good. There's not a lot of residential product on
the market. So I'm hearing of cases of multiple offers on homes. I'm hearing of cases where people are
purchasing homes through video chat.
From a recreation standpoint, where people are so cooped up at home, businesses that are connected to the
boating business, so the RV business are doing phenomenally well. I heard a story, you cannot buy a bicycle in
the city of Charlotte because those businesses have performed so well.
Trucking and logistics, you think about what's going on with the distribution channels right now, they're performing
very well. I'm hearing that out of Lakeland, Florida, hearing that out of Charlotte.
Medical. Medical has bounced back. Interesting note – somebody said the cosmetic surgery business has
performed very well because you can have cosmetic surgery now and recover at home in privacy. So dental
businesses. The dental business is basically shut down in the month of April. They're all back and the dental
17

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2020
businesses that ask for deferral, none of them are asking for a second deferral. So those are all very positive
elements of the new COVID economy.
The negatives are kind of obvious. It's anything event-driven, whether that's conferences, or catering, those
businesses are suffering.
Hotels. Hotels, it's kind of a tale of two stories. There's leisure hotels and then there's business hotels. The leisure
hotels are really coming back. And that represents about two-thirds of our hotel budget, more leisure-oriented. If
you can get these hotels up to about 40% to 50% occupancy, they can start carrying their P&I payments on a
breakeven basis, and we're seeing that with the leisure side. The business side, however, is a different story.
That's going to be a lot longer recovery cycle.
And then, on the retail side, clearly longer term, we've known that there's the secular trends in retail. But for our
book, it's very tenant-specific. The single tenant businesses seem to performing better. Anything with a drive-thru
seems to be performing better. So we don't see near as much lost content in the retail side as we would in the
restaurant space. So I hope that gives you some color of what we're seeing as far as the new COVID economy.

Yes, that is happening now. That is primarily a third quarter event. In the second quarter, we saw a migration into
watch. In this quarter for those businesses that are seeking a second round of deferrals, we're evaluating those
risk ratings, most of them would probably end up in a criticized-type category as we go through this quarter.

a fair value mark, and then it pays off, and perhaps it's renewed as a new loan. How do you reserve for that?
Does the reserve before the fair value mark become a guidepost and how you treat that new loan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah, Chris, my answer would be that that's a separate discrete decision at that point. And the past mark or
allowance required for that loan would not necessarily be a guide for what the future would be. It may very well be
correlated, but that wouldn't be the guide in my view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sure. Sure. And I know all of us have a very, very cloudy economic crystal ball. Hopefully, what we and the

losses. But, at this point, it's just too hard to know what's going to happen in the economy, so.

Hey, guys. Thanks. So let me throw one more in here. John, I appreciate all your comments about the new
COVID economy. That was incredibly helpful. I was wondering just in particular, you guys noted the exposures
around your retail loans being primarily in three of the Florida markets. And I'm just curious in particular those
markets that you're seeing, I think, it was – can't find my slide, but I think it was Tampa, maybe Orlando, and one
other market. I'm just kind of curious again, maybe piggybacking of Catherine's question just what you're seeing in
terms of new shutdowns or fear down there in those markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Good question, Stephen. Florida has been on the forefront of opening the economy. And it does not seem
like there's political will to close the economy. Things have opened up considerably. I would tell you the markets in
Miami-Dade County, Broward and Palm Beach, they're going to be the more restrictive economies whereas
Tampa and Orlando are not as restrictive.
