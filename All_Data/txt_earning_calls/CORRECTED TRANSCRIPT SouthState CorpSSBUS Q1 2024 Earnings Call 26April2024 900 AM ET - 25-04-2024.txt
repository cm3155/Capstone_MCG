John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Thank you, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. As you've seen in our earnings release,
SouthState delivered a solid and steady quarter that was consistent with our guidance. At a high level, it was
another quarter of positive, but modest growth for both loans and deposits. Asset quality continues to be good
with past dues, non-accruals and charge-offs all declining in the quarter.
Net interest margin dipped to the low end of our guidance, but should be at or near bottom. And capital ratios are
on the higher end of our peer group and have grown every quarter over the last year. Like every other banker and
investor, we're trying to understand the broader macro picture, the risk of a recession and what the yield curve is
going to look like. At the same time, we believe the dynamics will be different in every region of the country.
As we study our bank and our markets, commercial loan pipelines took a sharp drop of about 25% following the
banking turmoil last spring, and they stayed low through the summer and early fall. But by November, pipelines
started growing again and in the last few months have now returned to the same level they were before the
banking turmoil. And the momentum seems to be building, which is encouraging. But with rates where they are
CRE activity, not surprising is much slower. So nearly all the pipeline growth and momentum has been in the C&I
portfolio. In fact, as it relates to commercial real estate, our concentration ratios for both CRE and construction are
at the lowest levels they've been in three years.
Dan Bockhorst and our credit team are doing a great job servicing and analyzing our loan portfolio. And while
rising interest rates are putting pressure on debt service coverage ratios, the South is disproportionately
benefiting from net migration. And we clearly see that in the rental rate trends on all types of commercial real
estate. In the last three years, rental rates in our markets have increased 16% for office, compared to 3% outside
our markets. Rental rates are up 21% in multifamily versus 14% outside our markets, and rents are up 38% in
industrial compared to 24% outside our markets.
On fee income, we were up for the quarter. We saw some improvement in mortgage as the gain on sale margin
opened up. Wealth management continues to be a reliable and growing contributor, and we now have assets
under management over $8 billion. And our correspondent division recently expanded with the addition of a new
team that specializes in the packaging and sale of the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans. This is a
long-standing and experienced team based in Houston and Steve can give you more information.
And finally, as we think about capital management, over the last year, we've maintained a level balance sheet, it's
$45 billion in assets while earning a return on tangible common equity in the mid-teens. As a result, we've seen
our capital ratios increase every quarter. Our CET1 currently sits at about 12%. We've also significantly increased
our loan loss reserves, which currently sit at 1.6%. I mentioned earlier that we're all trying to play economist and
forecast the yield curve and obviously we don't have a crystal ball. And the only thing we know for sure is that all
of our forecasts will be wrong. So our goal is flexibility and optionality. And with these higher levels of capital and
reserves, we're in a perfect position to be opportunistic, regardless if we have a soft landing, a hard landing or no
landing at all.
I'll pass it back to Will now to walk you through the details on the quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
Thank you, John. Total revenue for the quarter was in line with forecasts as NIM came in at the lower end of our
guidance range at 3.41% and non-interest income to average assets came in above guidance at 64 basis points.
Deposit costs increased 14 basis points, which was 2 basis points less than last quarter's increase. And the cost
of deposits at 1.74%, was in line with our guidance. Loan yields increased 8 basis points. That brings our
cumulative total of deposit beta to 33% and our cumulative loan beta to 37%. Deposit mix shift was part of that
deposit cost increase though the shift appears to have slowed. The average mix of DDAs to total deposits at
28.5% and Q1 was down from Q4's average 29.9%. However, Q1's beginning, ending and average mix were all
in the 28.5% range. Steve will give some color on our future margin guidance in the Q&A.
Relative to Q4, our net interest income declined $10 million with one fewer day. Non-interest income was $6
million higher. Total revenue declined by $4 million sequentially. The non-interest income beat was driven by
better mortgage revenue and lower interest on swap variation margin collateral. NIE, excluding non-recurring
items was down $4.9 million versus Q4, but that's partially due to the adoption of the proportional amortization
method for low income housing tax credits. This adoption shortens the period over which these credits are
amortized and essentially reduced NIE by a net $2.1 million and moved about $3.5 million in passive losses to the
income tax line. Thus, in comparing NIE and PPNR for Q1 versus Q4 on a normalized basis, if you adjust for this
accounting method adoption, Q1 NIE would have been down $2.8 million compared with Q4 and Q1 PPNR would
have been down $1.5 million from Q4.
We had some positives and negatives in NIE. The first quarter, had the usual higher FICA and 401(k) expense,
which was offset by lower professional fees associated with projects as well as lower business development and
travel expense. For the full year, we still think NIE in the $990 million to $1 billion area is a good estimate,
dependent of course, on expense items that vary with revenue. With respect to income taxes, in addition to the
impact of the accounting method adoption I mentioned, we had two non-recurring items related to a state DTA
revaluation and amended state tax returns driving our tax expense up by $3 million. For future quarters, we
expect to see an effective tax rate in the 23.5% range, absent any other unanticipated, discrete or non-recurring
adjustments.
Our $12.7 million and provision for credit losses versus $2.7 million and net charge-offs caused our total reserve
to grow by 2 basis points to 1.6%. NPAs were down slightly. We saw some continued loan migration into
substandard as we monitor and downgrade credits due to higher interest costs. With many of these being floating
rate borrowers, that could reduce their rate by 150 basis points or so, if they fix their rate using the swap curve.
But many are reluctant to do so at this point due to expectations of lower rates or a sale.
I'll note that the largest addition to the substandard list from Q4 paid off in Q1 with the properties selling for an
amount that was approximately 134% of our loan balance. That was clearly a substandard loan with very little risk
of loss, as evidenced by the margin of safety and the sale price versus our loan balance only one quarter after our
downgrade. I'll note that our expectation continues to be that we will not see significant losses in the loan portfolio
based upon current forecasts.
Lastly, on the balance sheet front, growth was moderate with loans up 3.5% annualized and deposits up 1.4%
annualized with brokered CDs essentially flat. We repurchased another 100,000 shares in the quarter and our
capital ratios remain very healthy, putting us in a good position with plenty of optionality, we believe.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we
will take our first question from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time here. I'm just wondering if you guys can walk through kind of
how you're thinking about the NIM from here? I think last quarter we were looking at four cuts in maybe 2024 and
four in 2025. So just given the move in the forward curve and how that might shift gear, your guidance on the
NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Stephen, this is Steve. Good morning. Yeah. As you mentioned, just to kind of give you the framework of
the NIM discussion. Last quarter, we're at 3.41%, deposit costs were 1.74%. Kind of our guidance going forward
continues on three things, its interest earning assets, our rate forecast and deposit beta. So on our interest
earning assets, the first part, we'd mentioned full year would be average, around $41 billion. So there's really no
change to that guidance. We still think loan growth is sort of mid-single-digit. We think deposit growth is in that 2%
to 3% range. And then we use the investment portfolio runoff to fund that loan growth. So I think from an interest
earning asset, that really hasn't changed.
On the rate forecast last quarter, I think Moody's, I mentioned four rate cuts in 2024 and four and 2025. This
quarter, Moody's baseline shows two cuts in 2024 and four cuts in 2025. So that's two less, two fewer rate cuts
than we originally projecting.
The third piece is just deposit beta. Page 17 shows our cycle-to-date beta 33%, and we would expect quarter
going forward that deposit costs to increase sort of in the 5 basis points to 10 basis points in the second quarter.
And some, assuming we get a rate cut in the third quarter, which is what the Moody's baseline says, we would
peak somewhere in the mid-1.80s on deposit costs. So with all those assumptions, we would expect NIM for the
full year 2024 to range between 3.40% and 3.50% and sort of start from the lower end than the first quarter to the
higher end in the fourth quarter.
And as you mentioned, I think at the previous quarter, we guided 3.45% to 3.55%. And really the difference in the
guidance is based on the rate cut forecast having only two cuts versus four cuts, which really cost us about 5
basis points in 2024. So that's kind of how we're thinking about, based on the Moody's baseline and happy to
answer any additional questions on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. No, that's really helpful, Steve. And so based on that change, you guys in practice look like you're slightly
liability sensitive then if the NIM is a little better with more cuts and does this move into more C&I lending, does
that start to change that dynamic slowly over time?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
I think, Stephen, it probably does over time, but I don't think it materially changes anything in the short run. I
mean, one of the questions that investors have asked us is, if rate cut stay flat, kind of how does that affect your
NIM? And for us, we've talked about our fixed rate book, our fixed rate loan book that continues to be sort of a
tailwind to margin. And this quarter, our total loan yield went up, I think 8 basis points. So, we'll probably continue
to see that somewhere between 7 basis points and 10 basis points of movement in the loan yield on a go-forward
basis, assuming higher for longer in the rate cuts.
And our deposit costs probably will go up somewhere between 5 basis points and 10 basis points if we continue
on this path. So we kind of see sort of the NIM bottoming out. And then for us, we think that each rate cut from
here, whenever that happens and it's somewhere between 3 basis points and 5 basis points of NIM improvement
per cut. And so we can go into that math if you'd like at some point. But that's sort of how we're thinking about that
3.40% to 3.50% range. If we have to cuts, we probably see it getting in the upper 3.40s by the end of the year. If
we're, no rate cuts, it's probably sort of that 3.40% the 3.45% range would be our current expectation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Very helpful. And then just the last thing for me, what kind of metrics might you guys have on hand and you
looked at stressing your portfolio for higher rates, for potentially higher for longer. And what that looks like as
these fixed rate loans reprice higher, do you have any metrics kind of showing what happens to debt service
coverage or kind of what gives you comfort around the loan book as a whole?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Steve, we had a tick up in our substandards really for the last few quarters and it went up a little bit this
quarter, little less than it did the prior quarter. And to your point, it's predominantly a rising rate story. And then
some of it's from tenant downsizing the office portfolio, but as Will said earlier, we don't see loss content in that
portfolio.
Stepping back, there's tangible non-subjective asset quality metrics and then there's subjective tangible,
subjective grading metrics. The tangible metrics, past dues, non-accruals charge-offs were all down for the
quarter. And then as we think about loan grading, we've seen a lot of different approaches in the banks we've
acquired over the years. Our approach is simple. If a loan is $1 below breakeven cash flow, we graded
substandard, even if it has 50% cash equity, the guarantor got millions in liquidity. There's no risk of loss. But I'll
give you some specifics.
Our largest loan, as Will mentioned in the fourth quarter, they got added a substandard paid off at a substantial
profit and then the largest one that added in the first quarter kind of getting back to your question about stressing
it, it's a floating rate multifamily development loan in Georgia. I checked on it yesterday. It's reached 90%
occupancy, but it's got a [ph] 0.93 (00:17:23) debt service coverage because it's a floating rate and it's scheduled
to go to the permanent market, the Fannie Mae market in the fourth quarter. And it's going to cash flow fine
because the exit rates about 125 basis points less than the current floating rate.
So we've got detail in the deck that shows you our average debt service coverage ratios. We've kind of gone in
and looked quarter-by-quarter at the rate reset risk over the next two years. And we've got something in the deck
that says we're about 7% or 8% of our commercial real estate loans reset per year for the next two years. So it's
6


SouthState Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
not a lot. And as we stress those to the current rate, they're all still cash flow and in the low 1%. So we just don't
see a lot of loss content there even though we may move the substandards up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A follow-up question so that on the Moddy's average have size of some of the substandard loans that increased, I
know your average loan sizes is very low. And that's part of what we love about the risk in your portfolio. But could
you talk about some of the changes that we saw in office and multifamily and the substandard? And are there any
kind of larger credits within that or are those still there, is it just kind of I guess, is it a lot of smaller credits or are
there kind of a couple of larger credits they were kind of speaking to some of the details that you just gave within
that, John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. So the move, Catherine, in the first quarter, there's probably four or five loans that make up 75% or 80% of
those, the largest of which is that multifamily loan I mentioned. That's at [ph] 0.93 (00:19:21) debt service
coverage. It's going to be fine. It'll go to the permanent market in the fourth quarter. There's a couple office loans
in there. One of them, it's a tenant remix story, but it's got a good guarantor, good location. We don't think there's
loss on that. There's one that's a – in the $10 million, $15 million range, we might take a reserve on that of a
couple of million dollars. But that kind of gives you a flavor of the top three or four.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's helpful. And then your comment, Will on, so it was interesting, you said if the borrower chose to
move the loan from floating to fixed, then there would be, it's basically the credit would be fine. Can you just kind
of talk about that dynamic and what you're seeing in your borrowers appetite for that?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Sure. Will and John can fill in what I leave out. I mean, essentially, with the inverted yield curve, that presents an
opportunity. I just mentioned in my remarks that fixed rate loan would be at a lower rate. But a lot of the borrowers
who have plans to, in many cases, exit the property like the one that happened in the first quarter. And they don't
want to fixed the rate, even though the debt service requirement will go down and some have plans to go to
current market. But maybe they're not at the stage – to be playing the game a little bit and think that rates may go
down from here. So maybe and finalizing stabilization period or early stabilization period, so they can't yet go the
permanent market, all those kind of factors I think are in play there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. And then maybe just add that, obviously that, nobody wants a prepayment penalty right before you sell it.
So that would probably be the other factor there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That makes sense. Okay, that's great. And still, as you're seeing and you're looking at your classifieds today, are
there any that you look at that you made – that may have that you think there's a high likelihood that they migrate
from substandard into non-accrual, or is it more just this kind of rate dynamic that's driving all of it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. When you dig into that substandard portfolio, the past due portion of that Catherine is only 12 basis points.
So really, this is not a payment issue. This is not a collateral issue. It's really just a cash flow issue that's we think
is temporary because of this rate phenomenon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
It's not, Catherine that we know for certain that our NPAs don't move up from here a little bit. It's hard to have a
crystal ball in that regard. But two things I'd say is, one, we – our team digging through our portfolio still does not
see material loss content. And secondly, as you know from following us, but – as we highlighted in the deck,
we've built our reserves proactively, pretty significantly last couple years as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes, for sure. Okay. That's all really helpful. I don't dig it on credit, but just wanted to clarify a couple of the things.
And then the one thing on the margin I wanted to ask about, in the higher for longer rate scenario that you kind of
laid out, Steve, do you think and it's kind of amazing that you still think in that scenario the deposit costs are just
kind of increasing by that 5 basis point? I think you said about 5 basis points to 10 basis points kind of a quarter
and still the margin is able to stabilize.
Can you just kind of talk about in a higher for longer rate scenario, maybe where you think deposit costs peak out
versus the mid-180s range that you talked about if we start to get cuts in the back half of the year?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. I think, you never can measure this by a month or even 45 days. But I'd say the general commentary that
we're seeing right now is that, post-January, maybe a little bit of February, we did see a little bit of a deceleration
in deposit costs. Now, again, there's been three – two inflation reports. And so the answer is, I don't know. But I
do think, what we're seeing anyway is that deposit costs are moderate. And you're seen that through the industry
too and I think we're seeing that so far.
But to your point, if deposit costs are still or if the Fed funds are still [ph] 5.5 (00:23:52) in December, where our
deposit costs be, I think the way we're thinking about it or modeling it is somewhere between 5 basis points to 10
basis points a quarter, would be higher. Our loan yields are going to go up 7 basis points to 10 basis points
somewhere in there. And we would think margin would kind of hold in there because of those two factors. But
that's the crystal ball is not that great on the higher for longer, that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

John C. Corbett A

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe for – good morning – maybe just for Steve. Just if we are in this higher for longer environment and
understanding that you just kind of added a team to the correspondent business, but just wanted to get your kind
of updated expectations, as it relates to kind of the fixed income and the swap piece and then the other
components and how we should just be thinking about maybe that fee to average asset ratio, which was kind of at
the higher end of the guidance that you previously laid out? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. No, Michael, we're through the guidance, as you mentioned. So I'll tell you, that was a great quarter for fee
income, but much better than we expected, to be honest with you. To your mentioned, our fee income was $72
million or 64 basis points, which was higher than our guide of 55 basis point to 55 basis point in the first half of the
year. And as you mentioned, we have two interest rate sensitive businesses primarily one being mortgage and
one being correspondent. So, as I think what we mentioned before was we thought that, non-interest income to
average assets would be sort of in that 55 basis point to 60 basis point in the first half of the year until they cut
rates. And that would be 60 basis point to 65 basis point in the back half. And then as we get into 2025, as they
really start moving through rate cuts, 60 basis point to 70 basis point.

SouthState Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
And the way I would characterize it, I'd just say it's been delayed a little bit. So they don't cut rates until the third
quarter. I would kind of expect our non-interest income to average assets to sort of that 55 basis point to 60 basis
point range. And then as they cut rates, that'll create some volatility and other things for both mortgage, fixed
income and our swap desk. And that we think that towards the end of the year in that 55 basis points to 60 basis
points and really our guidance for 2025 hasn't changed, 60 basis point to 70 basis point, which is the 60 basis
points to 70 basis points is really what 2022 non-interest income to average assets. So kind of a pathway of sort
of benign. We're kind of at the lows of these businesses until we start seeing some rate movement and then it'll
move up 5 basis point or so basis points. And then from there, as we really get down the rate cutting cycle, we'd
see it kind of go up 10 basis point to 15 basis point, which is a bit more normal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe just one for John. I know it's really hard to predict the
economy, but just wanted to get a sense for the competitive landscape. And I know you guys are somewhat
cautious, always kind of have been and have a great world view. But is the environment where people are starting
to pull back, is that creating opportunities for you guys with a bigger balance sheet versus a lot of the banks in
your marketplace and just wanted to get a sense for borrower demand and your willingness to make loans at this
point in the cycle? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Borrower demand is up, Michael. We said in our prepared remarks the pipelines really shrunk after Silicon
Valley last spring, but in November, they really started picking up. So our pipelines are up about 33% since
November, a little over $1 billion. Most of it is C&I. It's pretty broad-based. It's not CRE related. You think about
the Southeast, clearly there's the net migration story, but there's a lot to the manufacturing story in the Southeast.
We've opened seven new auto plants in the last three years for electric vehicles and batteries. And every one of
those plants is thousands of new jobs.
Generally speaking, there's fewer supply chain issues than there were before. The ports are not backed up at
Savannah and Charleston, like they were, container shipping cost, has come back down to $2,500 a container.
But labor is still tight. There's some slack maybe in white collar jobs, but there's a considerable labor shortage still
in construction and hospitality. So overall, it feels like the Southeast is going to continue to grow and be able to
work its way through these interest rate increases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. Maybe just finally for me, it looks like you guys repurchased a little bit of common stock. Again, this
quarter, your capital levels are pretty solid. Just any thoughts there just given where the stock is trading, I
understand your premium for most peers, but just want to get a sense for what the thought process around the
buyback? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Michael, well, I think our attitude remains one of A, being opportunistic and being having the ability and
flexibility to use that buyback authorization, particularly if we see weakness when the window is open. I think we
also though value the optionality that we think we have from a strong capital and strong reserve position to allow

us to grow organically, to execute other things with our capital. So I think, sitting here today, we like the flexibility
being able to do something with it, but we also like the strong capital position we're in. And we think accreting
capital probably continues to make sense for the...

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So I wanted to follow-up on the comments around the acceleration in deposit costs, I guess some acceleration in
the quarter. Could you kind of describe where you saw that as far as what type of accounts, what type of
customers, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Hey, Brandon. It's Steve. I would call it a deceleration in deposit costs. Last quarter, I think let me think through. I
think the second quarter shows that on page 17, I think, but in the second quarter – excuse me, the third quarter,
our deposit were up 33 basis points. I think the fourth quarter, they were up 16 basis points and then the fourth –
and the first quarter they were up 14 basis points. So it's been coming down.
And I think in that, as we look at the first quarter, there's a bit of a remix and some seasonality. I guess as I think
about the deposit base sort of some of the pluses and minuses happening in the first quarter. So the minuses first
would be just around public funds. Typically there's some seasonality. Those typically have a little bit higher
deposit cost and those ran down a couple of hundred million, which is typical in the first quarter. On the positive
side, we had really good growth and have over the last couple of quarters in our Homeowners Association
business, over $100 million a team led by Jarrod Hurd. And that team brings in a little bit lower cost of deposits or
significantly lower cost of deposits with a lot of cash management business. So I kind of look at it as there's a bit
of a remix within that whole deposit piece, but I wouldn't – certainly wouldn't call it accelerating. I would call it
decelerating the general rule.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. I was referring to kind of, I guess, the pickup after the CPI reports that you alluded to.

John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Oh, sorry. No, if I – I may have been misunderstood, I think what I was saying was that we did see during the
quarter a deceleration of deposit costs. But it's hard to know as we continue to see these other CPI reports as we
think in the second, third and fourth quarter how that plays out. But what we actually see on the ground is a little
bit of deceleration and that's why our guide is kind of in that 5 basis points to 10 basis points of deposit costs
versus 14 last quarter. But if we stay in the higher for longer, how will that look in the third or fourth quarter? I
don't know that we know for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, okay. Thanks for the clarity. And I guess in regards to credit, I recognize the movement in special mention,
substandard, but not really affecting loss content. But in your view, how do you see the potential credit loss
trajectory if kind of rate stay here for a while. And even if, long-term yields continue to rise higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
We're trying to forecast and ask our credit team that same question and we're trying to understand where the loss
content might come from in a higher for longer. So we remain the other day and Steve asked our Chief Credit
Officer, Dan, not the magnitude of losses, but where would those losses come from the cycle? And I thought his
answer was insightful. He thought that 40% of it would probably be in the C&I portfolio. He thought that 40% of
whatever the potential losses would be would probably be in office, and then the other 20% would be in smaller
SBA and consumer kind of losses.
So interestingly, he saw no loss content or very little to no loss content in multifamily, retail or industrial. So I
thought that was an enlightening answer of kind of what his crystal ball was. But you can't judge the magnitude of
this right now, it doesn't look like there's much magnitude at all, but that's where he sees potential loss content.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. And just curious, what sort of assumptions was he making with those comments as far as kind of...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. That would be probably in a, I guess higher for longer means basically static kind of rate curve. And if,
Brandon, it's the five-year Treasury and it's kind of assuming the five-year Treasury stays in that 5% or less
range. If the five-year Treasury moves to 6%, 7%, I think the industry's headed for more noticeable losses across
the board, particularly CRE.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Operator: And we will take our next question from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the fee income side of things, particularly in mortgage
and correspondent banking, given that you were at the top end of the range of this quarter, what are you seeing in
terms of maybe early second quarter activity in both areas? And is the correspondent piece, is the push out of
lower rates or is that just keep the variation margin interest piece higher a little bit deeper into the year? Is that the
biggest delta in terms of that line item?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Gary, that's right. I think as we think about correspondent, we're sort of near the bottom on sort of the gross
income. We think somewhere that $14 million to $18 million range over the next few quarters. But you're right,
with the move up in long-term interest rate, the variation margin gets to be a little higher. So that moves – move
that I'll call it contra income account up a few million dollars a quarter. So, and then we think – as we think about
mortgage, the second quarter should be a good quarter, but it's a little too early to tell. We definitely did have a
spike up the first quarter. So, as we think about the entire picture and think about where non-interest income to
average assets we just really think with all the things we're looking at today, we think it's probably in that 55 basis
points to 60 basis point range until we get some footing on the – on whether we get rate cuts or when do we get.
The fixed income business, of course, right now with higher rates is a much challenging business. And as we
move our SBA team up in Houston that we just recruited over, that'll help that. But it takes a few quarters to get
that up and move and but that really mostly a 2025 event.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one question on the construction piece. Obviously, not much in the way of
new commitments, I'd assume, in that business right now, hence, the kind of rolling over of the period end
balances. How much kind of planned exits are there in the construction side as you look over the remainder of the
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. You're right, Gary. I think our construction development portfolio decreased significantly down by like $500
million roughly in the quarter. And that was some of these projects just coming to completion. But, Will as the
unfunded piece of that's left to construction, do you have that number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. Let's see. Unfunded piece is around $2 billion. And the biggest piece of that would be most down to the
largest property type within that. And then the second would be the owner constructed single-family residential.
So a loan to Gary Tenner to bill his custom house where he's the borrower, not the builder. That'll be the second
biggest. I'm going to just kind of bunch of different categories [indiscernible] (00:38:11)

John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
But the ratio of construction to capital, Gary dropped pretty significantly during the quarter below 50%. And we
really don't see in the near-term that moving up. Even with some of those fundings. We sort of think there's
payoffs along the way and it kind of drifts sideways roughly from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, SouthState Corp.
Yeah. We've not been refilling that bucket. And that's why you've seen that number come down. It has the last
couple of quarters as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments supporting as well as those amounts come
down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. But you're saying it sounds like you're saying that funding of existing commitments sort of offsets exits for
the remainder of the year...

John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, SouthState Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Good morning. A quick question during the preamble, I think it was well noted. Maybe the loan repricing on
the fixed rate side could provide a tailwind. Just remind us what the – I guess the dollar volume of repricing looks
like over the next few quarters and what they might be pricing to and from? Thanks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2024
Yeah. This is Steve. When we think about loan repricing basically it's rough numbers of $1 billion a quarter. I think
we have about $3.3 billion left in 2024 and it's repricing in that – it's [ph] 4.67% (00:39:51) coupon. So, our
average loan yield this quarter was around 7.5%. So, it's not quite 300 basis points, but somewhere in that
general range. Next year, we have about $3.5 billion, at a [ph] 4.93% (00:40:06) coupon repricing in 2025. So it's,
you kind of look at it over the next seven or so quarters, it's roughly $7 billion. If you add another $1 billion or so in
securities repricing over the next seven quarters or so, that's kind of how to think about the next – to get to the
end of 2025.
And so, one of the questions, I think, it seems like sentiment has changed the higher for longer. And what I
wanted to do maybe before we close is just to think about a little bit around when rate cuts do happen and we
don't know when they're going to happen. But sort of the pluses and minuses in our book, the way we're thinking
about it and how we're sort of guiding in that 3 basis point to 5 basis point margin expansion when that happens.
And it has to really do with our loan construct. We have about $10 billion of floating rate loans. And if we get six
rate cuts, that'll cost us $150 million. We also have a $37 billion deposit portfolio. We're sort of modeling a 20%
down beta, 33% on the way up, 20% on the way down. So that would help us by $110 million or so if we get to the
end of next year, we have six rate cuts.
But really the thing left that really sort of propels everything is the $8 billion or so we just talked about that reprices
somewhere in that 2% to 3% range above where we are today. So let's call it 2%, that's $160 million. So you lose
$150 million on the floating, you gain $110 million on the deposits, and then you gain another $160 million on the
fixed rate repricing. That's $120 million or so on a run rate; on $40 billion, that's about a 30 basis point
improvement. And that's sort of how we unpack the 3 basis point to 5 basis point as we think about rate cuts. So I
know everybody right now is thinking that we're going to be higher for longer. And certainly that's what the data
telling us. But to the extent the Fed does pivot at some point, that's how we're thinking about sort of rates now.

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Appreciate that. That's great color. And then final question, I noticed just – maybe a housekeeping, a little bit of a
tick up in short-term cash and liquidity. Did that have anything to do with the seasonality mentioned? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, SouthState Corp.
Not really. Probably just an end of the quarter type of event. Sometimes it moves around a little bit, but typically,
we're trying to manage the cash book at somewhere around 2.5% to 2% to 3% of assets. So sometimes it moves
a little higher, sometimes a little lower. But that's generally how we do it.
