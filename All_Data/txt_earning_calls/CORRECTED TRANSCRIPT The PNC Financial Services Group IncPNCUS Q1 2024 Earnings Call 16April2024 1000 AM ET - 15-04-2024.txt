Bryan K. Gill
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, good morning and welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I'm Bryan Gill,
the Director of Investor Relations for PNC. And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and CEO, Bill
Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor
Relations. These statements speak only as of April 16, 2024 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thank you, Bryan; and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we executed well and delivered solid financial
results. We generated $1.3 billion in net income and adjusting for the FDIC special assessment $3.36 per share.
Rob will provide details on our results in a moment, but I'll start with a few thoughts.
First, we continued to grow our business. In the first quarter, we added new customers across our segments and
increased deposits on a spot basis. We're continuing to invest heavily in our franchise to drive growth and gain
share, particularly in our Retail Banking technology platform or payments businesses and our expansion markets.
To that end, in the first quarter, we announced a multiyear investment of nearly $1 billion in our branch network to
renovate more than 1,200 locations and open new branches in key locations, including Austin, Dallas, Denver,
Houston, Miami and San Antonio.
Second, expenses were well-managed during the quarter. As we've indicated, expense discipline remains a top
priority, and we are on track to maintain stable core expenses in 2024.
Third, credit quality remained stable during the quarter. The office portfolio remains an area of focus, but we are
adequately reserved overall and particularly with respect to CRE. We believe our thoughtful approach to
managing risk, customer selection and long-term relationship development will continue to serve us well.
And fourth, we continued to build on our strong liquidity and capital position during the quarter, providing us with
the financial strength and flexibility to help us support our clients, grow our businesses and capitalize on future
opportunities.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
In summary, we delivered solid results during the first quarter and positioned ourselves well for the balance of
2024 and beyond. Last month, we launched a brand campaign celebrating our Boring approach to banking. Now,
obviously, we're using humor in the campaign to have a little fun and grab the public's attention. But inside of that
humor is honesty about who we are, how we think about risk and how we run our company. In short, it is
everything we do to be steady and predictable.
Finally, I just want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers, for each other and for all of
our stakeholders.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through the quarter. Rob?

Robert Q. Reilly
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill; and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide four and it's presented on an average
linked quarter basis.
Loans of $321 billion decreased $4 billion or 1%. Investment securities declined $2 billion or 1%. And our cash
balances at the Federal Reserve were $48 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 13%. On a spot basis, our cash at
the Fed was $53 billion, up from $43 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting higher period-end deposits.
Deposit balances averaged $420 billion, a decline of $4 billion or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower commercial
deposits. However, on a spot basis, deposits were up $4 billion, reflecting growth in both commercial and
consumer deposits. Borrowed funds increased $3 billion to $76 billion, primarily driven by parent company debt
issuances early in the quarter. At quarter-end, AOCI was a negative $8 billion compared to a negative $7.7 billion
at December 31, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, Our tangible book value increased to $85.70 per
common share, an 11% increase compared to the same period a year ago.
We remain well-capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.1% as of March 31. While we recognize the
likelihood of potentially substantial changes to the Basel III Endgame NPR, under the currently proposed capital
rules, our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 8.3% as of March
31, 2024.
We continue to be well-positioned with capital flexibility. Share repurchases approximated $135 million, or roughly
1 million shares; and when combined with $624 million of common dividends, we returned $759 million of capital
to shareholders during the quarter.
Slide 5 shows our loans in more detail. Compared to the fourth quarter, average loan balances decreased 1%
primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances. Commercial loans were $219 billion, a decrease of $3.4
billion, driven by lower utilization as well as soft loan demand. Within the Corporate & Institutional Bank, utilization
rates have remained below 2023 year-end levels and have not increased in the first quarter as is historically
typical. We expect utilization to increase throughout the year. Notably, each percent of utilization within C&IB
equates to $4 billion of loan growth. Consumer loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by lower credit
card and home equity balances. And total loan yields increased 7 basis points to 6.01% in the first quarter.
Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $135 billion
decreased 1% as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio pay-downs and maturity. The
securities portfolio yield increased 3 basis points to 2.62%, reflecting the runoff of lower yielding securities. As of
March 31, the securities portfolio duration was four years.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
Our receive-fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled $37 billion on March 31. The weighted
average receive-fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 20 basis points to 2.3% and the duration of the portfolio
was two years. Through the end of 2024, 13% of our securities and swap portfolio is scheduled to mature, which
will allow us to reinvest into higher yielding assets, providing a meaningful benefit to net interest income in the
second half of the year. Accumulated other comprehensive income was negative $8 billion at March 31, which will
accrete back as our securities and swaps mature, resulting in continued tangible book value growth.
Slide 7 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $4 billion to $420 billion during the
quarter, as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by a seasonal decline in commercial deposits.
Regarding mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 24% in the first quarter, down slightly from 25% in
the fourth quarter. Notably, on a spot basis, in the first quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits had the smallest
dollar decline since the Fed began raising rates in 2022, which gives us confidence that the noninterest-bearing
portion of our deposits has largely stabilized.
Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.6% during the first quarter, up from 2.48% in the prior
quarter. And as of March 31, our cumulative deposit beta was 45% and consistent with our expectations. We
believe our deposit betas have approached their peak levels, although we do expect some potential drift higher
through the period leading up to a Fed rate cut, which we currently expect to occur in July.
In regard to the timing and amount of potential rate cuts, we recognize there's a lot of fluidity and uncertainty.
However, our 2024 NII will largely be unaffected by any short-term interest rate movement or lack thereof. This is
because our floating rate assets are aligned with our floating rate liabilities, including our high beta commercial
interest-bearing deposits, and our long-term debt, which is almost entirely swapped to floating rates. Importantly,
going forward, we remain well-positioned for the NII benefit of repricing low yielding fixed rate securities and loans
maturing during the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.
Turning to the income statement on slide 8. First quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $3.10 per share, which
included a pre-tax non-core noninterest expense of $130 million, or $103 million after-tax, related to the increased
FDIC special assessment. Excluding non-core expenses, adjusted EPS was $3.36 per share.
Total revenue of $5.1 billion decreased $216 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Net interest
income declined by $139 million or 4%. And our net interest margin was 2.57%, a decline of 9 basis points,
resulting primarily from higher funding costs. Noninterest income decreased $77 million or 4%. Noninterest
expense of $3.3 billion declined $740 million or 18% and included $130 million FDIC special assessment.
Importantly, core noninterest expense was $3.2 billion and decreased $205 million or 6%. Provision was $155
million in the first quarter, reflecting portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors. And our effective tax
rate was 18.8%.
Turning to slide 9, we highlight our revenue trends. First quarter revenue was down $216 million or 4%, driven by
lower net interest income and in part a seasonal decline in fee income. Net interest income of $3.3 billion declined
$139 million or 4%, reflecting increased funding costs, lower loan balances and one less day in the quarter. Fee
income was $1.7 billion and decreased $74 million or 4% linked quarter.
Looking at the detail, asset management and brokerage revenue was up $4 million or 1%, reflecting higher
average equity markets. Capital markets and advisory fees declined $50 million or 16%, driven by lower M&A
advisory activity, off elevated fourth quarter levels, partially offset by higher underwriting fees. Card and cash
management decreased $17 million or 2%, driven by seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes, partially

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
offset by higher treasury management fees. Lending and deposit-related fees declined $9 million or 3%, reflecting
the reduction of customer fees on certain checking products. Residential and commercial mortgage revenue
declined $2 million or 1% and included lower residential mortgage activity. Other noninterest income of $135
million decreased $3 million or 2%, reflecting lower gains on sales. The first quarter also included a negative $7
million Visa fair value adjustment compared to a negative $100 million adjustment in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 10. Our core noninterest expense of $3.2 billion decreased $205 million or 6% linked quarter,
reflecting strong expense management. Importantly, compared to the first quarter of 2023, core noninterest
expense declined $117 million or 4%, with a decline in every expense category. This broad-based result reflects
the impact of expense actions taken in 2023.
As we've previously stated, we implemented expense management actions that will drive $750 million of cost
savings in 2024. These actions include the $325 million workforce reduction effort last year, which was realized in
our first quarter expense run rate, and our $425 million 2024 Continuous Improvement Program goal, which we're
well on track to achieve. We remain diligent in our expense management efforts, and these actions give us
confidence that we'll keep our year-over-year expenses stable.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 11. While overall credit quality remains resilient, the pressure we
anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector has continued. Non-performing loans increased $200
million or 9% linked quarter, almost entirely driven by commercial real estate, which increased $188 million. And
inside of that, approximately $150 million was related to the CRE office portfolio.
Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million or 8% linked quarter, driven by lower consumer and
commercial delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs were $243 million in the first quarter, and our annualized net
charge-off to average loans ratio was 30 basis points. Our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7%
of total loans on March 31, stable with December 31.
Slide 12 provides more detail on our CRE office credit metrics. While NPLs have increased over the past few
quarters, our criticized balances have remained relatively consistent. The migration of criticized loans to non-
performing status is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to
this portfolio. In the first quarter, net loan charge-offs within the CRE office portfolio were $50 million, essentially in
line with the previous quarter level.
Ultimately, we expect continued charge-offs on this portfolio. And accordingly, we believe we are adequately
reserved. As of March 31, our reserves on the office portfolio were 9.7% of total office loans; and inside of that,
14.4% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Importantly, we continue to manage our exposure down and, as a result, our
balances declined 3% or approximately $200 million linked quarter.
In summary, PNC reported a solid first quarter 2024 and we're well-positioned for the remainder of the year.
Regarding our view of the overall economy, we're expecting economic expansion in the second half of the year,
resulting in real GDP growth of approximately 2% in 2024 and unemployment to increase modestly to 4% by year-
end. We expect the Fed to cut rates two times in 2024 with a 25 basis point decrease in July and another in
November.
Looking at the second quarter of 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2024, we expect average loans to be
stable, net interest income to be down approximately 1% and, as I mentioned previously, we expect NII and net
6

interest margin to trough in the second quarter, fee income to be up 1% to 2%, other noninterest income to be in
the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding Visa activity.
Taking the component pieces of revenue together, we expect total revenue to be stable. We expect total core
noninterest expense to be up 2% to 4%. We expect second quarter net charge-offs to be between $225 million
and $275 million. As a reminder, PNC owns 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of
approximately $1.6 billion. Under the terms of Visa's current exchange program scheduled to close on or about
May 3, Class B shareholders will have the opportunity to monetize 50% of their holdings. We've not included the
impact of monetizing the Visa gain in our forecast.
Turning to slide 14. Our full year 2024 guidance is unchanged from our January earnings call. And as a reminder,
for the full year 2024 compared to the full year 2023, we expect average loan growth of approximately 1%, total
revenue to be stable to down 2%. Inside of that, our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range
of 4% to 5% and noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%. Core noninterest expense, which excludes the FDIC
assessment, is expected to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Yeah. No, this is great. The first question just has to do with how you're thinking about the NII indicating 2Q the
trough, improving from there, and I would think that the majority of that improvement is coming from loan growth,
but correct me if I am wrong. How are you thinking about that NII trajectory into the second half of the year? And
then – well, I'll start there.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Okay. Good morning, Betsy. This is Rob. So, in terms of NII and the trajectory that we're on, we knew at the
beginning of the year that we would trough around this time in the second quarter. And that's what's happening.
We expect to grow from that trough level based on the repricing of our fixed rate assets as rates settle down.
There is some reliance on the back half for loan growth, but all consistent with our full year guidance. Average
loans up 1%.

You go ahead, Bill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I was just going to say that the largest driver is repricing of fixed rate assets. We expect some loan growth, but it's
not a heroic number in there. It's simply the roll out of our securities book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. Yeah. All right. And on the loan side, it is interesting to see the utilization rates ticking down here. Do
you think that's just a function of Fed funds 5.5% and that's the base rate from which C&I is priced off of or is
there other dynamics there besides just rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a variety of things. I think the capital markets activity in the first quarter and investment-grade debt put a lot of
cash into the system and you saw companies that could hit that market pay down the revolver. So that was sort of
a near-term impact to it. As we look out, there hasn't been any real inventory build, which I would expect, given
retail sales. There hasn't been much CapEx, and capacity utilization has been holding constant at a pretty high
level. So, at some point, this needs to turn, but I think the first quarter kind of surprised us. And my best guess
was that was on the back of just how liquid the public markets were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it, Bill.

Hi John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the expense front, looks like within expenses, they came in a bit better than expected maybe on the comp side
and certain other areas. And you cited the solid expense management and your cost save efforts. Would you say
that the trends are coming in perhaps a bit better than you had forecasted as you look at your expense phase?
And is there any thought process that potentially your full year 2024 outlook could prove conservative in terms of
your stable expectations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
John, this is Rob. So I'd say, for the full year, we're still planning and guiding towards stable. In the first quarter,
you're right, we're off to a good start in terms of realizing the expense actions that we took last year and the CIP
program that we have this year. But it's a little early in the year to roll that all forward. And like I said, we're off to a
good start, and we're well-positioned for stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, Rob. That's helpful. And then just separately, on the credit side, you could see the commercial real
estate stress that you mentioned and you prudently added to the office reserve in the quarter, but relatively stable
or down a little bit in terms of your firm-wide reserve. Could you maybe talk about the progression in credit and
other areas? Are you seeing any mounting stress at all in C&I that could potentially keep the reserve currently
stable or could you continue to from a firm-wide perspective bleed the reserve here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Bleed is a bad word. The credit action at the moment is in the real estate book and specifically inside of office,
consumer at the margin a little bit worse. But there isn't anything systematic going on in C&I that would cause us
to have any different expectations of what we see now and we're reserved for the moment based on our
economic forecast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The pressure is in the CRE book, specifically the office book.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Looking at slide 6 here where you show the runoff of the fixed rate securities and swaps and any
way to size the revenue pickup from this, either anchoring to the forward curve or current rates? We put out some
crude analysis that showed about a $2 billion impact and just said it was linear, so half this year, half next. But
obviously, it's rough cut at it. So I don't know if you have any comments on that or frame it on using your
estimates. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I would say – so, we laid it out in the slides in terms of what we see in terms of runoff. And obviously, the
projected AOCI burn down as it relates to capital. But all of that's in our guide. So, in terms of what our
expectations are in terms of that behavior, that's in our full year NII guide, which is down 4% to 5%. But just to
make the point in terms of what we were saying earlier, go forward, the biggest variable is the repricing of our
fixed rate assets and in this case securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Matt, I think what everybody's struggling with here is this notion of what's the Fed going to do in the next period of
time? Is it new cuts or no cuts or three cuts, remember we started out with six cuts.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2024
Yeah. We did not, but the market did. We know based on forward curve, the repricing of our fixed rate assets, the
amount of money – incremental money we will earn from that has increased because term rates have increased.
At the same time, the assumption that the Fed will maintain rates here longer causes us to pause on what
happens to deposit pricing through time, right. So, there's a trade-off. Higher rates in the long run, obviously, help
us on our fixed rate assets. Deposit repricing continues on if the Fed holds longer, a much slower pace than it's
been in the past, but I think it would be a bit of a heroic assumption for anybody to say that deposit costs won't
continue to creep up in the face of a steady Fed. And so, that's the trade-off in the near term. Longer term, the
repricing of the fixed rate assets dwarfs the repricing of deposits. And that's kind of why we say look in the second
quarter, we trough and then we pick up from there.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That makes sense. And then sorry if I missed it earlier, but did you reiterate your view that 2025 net interest
income would be record level? And if you did, what would derail that? The higher for longest doesn't sound like
that will change it. Is there still a loan growth component or if rates go down too much? Just what would be the
risk of achieving that if you still have that view? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, the biggest risk would a massive curve inversion, such that we were repricing fixed rate securities at
lower yields at...

Well, I mean, than what they were three months ago. Our original assumptions in that forecast yields were [ph]
100 bps (00:28:39) lower than they are right now. If they were to fall well below that, we would be at risk at that

Rob, you talked about the utilization of the C&I loans that it was lower in the first quarter and normally it kind of
ticks up a bit. Question on that. Do you think your customers are just uncertain about their outlooks, which is kind
of held them back from drawing down on lines of credit? Or do you think that they're having access to other
lenders, meaning private credit market or the public markets that has taken away opportunities for banks to have
these companies increase those lines of utilization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

I think it's both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The capital markets activity in the first quarter, the private credit side on leveraged finance doesn't really
impact us. But the public markets were wide open. By the way, our fees were up in that space for serving clients
that way. But naturally, at the margin, that causes our utilization to go down. The other issue, you can't ignore,
right, but we've seen capital spend and inventory build be next to nothing, even though capacity utilization is high,
retail sales are high. And at some point, that's got to give. But I do think there continues to be hesitancy on
manufacturers in particular just in the face of this economy, and I think that's part of it.

Very good. And then I know, Rob, I think you touched on in an answer to a question about the commercial real
estate outlook, office in particular. And you guys everything appears to be going in your expectations, what kind of
pricing declines – in appraisals that have come up and where you've had to reappraise certain properties, are you
seeing price declines 10%, 15%, 20% on those appraisals or more? Any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, much higher than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Variance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The variance is all over the place. But as a practical matter, if we were underwritten at the start at $0.50 to $0.55
on whatever the appraised value was at that point in time, a big chunk of the book right now is effectively at par.
When we look at resolutions that we've gone through, we've had everything from we get out hold till we lose $0.75
on the dollar on a given loan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's the variance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, it's building-specific, it's market-specific that's driving this, but loss rates are a lot higher. If you looked
at office and said, hey, how much value has fallen? It's a lot higher than 15%. Personally across the spaces, in my
view, is closer to 30% or 40% or even higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And you're thinking ahead in terms of where we're going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

Well, it's not showing up in appraisals here. We're just seeing it in actual resolution of properties.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey good morning, guys. Just back on the NII guide. You mentioned the largest driver of the growth you're
looking for in the back half of the year is coming from the repricing. Then you got the loan growth as another
factor. Was just wondering what you're assuming for deposit flows within that as well. I would assume that those
could be a little bit better just from a seasonal perspective in the back half of the year. And then on the securities
rolling off, how much of that liquidity is getting plowed back into the securities book? And what kind of yields
you're looking at there at this point on purchases?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So I'll let Rob hit deposits in a second. The assumption – I mean, we have roll-off of both fixed rate loans and
fixed rate securities. And the yields we assume in our forecast at this point are just forward curve adjusted for
whatever the right spread is of the asset we're replacing, so like-for-like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And then just on the deposits, back at the beginning of the year, we expected deposits to decline year-
over-year low-single-digits. We still expect that; albeit in the first quarter, we did outperform that a bit, but our
expectations are for slightly lower deposits through the balance of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And then on the loan growth outlook, which you talked about, I guess, on an end-of-period basis last
quarter. Does higher for longer impact that expectation at all? And what's your outlook for the longer end of the
curve through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. I don't know that I thought much about how higher for longer impacts loan growth or not. The outlook that we
have for rates at this point, our official outlook is we have, what do we say, two cuts starting in July at this point
with the curve largely staying where it is.
Our forecast, whether we're using current forward curve or even when rates were lower, our NII forecast isn't
terribly sensitive to what we're assuming at least for this year because the incremental amount we make from
higher yields on bonds and loans repricing, we're assuming is largely offset on the deposit costs, the leakage that
occurs if the Fed doesn't cut rates. So, we're not making heroic assumptions on rates. We don't really care where
they go in the near term. What we know is once we get through the second quarter here that the repricing of fixed
rate assets simply starts to dwarf the potential repricing on deposits independent on where rates are.

Please proceed with your questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess, maybe the tenth question on your loan growth outlook for the back half. I think I guess the
macro concern is that higher for longer will eventually tip this economy into a recession. Would love to hear Bill,
Rob, your perspective based on what you are hearing from your bankers' clients. If we don't get any rate cuts for
the year, based on what you're seeing, like, could we have a blind spot where the economy really kind of tails off
where a lot of these things catch up, we enter some version of a [ph] stagflation (00:36:32), just how do you
handicap that downside risk heading into the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, I think that's a possibility. One of the peculiar things about utilization is when credit conditions tighten,
utilization increases. It's actually one of the primary drivers of utilization. So bizarrely, loan growth would increase
if you ran – because utilization would increase if you ran into that scenario. But I do worry about that. Look,
eventually, if the only way to get rid of inflation is to really hurt the economy. I worry less about loan growth and
more about long-term credit losses for the whole industry just as right now everybody is planning for a soft
landing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And you still think soft landing is base case in terms of most likely outcome right now?

Of deal-making picking up ahead of the November elections?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, the letter was self-explanatory. And we've kind of beaten the topic to death. I guess, what I would suggest
is, I think the banking industry, by and large, is set up to do well over the next 18 months or so, simply through
rates normalizing, assuming you didn't have big concentrations to real estate in office. And I think everybody in
the near term is focused on that. I think long term, some of the charts we've put in that letter, it's just hard to
ignore. You see the two largest banks in the country who in the last four years grew of size larger than Truist, U.S.
Bank and PNC put together. I don't know what the regulators think or don't think about that. The intent of the letter
was to just point out that if what they wrote in the OCC comment letter was to freeze M&A across the country for
any bank over $50 billion, I think you can see the outcome that we'll have in this country, which is a massive
consolidation with the giant national banks. It's all my point was.

No. I think most banks tend to hang out the next 18 months because their earnings are going to improve and their
internal forecasts are going to look good and everything's rosy. I worry about the out-years. But in the near term, I
imagine everybody's internal look looks pretty good.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your comments around soft loan demand and utilization
rates, assuming we avoid recession and the soft landing scenario plays out, how would you respond to the view
that the ingredients may not be in place for a reacceleration in loan growth, given this environment where Fed
funds is running above CPI and the Fed can't cut amid sticky inflation? We spent most of the post-GFC era with
Fed funds running below CPI and had mid-single-digit loan growth. But would just love your thoughts on the risk
that loan growth may not go up much if the Fed can't cut below CPI. And do you lean more heavily into your fee-
based businesses if that happens?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I'm not sure Fed funds versus CPI necessarily has much to do with loan growth. I think loan growth ultimately is
driven by the economy and the economy has been running hotter than most people had assumed and it's been
running hotter than most people had assumed without big inventory builds. If you look at fourth quarter GDP,
there was a drawdown on inventories. Inventories are directly correlated with the utilization of loan growth. And
CapEx has been muted. So, if the economy slows, if the Fed has to slow the economy to a point where it's not a
soft landing in order to get inflation under control, that can hurt loan growth. But if the economy is strong, you just
saw retail sales, eventually it's going to translate into loan growth independent of whether or not there's positive
real rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a strong correlation there.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the fee side. I think when you spoke in January, you talked about
expected slowness in capital markets and M&A to begin the year. And then I think you were thinking about a 20%
growth overall. Just wondering just how that's looking in terms of the body language you're getting from those
middle market clients in Harris Williams? And then also, if you have any other color on what you think the other
drivers of fees are going to be? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, the Harris Williams pipeline at the moment is larger, larger than it's ever been, but it's larger than it was
last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Just their first quarter relative to their fourth quarter is light and that's what drove the quarter-on-quarter change in
our total fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, Ken, to answer your question, we are sticking to the 20% expectation for growth in capital markets
year-over-year. Bill's right. First quarter was off elevated fourth quarter levels. But in terms of the comp last year in
the second and third quarter, capital markets was really soft. Harris Williams is really soft and the pipeline
suggests we are not going to repeat. That will be well above those levels.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. All right. And last one just on the asset and wealth side, I think you've had some pretty good flows
and things like that first quarter starting point was more of the markets. I know you put a lot of effort into that
business. Any sense of just change in terms of like asset flows and new business wins and incremental potential
revenue growth out of that business specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We have had success over the last year kind of repositioning who and what we are in the market, bringing in new
assets. To accelerate that to a level where it becomes a meaningful part of our company I think is a bit of a
challenge. It's a service to our clients and we're good at it. But the trends are going the right way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I would just add to that, Ken. Obviously, the business is doing well with the equity markets supporting that.
The growth opportunity is in the new BBVA markets in the Southwest where, you'll recall, BBVA really didn't have
a wealth management business. So, we're de novo, so to speak, in all those markets. But we're up and running
with teams. Asset inflows are occurring. And long term, that's where the incremental growth will come from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And one more just to follow up. Is that an area that you could add to inorganically over time? I know it's tough just
because of multiples and whatnot, but you've done it organically, as you just said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's a tough business, in my view, to add to inorganically. Cultural difference is the way you go to market. The
outright price and the goodwill associated with the return on equity that comes with that makes it all really difficult
to do. And at least historically, the opportunity to grow organically is much stronger than going out and trying to
add to it through purchase.

mentioned $1 billion of extra spending for branches. How much of that was in the first quarter and how should we

think about those offsets? And I know it's a tough fight to get positive operating leverage this year. Do you feel
better or worse or the same as you did three months ago? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, let me chunk that down. So, we'll start with the positive operating leverage for the full year. We still think
that's pretty tough not including any Visa gains, of course, simply because of the NII and the rate issues and
those run rates. We do feel good about our expenses. We've projected and guided to being stable year-over-year.
We're off to a good start in the first quarter, a little bit ahead of where we expected to be, but we still got a long
way to go. So, all of the items that you talked about, they're in there, but the guidance is stable over year-over-
year, which is important to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I'll shift gears back. Bill, you were talking about commercial real estate, look, you reserved 10% for office.
And you said the value of the underlying properties are probably down 30% to 40% or more. So, I guess, that is
reflected in your reserving, which I think is more than the average bank. Do you see a difference by – and I know
it changes by region and sub-region and property and type and all that. But do you see a difference by region,
whether it's the big cities? Give a little sense of that variance you said it's all over the place. Can you just fill out a
few data points around that, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No surprise. Parts of California are the worst. But it really comes down to the building and the market. I
mean, you could have a building that's in the right place in Pittsburgh and it's doing absolutely fine and you could
have a building that's in the wrong place in Pittsburgh and it's literally worth zero. And that's the market we're
playing with right now. Now inside of that whole thing, we do feel that we've been ahead of this game, that we're
reserved correctly, that we are conservatively taking marks and we have the opportunity to do so. But this is going
to play out over time, and your eyes aren't lying to you when you look out and see vacancies. And I think
ourselves and the large banks have been pretty open about it's going to be an issue. It's not a massive book of
business for us. I'm not particularly worried about it. We're well-reserved. But it's going to roll through the country
and impact some of the smaller banks I think in a way that is probably larger than people...

With the margin, yes, but it is kind of just at the margin. So you see debt service coverage ratios decline as
interest costs take more of the cash flow out and in multifamily, for example, rents aren't increasing at the pace
they once were. The massive difference, though, Mike, is that all other types or virtually all other types of real
estate are cash flowing. So there's a value to them, right. They just might not cash flow to support the original
amount of debt they had. The problem you have in office is, in many instances, there's no cash flow at all. It's
really a unique animal at the moment.

Hey guys. Just wanted to just touch base on how you're thinking about capital build. Obviously, you're building
organically. You've got some Visa that will add 14 bps, 15 bps next quarter, I guess. Are you just kind of thinking
of gradually kind of building from this 10% reported and the 8.3% fully loaded to get to 9% or 10% or so over the
next year, do a little bit of buybacks? Just kind of what's the plan there?

When you think about it, inside, we have always moving pieces. So inside of the NPR Basel III Endgame, the one
thing – it's all up in the air, but the one thing that you got to believe is going to stick is AOCI. And so, if that's the
case, then our printed A3 number is kind of our real number, and that would be otherwise too low for us if we want
to build that through time. Some of that will happen just from the rundown of the book and some of that will
happen through us building capital. The ultimate where should we be Basel III Endgame everything settled out
number, I don't know that we've necessarily set yet, other than it's higher than where we sit today on the A3.
