Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone. Old National announced several strategic actions today including a
new strategic plan, the consolidation of 31 or 16% of our branches across our footprint and two capital actions,
including raising our dividend and authorizing a new share repurchase program.
As I've mentioned on prior calls, we spent the last year internally focused and I've challenged our executive team
to think about ways we can better serve our clients, our team members, our communities and importantly our
2

shareholders. This new strategic plan is called The ONB Way. I'll share more details later in my remarks. But
some of the initial charges related to implementation are included in our fourth quarter earnings.
Starting with slide 3. Our fourth quarter net income was $49.2 million, including $8.4 million in charges from the
ONB Way as well as merger charges. Adjusted net income was higher at $55.2 million. As you review our results,
you'll see that our core margin was stable despite the Fed fund rate cut in September and October and a
challenging yield curve. Credit quality remained strong. We recorded $1.3 million of provision on net charge-offs
of $3.6 million. The higher net charge-offs were primarily a result of a single credit that was previously reserved
for prior quarters. Non-accrual loans declined nicely in the quarter and year-over-year.
As I have said in prior quarters, while our credit quality is strong we're not immune from losses. We're still
watching a small number of credits, but I'm not losing sleep over credit today. We saw record commercial
production for the quarter and strong core deposit growth. Importantly, we also effectively managed our costs of
total deposits lower by 9 basis points to 43 basis points and we posted strong year-over-year operating leverage
and efficiency ratio improvements.
Next, on slide 4, full-year net income was $238 million, including $17.4 million in charges for the ONB Way and
merger charges. Adjusted net income was almost 24% higher year-over-year. Like the quarter, we saw record
commercial production for the year and our pipeline was a record setting $2.2 billion at yearend. We also
produced a record $1.4 billion in mortgage loans, of which approximately 62% was sold in the secondary market.
We posted strong year-over-year adjusted operating leverage improvements of 636 basis points and adjusted
efficiency ratio improvements of 369 basis points. Adjusted return on average assets was 1.25% and adjusted
return on tangible common equity was 15.7%. On the capital front, we repurchased 6 million shares during the
year at an average price of $16.58.
Moving to slide 5. Despite the repurchases, tangible book value per share grew by 15% year-over-year and
tangible common equity to assets stood at a strong 9.09% at year-end. As I said in the beginning of the call, we
announced two capital actions including a 7.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per share, which
represents an approximately 3% dividend yield. We also announced a new share repurchase program of 7 million
shares, which we expect to be opportunistic about over the next year.
A quick update on M&A. Our strategy hasn't changed. We remain an active looker and a selective buyer. We are
patient and continue to wait for the perfect pitch while remaining focused on execution. Given the importance of
the ONB Way, the hurdle will be even higher as we work on achieving our milestones and completing our
initiatives.
Next, Brendon is going to walk through this quarter's details.

Thank you, Jim. Turning to the quarter on slide 6, our GAAP earnings per share was $0.29 and our adjusted
earnings per share was $0.32. Adjusted earnings per share excludes $8.2 million in ONB Way related charges,
$250,000 in merger related charges as well as $400,000 in debt securities gains.
Moving to slide 7. Our quarterly adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue was 10% higher year-over-year and
up a notable 23% for the full year. This result was driven by increased scale from our recent Minnesota
partnership, our strong low-cost deposit base and a continued focus on expense management. We also improved
operating leverage by a strong 636 basis points year-over-year.

Slide 8 shows the trend in outstanding loans. As Jim referenced, our commercial loan production of $681 million
was the largest in our company's history. We ended the quarter with a record $2.2 billion pipeline, and good
momentum heading into 2020. Persistently high levels of prepayments has held commercial outstandings flat
despite our third consecutive quarter of record production.
As expected, September and October rate cuts drove loan portfolio yields, excluding accretion, down 14 basis
points in the fourth quarter. Production yields in the fourth quarter were 3.76% which reflects the lower long-term
rate environment that we expect will continue to put pressure on asset yields.
Moving to slide 9. Both period-end and average deposits increased during the quarter. Our total cost of deposits
declined 9 basis points quarter-over-quarter to a very low 43 basis points. We are pleased with the results of our
deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a meaningful reduction in deposit costs while simultaneously growing
our core deposit base. With a little over $1 billion in deposits indexed to fed funds and proactive management of
our exception price book, we are confident our ability to manage deposit costs lower in response to any future
Fed action.
Slide 10 shows our fourth quarter earning asset mix and quarter-over-quarter change in loan mix. Although, our
efforts have been impacted somewhat by prepayments, we remain focused on remixing the loan portfolio towards
more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans, and out of indirect and other loans. The
investment portfolio yield was down 8 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.74%, which was equal to the fourth
quarter yield on new purchases.
Next on slide 11, you'll see the detailed changes in our fourth quarter net interest income and corresponding
margin. We are pleased with the performance of our margin given the challenges of the interest rate environment.
Net interest margin excluding accretion was better than expected at 3.25% compared to 3.26% last quarter. The
anticipated decline in earning asset yields which were down 14 basis points was nearly offset by reductions in our
funding costs. Active repricing of our deposit book and strong non-interest bearing deposit growth help mitigate
the negative impact on asset yields that resulted from the recent Fed rate cuts. Our ongoing work to reposition the
balance sheet to a more neutral interest rate risk position along with continued thoughtful and disciplined
approach to deposit pricing should allow us to defend our margin well against the stubbornly flat yield curve.
Slide 12 shows trends in adjusted non-interest income. Our fourth quarter non-interest income decreased $6
million following a strong third quarter performance that included record capital markets revenue and $1.7 million
in annual vendor incentives. The quarter-over-quarter change was a result of a seasonal decline in mortgage
banking revenue and a return to trend line of our capital markets revenue. Also included on the slide is a
summary of our mortgage activity for the quarter which included a record $468 million in production. Low interest
rates continue to support strong refi activity which accounted for 54% of our production.
Next, slide 13 shows the trend in adjusted non-interest expenses which reflects our ongoing focus on expense
management. We did experience an uptick in adjusted expenses in Q4 driven by additional incentive
compensation accruals related to record loan production and our full year earnings performance. Our adjusted
efficiency ratio for the full year is a record low of 57.87% and represents a 369 basis point improvement over
2018. Expense discipline is an important part of our culture and despite the revenue headwinds impacting the
industry, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage.
Slide 14 has our credit metrics. Credit conditions remain benign as we experienced positive migration during the
quarter and both non-performing and underperforming loans fell to new cycle lows. We recorded $1.3 million in
4

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
provision expense during the fourth quarter while posting net charge-offs of $3.6 million. The increase in net
charge-offs was driven by a single credit that had been fully reserved for in prior quarters. Our higher level of non-
performing loans relative to peers reflects our practice of identifying credit challenges early. We believe early
recognition of underperforming credits and active engagement with borrowers ultimately leads to lower credit
losses as demonstrated by our below average charge-offs.
Slide 15 demonstrates our strong reserve coverage and low-risk balance sheet. With 56 basis points of reserves
against organic loans and 322 basis points in loan market against the acquired loans, we believe that we have
adequate reserve coverage. Before we turn away from credit, we want to provide you with an update on our
transition to CECL. Our estimated increased reallowance remained unchanged at $35 million to $45 million. A
large portion of the increase is related to the establishment of an allowance for $2.3 billion of acquired loans with
relatively modest increases in reserves on the remaining legacy book. The relatively wide range reflects the
uncertainty of future macroeconomic forecasts, but assuming economic conditions remain stable, we would
expect to be in the bottom half of this range.
Slide 16 provides some key takeaways from our fourth quarter performance. We are pleased with our results
driven by good execution against our strategic objectives. We successfully defended our core margin, which
showed only a 1 basis point decline for prior quarter. Commercial loan activity remained strong with three
consecutive quarters of record production and a record pipeline heading into 2020. The 636 basis point year-over-
year improvement in adjusted operating leverage and the 369 basis point improvement in our adjusted efficiency
ratio demonstrates the benefits of our increased scale and continued focus on expense management.
Slide 17 includes thoughts on fourth quarter starting points and our outlook for 2020. We expect commercial loan
production to remain strong based on both the size and quality of our pipeline. We expect core net interest margin
to be under some pressure from the shape of the yield curve. As the slide suggests, fees and expenses should
follow normal seasonal patterns and we remain very focused on continuing to drive positive operating leverage.
Our full year 2020 tax rate is expected to be approximately 18.5% on an FTE basis and 14.5% on a GAAP basis.
The effective tax rate includes an estimated $15 million in tax credits, primarily related to historic tax credit
projects expected to be completed this year. These projects are anticipated to generate an estimated $13 million
in tax credit amortization, which will flow through the operating expenses. Please include the $13 million in
operating expenses in your model along with a reduced effective tax rate. The after tax benefit of these projects is
estimated to be approximate $2 million in 2020. As a reminder, the tax credit amortization is recognized through
expenses in the quarter that corresponds with the place and service date, while the tax benefit is spread over the
full year through the tax line.
I will now turn the call back over to Jim Ryan to share some additional details on our ONB Way strategic plan.

Thanks Brendon. Turning to slide 18, I want to share some details on the ONB Way.
In May, we started with a performance improvement diagnostic to define our go-forward strategy and identify
revenue and efficiency opportunities across the bank. In August of 2019, we set out to build a bankable plan that
was to deliver three key objectives. First, transform Old National to a leading commercially oriented regional bank
with a distinctive client centric value proposition delivered through a client segment focused organization.
5


Old National Bancorp
(ONB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Secondly, lay the foundation to be a top performing independent bank by streamlining our operating model and
strengthening our risk and credit processes to provide a seamless client experience. Thirdly, improve our
operating leverage, invest in our operational IT infrastructure to meet our clients where they are and ensure that
we're keeping pace with technology and client digital expectation through a balanced portfolio of revenue and cost
initiatives, to help us deliver top quartile performance.
We have now entered the implementation phase to capture the value identified in the design phase. We have
over 800 milestones with 60 total initiatives. We anticipate the execution lasting one to two years. We've
communicated the impacts for the ONB Way changes to our team members last week including the 31 branch
consolidations. We plan to also hold an Investor Day on May 13 in Indianapolis to provide more details and share
updates on our progress.
Moving to slide 19, let me share our vision for the ONB Way. We'll be a leading commercially-oriented regional
bank with a distinctive client-centric value proposition based on strong relationships, a streamlined operating
model, an exceptional work environment that empowers our team members to deliver their best.
Moving to slide 20, let me share some key organizational structure changes for the ONB Way. Historically, Old
National has been organized by geography. That model served us well for 185 years, but as we've grown through
partnerships and our clients have become more diverse, we saw the need to move from a generalist to more
specialist relationship management approach to better serve our client needs. As a result, we're moving to three
main client segmentations.
The first is the Commercial segment, which includes segments based on clients revenue size and approved
treasury and management offering and some dedicated units for specialized lending in select industry verticals.
This segment is being led by one of our most successful commercial leaders, Dennis Heishman, who started our
Louisville, Kentucky office more than 10 years ago. Dennis will lead this segment from Louisville. A key new hire
reporting to Dennis is Malinda Anthony who recently joined us from Wells Fargo to lead our Treasury
Management team. She leads the TM team from Indianapolis.
The second segment is Community Banking that will provide products and services tailored to each market,
serving personal, small business clients through a full range of distribution channels to meet clients where they
are. This segment is being led by Todd Clark who was the President of United Bank & Trust and was most
recently our CIO. Todd will lead this segment from Michigan.
We're creating a new Wealth group for the third segment that combines our existing wealth management trust
businesses, our investment group and our private banking teams for a simplified private banker-led approach with
an emphasis on financial planning. This new Wealth segment will be led by Chady AlAhmar who will join Old
National later this month from U.S. Bank. He will be leading this segment from Minneapolis. I also want to note
that Daryl Moore will continue to lead our credit risk functions and continue to partner with our new segment
leaders.
Our main support areas including risk management, operations, finance and IT functions will align with these
client segments. This approach will align complexity with the amount of risk taken in each of our segments leading
to an overall better client experience, improved cycle times and enhanced efficiencies.
We also announced today the hiring of Paul Kilroy to be our new CIO joining us from Huntington Bank [Huntington
National Bank] and Scott Fecteau to lead our operations who most recently worked at Accenture. Please refer to
our press release for more information about these key hires.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
On slide 21, we provided some insights into the major initiatives of the ONB Way. The expense savings will
generate near-term benefits. But I'm more excited about the potential for the longer term revenue enhancements.
It will take most of 2020 to implement the revenue initiatives, so we will not see any benefits this year. We have
initiatives in all three client segments. We expect required investments in technology and talent to generate the
anticipated revenue enhancements and we'll provide more details as the initiatives more fully materialize.
Moving to slide 22, we outline the timing of the real estate, severance and professional one-time charges related
to the expense savings initiatives. The expense savings represent the net of any ongoing investments required to
implement. We expect total charges of $53 million which we've already taken $11 million in 2019, mostly related
to professional fees. The remaining $42 million we expect to take this year with the bulk coming in the first
quarter. Not including any benefits from the revenue initiatives, the charges are earned back in approximately one
and a half years.
By the end of 2020, we should be at a run rate of $36 million annually, but we expect the 2021 impact to be $40
million-plus as we implement additional longer term opportunities in 2021 that are dependent on technology
deployments.
Thank you for allowing us extra time this quarter to provide The ONB Way strategy update and the whole team is
available to take some questions. Thank you.

Good, good. Just want to make sure I understand the expense opportunities on slide 22. And Jim I think you said
this, but I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear. All the, if we look at the walk the $5 million, $7 million, $9 million
throughout 2020 and then the $40 million in full year 2021 benefits, those are all expenses which are net of
revenue opportunities, right. So that's all in other words anticipated to drop to the bottom line. Is that the right way
of looking at it?

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yes. They're all expense savings opportunities which include any required investment to achieve those expense
saving opportunities. We haven't included any revenue synergies this year primarily because they'll be de minimis
this year but we expect the impact to really start achieving that in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. So, all right, that's good news. And then maybe just a separate question on sort of run
rate stuff. So the margin on a core basis came in better than I would have thought this quarter. I know you
mentioned in your prepared remarks or Brendon did, the shape of the yield curve being the fact that it would
cause further compression. But I guess I'm just thinking given that the compression wasn't as bad as appeared in
the fourth quarter, what the main puts and takes would really be as you look out going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I'll maybe give you a high level overview and let Brendon comment where I don't get it exactly right. I mean
given the shape of the yield curve, loan yields are continuing to be under a little bit of pressure here. We will
continue to look for ways to offset that through deposit side. But as our deposit costs have come so low, it's going
to be hard to keep up with the changes in the yield curve. Those are really the puts and takes. It's just how much
the yield curve continues to change and evolve and how much pressure that puts on continuing loan yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hey Jim – I mean Scott, the only thing I might add to that just a reminder. We still have a number of CDs that will
be maturing over the next year almost 75% of our CDs mature in one-year, about a third of those mature in Q1.
So there's some levers there. We still have an exception – a fixed exception price book that we can push on. So
we have some levers on the funding side that will continue to go after. But it's really around new production yields
relative to our portfolio yields that will continue to put pressure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. Perfect. Thank you guys very much.

Good morning, Chris.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. Jim I want to go back to the efficiency program just to
make sure I understand it. I think in your remarks you multiple times talked about operating leverage and you
talked about the efficiency improvement the bank's made over the last couple of years. If I'm thinking kind of in
terms of efficiency ratio, you've been in the high 50s, 58%, somewhere 58% to 60%. Assuming the Fed doesn't
move and if kind of rates kind of are the equalizer here, how do we think about this program in the context of
efficiency? Is this a program to try to maintain efficiency at these levels or drive the efficiency ratio lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's all about the context right in which how much revenue pressure we have from lower margins from
additional Fed rate actions, right. I mean regardless of what the economic environment or interest rate
environment was going to be this year, we were going to accomplish this program for so many reasons, right. It's
the right program to do. It's the right evolution of our company this time. On top of that, it just happens to be a
more challenging interest rate environment for the industry. And so for us I hope ultimately will lead to operating
improvement and efficiency ratio improvements, but I really can't predict what's going to happen with interest
rates this year and the shape of the yield curve continues to be frustrating. All those things I think will help offset
any impacts from a challenging rate environment. But long-term the whole idea is to drive further operating
improvements and efficiency ratio improvements.

You guys have historically kept expense growth at/or below inflation, just trying to tack it from a different angle.
The $40 million that you're talking about for 2021 is – I'm just trying to help as a kind of ballpark for a run rate of
9

dollars, because I think it's a big wildcard. Is the expectation that your core expenses would be down in 2021
relative to 2020 as you kind of hit full steam or is this a way to combat some of the inflationary technology
investments and stuff like that? I'm just trying to get a ballpark of where the expense growth rate will be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean we've done a pretty good job of like say keep expenses below inflation, we'll continue to do that.
Obviously, we'll benefit in 2021 versus 2020 in terms of additional expense saving dollars. We don't think you
guys have the expenses too far off in the model when you adjust for the ONB Way, you adjust for the tax credit
amortization that Brendon talked about, [ph] feel (00:23:16) like the expenses you guys have at consensus makes
sense to us. But again, I would also point out and we'll provide further updates in May, but these revenue
initiatives do require new people, some additional technology. And so, there'll be some expenses related to that.
But on a net basis, it should all improve the bottom line and improve the operating leverage of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And so that expense that you're referring to in consensus, so if I look at consensus 2021 expenses, you're
saying with this announcement you feel good about that or with this announcement you should do better than the
consensus number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I'm saying in 2020 the expense number seems to be on the right trajectory of where we think minus those
adjustments we just talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
And our goal is to again further drive improved operating leverage. And so, we'll continue to watch expenses and
year-over-year from 2021 to 2020 (sic) [2020 to 2021] our expenses should be better.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Sorry to have to start with a CECL question but I'm going to. As you transition the $2.3 billion
of acquired loans from, call it, a PCI world to a PCD world, there should be an impact to net interest income. And
I'm just not sure if you've yet quantified what that impact would be. And if so kind of discuss maybe your high level
thoughts on CECL and thanks for the reserve disclosure but more so on the NII impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Terry, it's Brendon. We don't have a lot of accretion impact related to that movement. It's a relatively small
bucket. The marks on those shouldn't have a huge material impact to our going run rate around accretion. We
calculate that and it's relatively small. I think other institutions might have a slightly larger impact than us around
that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then the reserves on acquired loans, that percentage, I'm guessing, is higher than the core portfolio.
So my question is as we move forward and the acquired loans continue to come down, should the reserve ratio to
total loan, should that come down as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, if you take the $2.3 billion which you're right, Terry, does have a higher mix of commercial. So, the general
impact for CECL might be a slightly higher reserve, but that is embedded in that $35 million to $45 million range
that we provided. So, if you take that and add it to our current reserve, that should give you a pretty good idea of
what the reserve level will be going forward. And then it'll all depend – provisioning will all depend on sort of the
mix of our production. [ph] Having in theory (00:25:59) production will be a little higher, mortgage will be a little
lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then a question for Jim, if I think about what Bob did at Old National, moved from a community bank to a
super community bank. Today, we are talking about moving from that super community bank to a regional bank. I
guess what were some of the risks that you discussed internally as it relates to what this could mean to the
commercial bank and the community bank as well given that their very strong deposit base that comes through
the community bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Let me first start with, at our heart, we are a community bank. We continue to be involved in our
communities. We think we're better at it than most banks are in terms of how we continue to support our
communities and how we continue to serve our clients. So that really doesn't change regardless of the ONB Way.
Having said that, as we get bigger and our clients are more diverse and we're more spread farther apart, we
recognize the need that our platform maybe wasn't as scalable as it was under that more geography-centric
structure. It was hard for Jim to tack on another region with another CEO. So more presence on top of that, that
11

became more challenging for us. So, we think this new structure, we've broken the company up into three primary
segments to face off with clients and then support that with our operations and IT and finance functions, all makes
a lot of sense to us.
And we think this is pretty typical of banks our size when they get to this point where they have to think about the
evolution of its structure. I'm also really excited about some of the talent we're able to bring to the organization.
When we're out telling our story, whether it's to individual relationship managers in markets or whether it's to
senior leaders in our company, people are pretty excited about the story here at Old National, and they see this
as a place for them being successful. And I think this organizational structure helps us support that.
And then, we're also obviously able to generate a savings that we're reinvesting back in ourselves in better
technology to make the organization more efficient, but also improve our client offering. So I think this is just a
natural evolution for where Old National's been over its 185 years, but I also think that makes the platform more
scalable for us going forward.

Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Mr. Siefers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just want to drill down into the expense base in the fourth quarter of 2019 for
a bit, came in a little higher than I had anticipated, and you guys called out the incentive comp, for example. How
much of that ends up indeed being transitory, in other words, comes kind of immediately back down and how
much is this sort of a – if at all, is the higher sort of structural level [indiscernible] (00:28:51)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Sure. Brendon will walk you through the changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. Yes, Scott. Most of that $4 million would walk right back down in the first quarter. What you'll see though is
then we'll be adding in payroll taxes and then merit in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned earlier, we feel pretty
good around the consensus estimate excluding the ONB Way initiatives that are out there for the full-year of
12

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
2020. If you back off the $22 million we expect in 2020 related to ONB Way and then adjust for the $13 million in
tax credit amortization, that gets you to a pretty good view of how we're looking at expenses next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. And then just on the tax credit amortization, I could be mistaken, but I thought we were sort of
stepping back from that business and the next year will be much bigger. What are sort of the dynamics around
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We're not stepping back in that business, but there is a certain type of federal historic tax credit that's a one
year deal, that creates this kind of volatility that we're talking about today. We have a handful of credits that were
originated some time ago that will be running through this year. This is the last of these tax credits. They're no
longer available to be done going forward. So, this is the last of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Scott, these are projects that we're working on for – there's a long runway for these projects and these projects
were the last of those projects and quite frankly the last of the one year that we're even eligible to be done. So, we
hope through this fund structure as we talked about before will create less volatility that fund continues to get
bigger. But these are the last of those kind of one year deals that unfortunately we just have to push through with
this accounting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And then, just in terms of how the impacts will flow through
throughout 2020, is that going to be kind of evenly through the year or will there be lumpiness?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good question. A bulk of that actually comes in the first half of the year. But again, these are historic deals. So,
you have to get certificates of occupancy and things like that. And so, those things could – there could be some
timing push from 2Q to 3Q. But think of bulk of that stuff to happen in the first half of the year. But again, the tax
rate effect is a full year tax effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.

But a bulk of the expenses actually come through when they get [ph] displaced into (00:31:09) service and we
think that's going to be in the first half of the year with a little bit tailing in the third quarter and fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay, perfect. Thank you guys very much.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Swanson with Hovde Group.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Hi Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Swanson Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hi guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Swanson Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Good morning. I appreciate the comments on M&A. But I was just curious on your thoughts around some of the
larger community bank and regionals teaming up through MOEs and kind of the transactions being generally
more accepted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think there's a little bit of a mixed track record here on some of those transactions. And we continue to
look at all forms of M&A as you would expect us to do. And for us Plan A is continue to do the types of deals
we've done which is to continue to expand our footprint, build scale in existing footprint, try and drive efficiencies
out of that scale. That would be Plan A. But as you would imagine our board looks at all types of transactions and
we'll continue to look at those opportunities as they evolve. But as I said earlier, I mean those – any transaction
has a higher hurdle today given our focus on needing to achieve the initiatives and milestones embedded within
the ONB way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Swanson Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Most of my other questions are answered, but maybe just one more. It looked like end-of-period basis indirect
increased a little bit this quarter. Was that just a timing issue or is there a change in the thought on that portfolio?

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. No change in thought. That portfolio ebbs and flows and sometimes you have more rundown than others. It
just happened to be a little bit higher production on a net basis.

Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yes sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks Jim. Just to make sure I'm clear on the expenses. Slide 22, where you give the one-time charges
for 2020 and also the recurring benefit. Brendon, was your comment that you're comfortable with 2020
consensus? I think you said excluding the [indiscernible] (00:33:22) and the implementation charges or is it
including the – what it looks like $20 million – a little over $20 million of benefit, just trying to get a sense of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We're comfortable with the consensus kind of on a standalone basis. And then you can add in the impact on slide
22 plus the tax credit amortization. Is that clear?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So comfortable with consensus. But then if you hit the $1 million, $5 million, $7 million, $9 million per
quarter, we would need to reduce expenses by that amount. Is that what you're saying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. You take that expense line and then you can subtract the consensus estimates and then you can subtract
the full year $22 million benefit from ONB Way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So you're comfortable with where it was prior to the announcement...
