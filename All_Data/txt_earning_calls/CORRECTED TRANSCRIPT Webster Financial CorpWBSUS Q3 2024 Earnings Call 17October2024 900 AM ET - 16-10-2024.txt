Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Thanks, Emlen. Good morning and welcome to Webster Financial Corporation's third quarter 2024 earnings call.
We appreciate you joining us this morning. I'm very pleased to welcome Neal Holland as he is joining his first
earnings call as Webster's CFO. As we anticipated, Neal has hit the ground running since he officially stepped
into the role in mid-August, and you can already see the impact of some of the steps his team has taken to
optimize, the positioning of our balance sheet and grow interest income this quarter.
Luis Massiani, Webster's President and Chief Operating Officer, is also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call
today. I'll provide remarks on our high-level results and operations before turning it over to Neal to cover our
financial results in greater detail.
We're really pleased with our strategic and tactical accomplishments in the quarter. I'll hit the highlights, and Neal
will provide more details. We grew deposits 3.6% in the quarter, including growth in DDA, overall commercial
deposits, and HSA. We grew loans 0.7% in the quarter, consistent with our full year growth expectations,
excluding a $300 million securitization we performed to reduce our CRE concentration, our growth was 1.3% in
the quarter, with accelerating growth in C&I categories.
We further reduced our CRE concentration through payoffs and reclassification of certain healthcare-related
loans. As a result, our CRE outstanding as a percentage of tier 1 capital and reserves declined from 285% to
approximately 265% at the end of Q3. Our net interest income grew quarter-over-quarter and increased over last
year's comparable period in line with our full year expectations. We benefited from asset growth and a balance
sheet repositioning.
We continue to mitigate our asset sensitivity, positioning us well as rates continue to come down. Our capital
levels remained strong with our CET1 now in excess of our current operating target of 11%, resulting from
earnings and capital optimization activities, providing us capital flexibility in 4Q and beyond. Our expenses
remained well-managed, resulting in a third quarter efficiency ratio of 45%. Still, in an industry-leading position.
I'll now turn to our financial performance for the quarter beginning on slide 2. On an adjusted basis for the quarter,
we generated a return on average assets of 1.22%, and a return on tangible common equity of 17.3%. Our
adjusted EPS was a $1.34. Our profitability and return metrics remain favorable to peers again this quarter.
At this point, most of you are familiar with slide 3, which illustrates our diverse and versatile deposit base. As I
mentioned upfront, our robust growth this period came from a breadth of the segments on the slide, including
lower cost channels in our Commercial Bank, HSA Bank and Ametros.
We executed on the $400 million deposit opportunity for HSA Bank we discussed last quarter, which provided a
nice boost to deposits there. Strong execution within the Commercial Bank added to lower cost funding growth as
well. Our ability to generate low cost funding across a number of business segments continues to be a
tremendous advantage in growing our balance sheet efficiently and profitably.
Moving to slide 4, I will review our commercial real estate portfolio as that has been a continued focus of
investors. The segment of the CRE portfolio on which we have been most focused continues to be traditional
office. The portfolio balance continues to shrink with $917 million in outstandings at quarter end, down roughly
45% from the first half of 2022. We did see some continued negative migration this quarter, with non-accrual
loans decreasing to 14% from 9% last quarter, largely as a result of two larger credits.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
We continue to be proactive in identifying and managing problem credits and prudently managing reserves in the
sector. While there's been an investor focus, there have been no significant changes in the quality of our rent
regulated multifamily portfolio, where credit performance has held up consistently well.
On credit, more generally, we continue to see negative risk rating migration in the quarter as we keep a close eye
on credit at a later stage in the cycle. We did see our nonaccrual loans increased by $50 million this quarter,
primarily driven by the aforementioned office portfolio migration. Outside of CRE office, negative migration was
generally credit specific across the portfolio and not driven by one industry sector or asset class or the healthcare
related portfolios continue to show some weakness.
While we have seen continued migration and we'll continue to be proactive in our risk reviews, our realization of
loan losses remains in the range we have observed in recent quarters and importantly is consistent with through-
the-cycle and pre-pandemic commercial annualized charge-off rates.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neal to cover our financials in more detail.

William Neal Holland
Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 5 with our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the
quarter. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $230 million and diluted EPS
of $1.34. Adjustments consisted of a pre-tax $20 million securities repositioning charge, a $16 million impact from
the exit of non-core factoring operations, and a $22 million of strategic restructuring costs.
Turning to slide 6, total assets were $79 billion at period-end, up $2.6 billion from the second quarter, mirrored by
robust deposit growth of $2.2 billion. Deposit growth was aided by a seasonal surge in public funds of $1.1 billion.
As a result of the substantial deposit growth, we are holding higher cash balances than we have historically. We
also exhibited solid loan growth of 1.3%, excluding the securitization.
The loan-to-deposit ratio was 80.5%. Tangible book value increased to $33.26 per common share, with the
increase from the prior quarter driven by retained earnings and positive movement in AOCI due to the low rate
environment. Capital levels improved significantly. The common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.23%, up 64 basis points
linked-quarter, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.48%.
In addition to internal capital generation, the TCE ratio benefited from the improvement in AOCI. The common
equity tier 1 ratio also benefited from several actions we undertook to optimize asset risk weighting as well as the
securitization. In total, these actions added 44 basis points to our common equity tier 1 ratio.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 7. In total, loans were up $374 million or 0.7% linked quarter, excluding CRE,
other loan categories grew by 3.2% this quarter. Commercial real estate balances were down $570 million as we
experience some natural attrition in addition to the securitization. This accelerates our path to our target of 250%
of capital plus reserves.
The securitization creating capacity and adds – and allows us to add commercial real estate relationships with
attractive risk-reward characteristics. The yield on the portfolio was flat given the mix of new loan originations and
repricing of floating rate loans on the September Fed move. We provide additional details on deposits on slide 8.
We grew total deposits by $2.2 billion with diverse growth across categories. The pace was accelerated this
quarter due to seasonal inflows of public deposits and a discrete opportunity with a HSA bank that added $400

million of low-cost deposits. DDA balances increased by over $700 million this quarter, with the majority of the
increase coming from seasonal effects. However, it is still encouraging to see normalization in the DDA balances
after several quarters of declines.
Moving to slide 9, net interest income was up $18 million from the prior quarter, driven by balance sheet growth
and higher earning asset yields. Adjusted non-interest income was up, $1 million. Adjusted expenses were up $2
million and the provision decreased by $5 million. Excluding adjustments, our tax rate was 22.2%. Overall,
adjusted net income was up $14 million relative to the prior quarter. Our efficiency ratio was 45%.
On slide 10, we highlight net interest income, which increased $18 million or 3.1% linked quarter, driven by
balance sheet growth and the increased earning asset yield. The net interest margin was up 4 basis points to
3.36%. Our yield on earning assets increased 4 basis points over the prior quarter, with loan yields flat and the
securities portfolio up 24 basis points. In the third quarter, we incrementally sold securities with a book value of
$304 million and reinvested with an approximate 400 basis point improvement in yields with minimal impact to
capital ratios. We anticipate an earn-back of less than two years. Our net, we were able to maintain our total
deposit cost effectively flat for the quarter.
Slide 11 illustrates the progress Webster has made in mitigating its asset sensitivity over the past three years, by
increasing the duration of our assets and reducing the duration of our liabilities.
On slide 12 is non-interest income, which was up $1 million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis. Adjusted
income included both a $3.8 million negative CVA, and $4.4 million gain on the securitization. We continue to
experience pressure on core fee growth. Year-over-year, fees are up $3 million, including the impact of Ametros
acquisition, offset by year-over-year changes in CVA.
Non-interest expense is on slide 13. We reported adjusted expenses of $328 million, up $2 million for the prior
quarter, driven by modest increases in technology, human capital and occupancy costs.
Slide 14 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which was up $19 million relative to the prior
quarter. After booking $35 million in net charge-offs, we recorded $54 million provision, primarily due to credit
factors. As a result, our allowance coverage to loan increased to a 132 basis points from a 130 basis points last
quarter.
Slide 15 highlights our key asset quality metrics. As you can see on the four charts, we saw continued migration
in the quarter. Net charge-offs came in at $36 million versus $33 million in the prior quarter.
On slide 16, we enhanced our already strong capital levels. As we noted previously, we took several actions to
improve our capital ratios in the quarter, including reviewing the risk weighting of our multifamily, lender finance
and public sector portfolios as well as the securitization of multifamily loans. These actions, in combination with
organic capital generation and lower AOCI losses, led to a significant increase in our capital ratios this quarter.
I will wrap up my comments on slide 17 with our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect loans to grow by 1% to
1.5% with growth across the diverse categories, including the potential for some modest growth in commercial
real estate. We are anticipating deposits will decline by around 1% as seasonality in the public funds business
leads to outflows.

We expect net interest income in the range of $590 million to $600 million on a non-FTE basis. This is within the
guidance range we provided on the second quarter earnings call. Our net interest income outlook assumes 50
basis points of cuts in the first, fourth quarter with 25 basis points each in November and December.
Adjusted non-interest income will be $85 million to $90 million. We anticipate adjusted expenses will be in the
range of $335 million, with an efficiency ratio in the mid-40s. Our near-term common equity tier 1 ratio remains
11%.
With that, I'll turn it back to John for closing remarks.

John R. Ciulla
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Neal. I'm anticipating will receive questions on our priorities for capital allocation given the sharp increase
in our capital ratios in the quarter. While we continue to prioritize funding organic balance sheet growth and
complementary tuck-in acquisitions, our capacity to return capital to shareholders has increased since the second
quarter, and we will be prudent and proactive managers of capital.
We are well-positioned to maintain our profitability profile. As Neal detailed, we have proactively managed our
balance sheet over the past year to ensure stable net interest income in a declining interest rate environment,
both in terms of managing our funding costs and tweaking the profile of our earning assets. We have capacity and
capability to grow our balance sheet via the diversified mix of loan and deposit categories, while at the same time,
maintaining flexibility on capital allocation.
And our efficiency ratio remains among the best of our peers. We have retained superior profitability even as we
invest in people, processes and technology. On the latter, over the last 24 months, we have made significant
investments to strengthen our technology foundation, including the modernization of our core banking platform,
building, advanced BSA, AML competencies and heightening our cybersecurity and cloud capabilities.
Finally, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their continued effort. Their hard work is reflected in our performance
this quarter, particularly in our strong deposit growth in favorable categories. Thank you again for joining us today.
Operator, we will open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with
KBW. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe John or Neal, the actions you took with the balance sheet obviously set up for a better, more neutrally
positioned balance sheet going into 2025. How do we think about, I guess, trough NII? Is Q4 the trough? How are
you thinking about it given you freed up a little bit of space on the balance sheet? Yeah, maybe I'll leave it there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Neal Holland A
Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we came in at 3.36% for the quarter. As you look at how we exited Q3, we're going to be holding a little
bit more cash on the balance sheet, which, in Q4, will have a slight drag to NIM.
So we're kind of – in the – Q4 are going to be in 3.32% range and having that exit velocity in the next year, and
then kind of staying right in that level into 2025 is how we think about NIM. So we think we're at a stable NIM. We
may be at plus or minus 3 basis points as we move forward. But that's the range we're looking at, going forward,
into 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. And then my follow-up, John, you alluded to the capital return flexibility. Could you maybe just rank
order and also the timing of what you think you might be able to return more capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I think we always talk about kind of prioritizing for organic balance sheet growth, thinking about
doing things like we've done with Ametros and interLINK and Bend. And then, obviously, if there's no other
productive use of capital, I do think, given where we are and the fact that we do think with interest rates coming
down, that we should see an inflection point in credit as we get into this quarter in the first half of 2025, that we're
more likely to begin repurchases again, absent other organic opportunities to deploy that capital, Chris. So I think
we're there. We feel really good about our capital levels now, and we have some more flexibility. So we're more
likely than we were before in the next quarter or two to begin share repurchases absent other uses of organic
deployment.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Looking at maybe loan growth as we exit 2024 going into 2025. How much additional attritional headwind should
we expect from CRE? It sort of sounds like maybe not that much, but – and should we expect or anticipate that
maybe the overall loan growth rate starts to accelerate as we exit the year going into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, it's a great question, right? Loan growth has clearly been muted for the industry in the last couple of
quarters. We did have a really good quarter in many core C&I categories and I will say that that sort of pull
through has continued early on in this quarter. Although, we know that the fourth quarter is also subject to
significant prepayments and there's a lot of activity, particularly on transactional sponsor and specialty deals. So
that's why we didn't really change our guidance for the fourth quarter. I think you've heard me say and for 10
years or so, we've been able to kind of grow commercial categories in the high single digits to around 10%.
I think right now our view of 2025, Jared, is that we see there's continued kind of modest loan demand. So I think
right now we think about next year as a 5%-ish kind of loan growth. We're going to give formal 2025 guidance
when we get into the January call. Could we outperform that? Sure. I think I've always said I think we can kind of
perform at or better than whatever the market allows, but I think if you read what others are saying and we look
kind of at activity, I think 2025, may not be a blowout year, but be more modest and similar to this year with
respect to loan growth.
With respect to your question about mix and commercial real estate, obviously, we're really pleased this quarter
and I think there's a bit of a template there for us. We had significant organic prepayments, which I know many
others in the industry have reported over the last couple of quarters in CRE. And then, we did the securitization,
which actually was economically beneficial to us in terms of the gain on the transaction. And we look at that not as
just trying to drive down CRE balances as much as we can, but it gives us capacity to support our really good
clients and in full relationships. We're really good at it, and so you will see some level of origination there.
And then at the end of the day, as we grow our capital base and we grow our other C&I classes, you'll see either
flat to modest growth overall in CRE with our ability to maybe exit nonstrategic CRE relationships. But I think we
showed this quarter we can still grow loans at market while not relying on outsized CRE growth.

Luis Massiani A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hello? Hey, Jared. It's Luis. So we do see – we've seen pretty good early indicators that the enrollment season is
going to be as good as we've seen in the recent couple of years. So, we've made a fair amount of investments in
bunch of client-facing technology. We launched the new investment management platform that you may have
seen, we rolled out earlier this year. And so, we feel very good about the investments and how we've positioned
the – and continue to position the HSA business. And we think that you're going to see similar to slightly more
faster deposit growth in 2025 relative to what we saw this year. So we feel good about where HSA is today.

John R. Ciulla A

And Jared, as we usually do in January, we'll be able to give you a kind of a first look at new business and what
we anticipate. And then obviously, at the end of the first quarter, we kind of can final tally what's come in. But I
agree with Luis. I think, it was a good selling season for HSA.

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
John, the Real Deal published an article late last week suggesting that you guys have two large office loans in
New Jersey that are in default to the tune of about $140 million. I guess, I'm wondering, are these on nonaccrual
in the third quarter? And do you have any specific reserves against them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks for the question, Mark. Yeah. So both of those loans – and let me make a couple comments. Obviously
with a $52 billion loan book, we don't generally comment on specific relationships, single point exposures,
litigation and so on and so forth. But obviously, this has become a bit public.
So what I will tell you is, the highlight numbers there are significantly overstate Webster's exposure. Those were
two loans originated pre-merger, one has a Webster exposure under $45 million. The other one is Webster
exposure under $25 million. Both of those loans are on nonaccrual at the end of the third quarter. Both of those
loans have obviously been reviewed and there have been the appropriate charge-offs and specific reserves put
against those loans.
As I mentioned in my early comments, two office loans drove the significant or not – that what the increase was in
non-performers in the quarter. Those were the two loans. And we took charge-offs that, that contributed to the
overall $36 million charge in the quarter. So that's what I'll tell you. Office charge-offs were 55% of the charge-offs
in our quarter. So you can kind of triangulate from there.
But we're pretty good about making sure that we are proactively managing things that things go non-performer
when they're supposed to go and taking charges that we're supposed to take. And so the good thing about being
a company our size right now is we've got significant earnings power. We've got a very high loan loss reserve
compared to our peer median.
And so this quarter, it really didn't have an impact on our overall financial performance. And we feel pretty good
that we've got enough reserves in not only those two loans, but in our overall CRE portfolio that we continue to
work down to not have there be a material financial impact as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's great. And then just as a follow-up, John. You guys have done a great job shrinking the office book. I
guess I wondered if you could share with us what the reserve on the office portfolio is right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's a 6%, Mark. I'll give you – again, I'll repeat what I said – Jason had talked to me when the
portfolio was $1 billion a quarter or so ago. We talked about there being about a third of that, which is kind of
hand-to-hand combat that we're working through. These two credits that I just referenced and that you asked
10


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
about, we're obviously in that kind of third of difficult working through. We've got about a third of the portfolio that
we don't worry about that's highly leased that has long-dated maturities.
And then the stuff in the middle, we continue to kind of just actively manage, and we think we've got enough
secondary and tertiary support as well as in-place leases to kind of work through. So when you think about 6% on
the overall $917 million that's left, remember, there are some specific reserves as well. And when you think about
the reserving, we feel comfortable about it because it's really against that one-third of the portfolio that's most
problematic for us.

I was hoping you could talk a little bit about expectations around loan and deposit betas over the next year or so,
whether or not you've had any early success tweaking and lowering deposit costs. If so, where? And then the
other side of the coin is just given, over the quarters, you've reduced asset sensitivity, whether or not you think
full-cycle loan beta will match what we've seen during the heightened cycle, which was kind of in the low-50%
range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Neal Holland A
Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll jump in there. I think, obviously, we had our first cut in the cycle of 50 basis points, and we took pretty
quick action on the deposit portfolio. And we've repriced down $27 billion, $28 billion of that portfolio at about – of
our deposit portfolio at about a 60% beta. So, it's kind of $16 billion and 100% beta, or if you look at our total
book, about 25% beta so far.
Our interlinked deposits, basically 100% almost immediate beta, and those are over $7 billion. We saw some nice
pricing down in our commercial deposit portfolio, 60% beta, so far on our online portfolio with Brio and then a
bunch of different moves that our consumer portfolio through the first cut. So we're feeling pretty good there. As
you take a step back and look at our overall portfolio, within the next year, we expect approximately $30 billion of
11


Webster Financial Corp.
(WBS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
our loans and securities in cash to reprice. That's $28 billion in loans and $1 billion in securities. So our securities
book is fixed and long with less than $1 billion out of our $17 billion portfolio there or variable.
So we kind of look at that as the repricing side on the loans. And if you flip to the deposit side, in the first five
quarters of the upcycle with 34% beta. And we're anticipating approximately 30 basis – a beta of 30% in the first
five quarters down. And if you think about it, 30% beta on a $65 billion portfolio, you do the quick math there,
that's about $19 billion to $20 billion and a 100% beta. We have short borrowings, $3 billion out of $4 billion will
mature this quarter and next we've got a $5 billion hedge portfolio that helps support our current positioning.
And then, there's another large factor for us is that we have approximately $5 billion of fixed rate securities that
mature and churn annually. And those are anticipated to roll-over – roll-off at about 4% and roll back on with new
originations in the 6% range. So 200 basis points or so up. So when you kind of put all that together, we have a
pretty well-balanced position going into next year. And as you can see in our model results, a very neutral
positioning, despite us having a fairly large portion of variable rate load. So a long answer there. But I know it's an
important topic and I think that the team has done a really good job, positioning us for this down rate environment.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I appreciate all that. Thank you. And the follow-up is just on expenses. Expectations around expense growth over
the next year or so, specifically, as it relates to preparation for $100 billion. Should we expect any acceleration in
the coming quarters or year in expense growth as you get ready for this? And what areas do you expect to
address as you kind of piece out infrastructure? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, thank you for the question, and this may leave you a little wanting for more. But as we said, we're
finishing up right now with PWC, our GAAP analysis and our plan for our march to Category 4. I always remind
you that we're three years to four years away from an organic growth perspective in hitting the $100 billion
category. And as we mentioned before, there will be additional expense for us to get there in terms of hiring
people and building out reporting capabilities and technology and, obviously, the expense of [indiscernible]
(00:31:11).
And we're going through right now kind of a cadence of running that through. And our plan is, as I mentioned last
quarter that in January, when we give our 2025 guidance that will include kind of our fully loaded assumptions
about what that means for expenses. I also remind you that we have the three years to four years to spread those
expenses out. And you heard Neal mention earlier, for example, that we took some charges on severance and
reorganization in the quarter.
And a lot of those moves, in terms of exiting non-core businesses and looking at our organization, will free up
dollars to invest. So, as we move forward, you're going to get the answer to the question in January in our 2025
guidance. We think that, that will put additional pressure on our expenses, but it won't be material. We still feel
very confident in our ability to deliver outsized returns as we go through this process. And so, Neal, I don't know if
you want to put a little bit of more flavor around that, but...

Yeah. I think you said that well, John. One of my initial concerns coming into the organization was, hey, we're
running at a 45% efficiency ratio. Are there really opportunities to find more efficiency? And as John mentioned,
the team have done a nice job putting together a small program. And with the restructuring charges we took this
quarter, we expect our expense run rate next year to drop $17 million, which won't flow all to the bottom line. We'll
use some of those dollars to reinvest and prepare for Category 4. So I think it's an example of how we can
continue to find efficiencies to pave our way to that kind of the requirements.
And as John mentioned, we'll talk about specific numbers in Q1. But if you take a step back, we have an expense
base that's just over $1.3 billion. So 1% of that is $13 million. If you add 1% to our expense growth rate over the
next four years, that probably hits a good chunk of what we need to build. I'm not saying that, that's what's going
to happen, but just kind of highlighting that it should be some incremental around the edges on the expense side
versus a kind of a big popup of onetime expenses is the current view. But as John mentioned, we're not fully
through the analysis and preparation and we're making good progress there, and we'll get more details in Q1.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I guess. First, just a follow-up on the credit side. John, I think you mentioned an inflection in credit could lead to
the possibility for increased repurchases going forward. But how should we think about that? Do you think that
non-accruals are at or nearing a peak here? Obviously, there's some uncertainty with how the whole office loan
environment plays out? But just curious how we should be thinking about those nonaccrual and kind of early-
stage credit levels and how that plays into your thinking on net charge-offs as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's a terrific question and one that I loathe answering just because it is difficult to predict. We mentioned
last quarter that this quarter would be less worse if you were and if we were marginally less worse. We've been
through the entire portfolio. We are getting to a point where I think we've identified obviously all – proactively all
the real issues in the portfolio that we go through. And I again remind everybody that if you look at our absolute
13

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
statistics, they're kind of still in line with pre-pandemic statistics. So, I know a lot of CEOs are saying, we're trying
to remind everybody that this hasn't been a cratering of credit. It's been sort of a return to normalcy on credit.
Our hope right now and what we're looking at is we've got interest rates coming down. We've already seen an
increase in commercial real estate refinancing activity based on the behavior of the five-year and the forward
curve. And so, as interest rates come down, if the Fed navigates this soft landing, I do think that we should see
running through bank P&Ls and bank balance sheets, an inflection in credit certainly, in the first half of 2025.
It's tough to call a particular quarter. We have seen some negative risk rating migrations. We've been pleased that
that migration has not continued to result in higher levels of annualized charge-offs. And so, it would be difficult for
me to say, hey, we think 4Q is the bottom, but I do think, all the macro factors and our understanding of our
portfolio that the first half of 2025, we should start to see kind of absolute improvement in the balance sheet.
And obviously, we have a forward look based where we're trading. If you're asking the question with respect to
capital allocation and return of capital, we've got lots of earnings, we've got really good reserves. So, we'll put that
all into the box and decide whether or not in the fourth quarter, we start buybacks or whether or not that's the first
half of 2025 activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Terrific. Thanks for all that color. And then, changing gears here, just looking at loan growth – the loan
growth side, you talked about how the fourth quarter could be impacted by some slower, perhaps C&I and
sponsor with the headwinds you mentioned specifically for prepayments. But just curious, the pace of growth in
the third quarter, what you saw there, if that picked up near the end of the quarter, if it was relatively steady. And
then, just also curious on the residential side, expectations for, how much you're going to be adding to the
portfolio relative to the other sides of the house? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our primary focus is continuing to grow a myriad of C&I categories. I would say that the loan behaviors in
the third quarter, interestingly that 1.3% growth, if you take out the securitization, it was sort of more back ended,
if you will, in the quarter, which gives us some momentum on NII as we go into Q4. And as I've said, we've
continued to see pull through in the – early in the fourth quarter.
The reason we didn't up the guidance is because we know there's a lot of activity both on origination and
prepayments in the quarter and we don't really have full visibility yet. I think we still have pressure on our sponsor
and specialty business from the proliferation of private credit. We're going to have our asset manager program
hopefully up and running in the first quarter, which should give us some additional momentum there. Our middle
market performed well, our public sector finance performed well. We've got other levers to pull in asset-based
lending and in equipment finance.
So, I think with our portfolio, we'll continue to be able to grow C&I categories. You'll probably see some level, as
Neal mentioned, of modest growth in commercial real estate, because right now, if you're good at it and you can
get really nice risk-reward because there are fewer players in the market. And then I think we'll sort of fill in with
our mortgage originations, obviously serving our customers in our market and then some level of correspondent
mortgage origination. So, I would say it's balanced. And on balance, we still think that kind of 5% – if 5%-ish
annualized loan growth is the right number?

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Hey, guys. Good morning. So, on page 6 of the deck, you noted that you've identified and documented certain
loans eligible to optimize RWA treatment. And I know you've been talking about this on the call, but just to
elaborate a bit more on these actions and if you could size how big this was to capital improvement during the
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Neal Holland A
Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think all of our actions in total were about 44 basis points to the quarter. We really went in and did
deep dives into our multifamily, lender finance and public sector portfolios and looked at the risk weighting. I'll give
you an example, kind of in the public sector, we have a lot of loans sitting at 100% risk weighting and general
obligation bonds can be a 20% and revenue pledge at 50%. So we did a lot of work to pull additional data and
really optimize our risk weighting there. That's one example across the categories. So, hopefully, that and then
the – as we mentioned that securitization also helped drive increased capital levels, and that was about 6 basis
points included in that 44 basis points that I just mentioned.

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luis Massiani A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. We don't really think about it that way. I think, that this is – every year, we look at a rolling three-year
technology roadmap and investment initiatives and everything that you highlighted there and that we've
highlighted in the specific items that you were talking about are part of the long-term strategies that we've been
deploying. So there is nothing really new there that we would isolate as something that's going to be recurring
long-term in nature. And Neal, alluded to what we expect expenses are going to be and kind of with the
progression of those are going to be in the 2025.
And, all that estimated projection includes everything that we think is going to be required to continue to
modernize the tech stack, build out the tech stack, invest in the various business lines, invest in risk management
platforms. And so, all – it's all inclusive when we provide that guidance for 2025. And we don't envision that
there's going to be any outsized tech spend in 2025 relative to what you've seen this year. So we feel – again, we
feel pretty good about where our tech – long-term technology roadmap is. And we have a clear path to making the
investments in specific areas to support client experience, while at the same time, building out risk in operating
platforms.

Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Just to go back to office here and certainly, appreciate office is only 2% of your book and you've been very
proactive and transparent. But on your $54 million of loan loss provisions that you took this quarter, how much of
that was office? And then, of the two loans that are new on non-performing, that's $45 million and $25 million. Can
you help us think a little bit about what is the occupancy? What's the new debt service there? And then specific
reserves on those two loans? Certainly under the backdrop that you gave Mark, office reserves are 6% or $55
million. Basically, of your $55 million, what are the specific reserves on those two loans?
And then just sort of final question here on office, specifically that $45 million exposure, that Bankwell just filed,
they're a part of it. And you guys, it looks like where the lead, i.e., Sterling was the lead. Can you just help us think
about, again, this is just per the Bankwell filing that there was a refresh property appraisal done in April at $105
million and then five months later, that property is now worth $36 million. So, if you could just help us think
through any parts of that, that would be really helpful? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Laurie, I don't think – first of all, I don't have all of that information, and I don't think I can give you very good
answers there. I mean, I'll tell you, with respect to CECL and the provisioning for the quarter, there are so many
in-and-outs, right? That there's – you can't identify the amount of the provision related to a specific credit or even
to a specific portfolio because what you're doing is refreshing and updating your risk ratings along with your
qualitative factors and you're coming up with a refreshed life of loan losses for a $52 billion portfolio.
So, certainly the amount of charge-offs impacts what you provide, but it doesn't necessarily immediately correlate
with where the charge-offs came from. So, I don't think I can draw a connection to those two loans to our
provision. I gave you the fact that the charge-offs in the quarter about 55% of the charge-offs were related to
office loans. Those loans we mentioned being the largest drivers. We actually had net recoveries in consumer,
which offset our overall charge-offs a little bit.
So, again, it's tough to draw those conclusions. I certainly don't have the – in-place debt service coverage and
LTVs on those two specific loans now. What I can tell you from the CEO seat is that if they're on nonaccrual, it
means that there is a question as to whether or not the underlying cash flows can repay the loan as agreed.
So we might be able to get you some of that offline with Emlen and Jason, but I can't give you the specifics on
those two transactions. We were the lead lender. You're correct. It was, I think, a 2019 or 2018 origination
significantly pre-merger. So I can tell you that we were the agent on those two credits, and I think that's the
information that I have available to me here, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2024
Yeah. I'll jump in with the September spot margin. So September was a little bit lower. We were about 3.31%.
Loans came down 8 basis points and deposits 2 basis points. I'll caveat that by saying monthly NIM is a little bit
more variable than quarterly NIM. I'll also say that September NIM really represents our repricing dynamics.
SOFR started moving down well before the Fed cuts, and there's obviously some lag there with our deposits
repricing later with the cut coming in the middle of the month.
We also started holding higher levels of cash in September. So, since mid-September, as I mentioned before,
we've taken significant action on our deposit costs, that 25% beta already. And we are confident that our Q4 NIM
will come in above our September spot number. Yes, I think that – and in the transaction there was kind of a – it
happens throughout the quarter, but probably weighted average more to the middle of the quarter.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the securities book and you commented on the roll-on yields being
around 6% expected on the sort of the $5 billion of annual cash flows on that. Obviously, this quarter's was
5.84%. So can you just comment on why this quarter was lower, why you expect it to move higher over the next
12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Neal Holland A
Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So on my comment of that 6%, that was more a mix of loans and securities. So kind of full fixed rate
repricing. To your point, in this quarter, we added a $1 billion at 5.84%. I think we're modeling 5.40% average for
Q4. And our most recent purchase was kind of in between that 5.84% and 5.40%. So I'm feeling good about our
numbers there. But just to clarify that, that 6% of that plus 200 basis points was the repricing of our fixed
securities and loans. So that's why the numbers little bit higher there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks for the clarification on that. And then on the Brio deposit base, you said that 60% beta. Just to
clarify as well. Is that on the new production for this quarter or is that the overall book given the short duration of it
that's already realized 60%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah. The 60% on the overall portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

William Neal Holland A

Yeah. So I think before the cut to where we're priced now, we're down 30 basis points – down 50 basis points for
the cut and we're actively monitoring for potential additional moves. We've done – I think the team has done a
really nice job of balancing liquidity versus earnings. And we've been very prudent in our moves and you'll see
more downward moves from us in the future as we've seen pretty good client reaction so far through the first cut
that we've made.

Great...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luis Massiani A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. There's no real difference. Sam, there is no real – the portfolio is one rate on the portfolio, so new dollars
versus the existing portfolio all, it's not like there's a very diverse product pricing in there. So the way to think
about it is one overall data for the portfolio, which is existing deposits, plus new deposits are all getting originated
at risk – essentially, the same – exact same yields. So the beta on both new and existing would be roughly the
same.
