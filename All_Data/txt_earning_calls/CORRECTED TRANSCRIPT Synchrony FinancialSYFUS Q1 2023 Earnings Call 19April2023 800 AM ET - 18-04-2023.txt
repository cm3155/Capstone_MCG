Thanks, Kathryn. Good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong first quarter results including net
earnings of $601 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible
common equity of 23.2%.
Once again, the power of Synchrony's differentiated business model matched with the continued health of the
consumers we serve, delivered consistent growth across our diversified set of partners and products. On a core
basis, we opened 5.2 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 8% and drove $42 billion in
purchase volume, the highest ever for our first quarter. This milestone was achieved with results across each of
Synchrony's five platforms, highlighting the strength of our diversified model.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 19% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active
accounts and higher spend per active accounts. In Diversified & Value, purchase volume increased 16%, driven
by strong out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance and penetration growth. The 10% growth in Digital
purchase volume was broad based, reflecting growth in active accounts and strong customer engagement. In
Lifestyle, purchase volume increased 9% reflecting higher transaction values primarily in Outdoor and Luxury.
And in Home & Auto, purchase volume increased 6% with the strength in our commercial products and higher
transaction values in Furniture and Home Specialty.
Dual and co-branded cards accounted 41% of total purchase volume and increased 22% on a core basis,
reflecting continued strong response to several new value propositions.
Synchrony's record first quarter purchase volume growth is a testament to the utility of our flexible financing
solutions, the compelling value propositions we offer and the continued resilience of our customers as they
navigate the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates. We regularly monitor our customers' needs and their
financial health through our billions of real-time transaction data. Our insights continue to show only minor
variations in average transaction value and frequency across spend categories.
At a high-level, average transaction values and frequency increased in the quarter across both in-store and out-
of-partner spend, reflecting the continued impact from ongoing inflationary pressure. However, growth in average
transaction values slowed in March, possibly reflecting the early impact of lower tax refunds. More broadly, the
data suggests that our customers are actively managing their budgets as the macro backdrop evolves. We also
continue to see some minor seasonal category shifts within our out-of-partner spend. So the relative mix of
discretionary and non-discretionary spend remains essentially unchanged.
Meanwhile, across the spectrum of credit segments we serve, our highest credit grade borrowers continue to
shop more frequently and spend more when they do. And the sign of their relative health, the transaction
frequency of super-prime customers in certain platforms grew at rates lasting during the summer of 2022. Lower
credit grade borrowers are shopping somewhat less often. This trend has remained relatively stable since the
fourth quarter and follows [ph] apparent (00:05:17) behaviors of this credit segment which migrated toward pre-
pandemic levels in the second half of last year.
In terms of payment behavior, we also continue to see normalizing payment rates across age cohorts and credit
bands, which is to be expected as consumers spend their accumulated savings and begin to revolve their
balances.
Based on the external deposit data we monitor, consumer savings levels continued to decline through March 31
though at a slower pace than we saw through most of 2022. Average consumer deposit balances declined 2%
this quarter, though they remained 10% above 2020. As accumulated savings continued to decline at this modest
pace, we expect our payment revolve trends to further normalize. This in turn will drive continued growth in our
interest bearing loan balances, the return of delinquency and credit loss metrics to pre-pandemic levels, and
better optimize risk-adjusted margins for our business.
Synchrony's business model is designed to support our customers and partners through changing macro
conditions, and in particular, a more normalized operating environment than we've seen since the start of the
pandemic. As this progression back to historical levels continues, we are managing the business prudently for the
long term while watching trends. With that view and given the stable labor markets and the relative strength of the
consumers' balance sheet, we remain positive on the state of the consumer today.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Our confidence comes from our decades of experience managing through economic cycles. This experience
delivers a model that sustainably serves all of our stakeholders. At the crux of it all is our diversified partner
portfolio and product suite, which give us the tools to deliver consistent, high-quality products and results
throughout varying environments.
We continue to build on these strengths in the first quarter as highlighted by our recently announced product
launch, and the addition or renewal of more than 15 partners. In particular, we launched the Synchrony Outdoors
Card, which was in direct response to customer and partner demand in our powersports business, serving as an
example of how our platform realignment is enabling Synchrony to rethink how we deliver for partners and
customers.
Synchrony has long provided valuable installment lending solutions for powersports equipment. However, in this
market, which is projected to reach $131 billion by 2028, there are significant purchases that occur after the initial
purchase, such as accessories, parts, garments, fuel, service and warranties, that were not served by the
installment lending model we have traditionally offered in powersports. Our dedicated platform team with
combined experience across partners and products identified this opportunity to meet our customers' demand and
drive still greater loyalty for dealers.
Turning to our Health & Wellness platform, Synchrony extended relationships with the largest and second-largest
dental association this quarter, solidifying CareCredit as the dental financing solution of choice. More specifically,
we announced a 10-year partnership extension with the American Dental Association, distinguishing CareCredit
as the only ADA-endorsed patient financing solution. This endorsement, which dates back to 2001, includes
special features and offers for more than 159,000 dentist members and their patients.
We also extended our 20-year relationship with the Academy of General Dentistry, remaining the exclusive
patient financing solution for the benefits program of the Academy's more than 35,000 member dentists. These
continued longstanding partnerships underscore the unique value that our integrated CareCredit offering delivers
to both the providers and patients we support. And finally, we announced renewals across an array of partners
this quarter in our Home & Auto platform, including with Havertys and LoveSac.
Synchrony's ability to grow and win new partners, as well as diversify our products, programs, and markets
enables us to drive greater flexibility, utility, and value for our customers, and partners alike, while also enhancing
the resiliency of our business.
In summary, I'm proud of the many ways in which Synchrony continues to meet our customer wherever they are
looking to make a purchase, a payment, or a deposit. As their needs and priorities continue to evolve, Synchrony
is ready, ready to deliver flexibility, value and seamless experiences through more solutions in more locations
along with our industry-leading partners.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance highlighted the continued
strength of the consumer, paired with the power of our diversified sales platforms, compelling value propositions
and prudent financial position. Consumers continue to deepen their engagement with our products. On a core
basis, ending loan receivables growth of 16% was fueled by a 11% stronger purchase volume along with 3%
higher spend per active account.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Net interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion as the growth in loan receivables and an increase in loan
receivable yields drove 15% higher interest and fees. This was partially offset by the impact of the portfolios sold
during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 23%, reflecting the impact of
credit normalization as payment behavior trends toward pre-pandemic levels. Payment rate for the first quarter,
when adjusting for last-year portfolio sales, was 16.7%, approximately 85 basis points lower than last year, and
approximately 150 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average.
First quarter net interest margin of 15.22% declined 58 basis points, primarily reflecting the higher impact of
interest rates on our funding cost, partially offset by better yield trends. Loan receivables yield climbed 97 basis
points and contributed 83 basis points to net interest margin. Incremental liquidity portfolio yield also contributed
an additional 54 basis points. These gains were more than offset by higher interest-bearing liability costs which
increased 219 basis points to 3.43% and reduced net interest margin by 179 basis points. And our mix of interest
earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 16 basis points as we built liquidity to fund the
anticipated growth.
RSAs of $917 million in the first quarter were 4.10% of average loan receivables. The $187-million decline from
the prior year reflected the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022 and higher net charge-offs
partially offset by higher net interest income. RSAs provide [ph] an important line (00:11:58) with our partners and
continue to function as designed by providing a buffer to the financial results of the company and supporting
greater stability in our returns. This was highlighted in the first quarter as RSA provided a buffer to increased net
charge-offs and higher funding costs.
Provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion for the quarter which reflected higher net charge-offs and a $285-
million reserve build. The build included a consideration for the potential macroeconomic effects of industry credit
contraction and a potential impact on consumers, though we did not see any related impacts in our delinquency
performance today.
Other income decreased $43 million, driven primarily by higher loyalty costs, as well as the impact from
investment gains and losses partially offset by higher debt cancellation income. Other expenses increased 8% to
$1.1 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, operational losses, and technology investments.
Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 35% compared to 37.2% last year. In total, Synchrony generated first-
quarter net earnings of $601 million or $1.35 per diluted share, delivering a return on average asset of 2.3% and a
return on tangible common equity of 23.2%.
Next I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. We continue to see credit metrics performing in line with, or better
than 2019 performance as credit normalization continued at a measured pace. Delinquency rates remained at
approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels and recent vintages continued to perform better than those of 2018 or
2019. The continued tapering of accumulated consumer savings is contributing to a slow moderation of payment
behavior towards pre-pandemic levels. As we noted last quarter, the trend of normalization has gradually shifted
into higher credit grades where balances tend to be larger.
As a result, we saw payment rate declines versus prior quarter of approximately 30 basis points, while
delinquencies and losses increased in line with our expectation. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.81%
compared to 2.78% last year, or 4.92% in the first quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.87%
versus 1.30% in the prior year, or 2.51% in the first quarter of 2019. And our net charge-off rate increased to
4.49% from 2.73% last year, still approximately 100 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.44%, up 14 basis points from 10.30% in
the fourth quarter. The sequential increase in the reserve rate primarily reflected the impact of the additional
reserve discussed earlier and seasonally lower receivables. The allowance also reflects a previously announced
$294-million reduction of reserves, or troubled debt restructurings recorded through equity, as we adopted
updated accounting guidance. This guidance reduced our reserve coverage rate by approximately 30 basis points
for the quarter.
In the quarter, Synchrony's management of funding, capital and liquidity remained a source of strength. We said
and maintained appropriate target levels of common equity, liquidity and reserves. We generally manage our
funding strategy to be interest rate neutral to minimize duration risk and the vast majority of our liquidity portfolio
using cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries largely maturing in under one year. So, as depositors across the
country navigate the uncertainty of several bank failures and pronounce the positive flows during mid-March,
Synchrony Bank was well positioned as a reliable source of stability for both our customers and our business.
Our stable direct-to-consumer deposit base is largely insured with no concentrations in geographic areas or high-
balance accounts. Our average depositor has banked with us for approximately five years and nearly 80% of our
deposit balances are more than three years old. The foundation of this loyalty is Synchrony Bank's award-winning
platform and industry-leading customer satisfaction scores. Depositors are attracted to our seamless, digital-first
experience, as well as our competitive rates. In fact, as customers sought to either balance exposure to their
banks or remix their balances to take advantage of available FDIC insurance limits during the last three weeks of
March, Synchrony Bank saw net deposit inflows of nearly $700 million, as we generated double-digit account
growth sequentially.
This contributed to first quarter deposit growth of 17% versus last year, and $2.7 billion sequentially to reach
$74.4 billion. At quarter-end, over 91% of Synchrony Bank direct deposits were fully insured.
And now looking at April trends, Synchrony Bank activity has returned to more seasonal flows powered by
continued growth in new account and deposits. Our deposit base provides a strong foundation for our business
representing 83% of our total funding and is complemented by our securitized and unsecured debt which
represented 7% and 10% of our funding respectively, and increased by $1.7 billion versus the prior year. This
increase included the issuance of 10-year subordinated debt, an important milestone as we continue to more fully
develop our capital stack and reach target capital levels.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $21.7 billion or 20.2% of our total assets, up 148 basis
points from last year, as we grew deposits and pre-funded our projected loan receivables growth.
Moving now to discuss Synchrony's capital position. As we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL
transition rules issued by the joint banking agencies, Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of
approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics in January, and we will continue each year until the
January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.
Further, the TDR reserve reduction mentioned earlier was recognized net of tax in equity, adding approximately
25 basis points to our capital ratios.
We ended the first quarter at 12.5% CET1 under CECL transition rules, 250 basis points lower than last year's
level of 15%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.3% with CECL transition rules, compared to 15.9% last year. The
total capital ratio decreased 180 basis points to 15.4% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-
in basis decreased to 22.5% compared to 24.5% last year.

Synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns on the first quarter. In total, we returned $500
million to shareholders through $400 million of share repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends.
As of quarter-end, our remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $300
million. Synchrony remains well-positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business
performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We'll also continue to seek
opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock.
Finally, please refer to slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full year 2023 outlook.
Overall, first quarter purchase volume came in ahead of our expectations, which when combined with slightly
faster payment rate normalization than anticipated, delivered stronger receivables growth for the quarter. As a
result, we now expect annual receivables to grow by 10% or more by year-end, although we anticipate payment
rates ending the year well above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect net interest margin of 15% to
15.25%, this outlook reflects the benefit of favorable trends in our deposit betas and payment rates during the first
quarter, balanced by anticipated impacts of the broader market uncertainty. These potential impacts include
holding higher liquidity levels in anticipation of growth funding needs, as well as competitive dynamics within the
industry that could lead to higher betas.
Meanwhile, credit normalization continues on track in line with our expectations in terms of both our delinquency
and loss trends. As a reminder, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise and approach pre-pandemic levels by
mid-year. Net charge-off should follow a similar but lagged progression relative to the normalization in
delinquencies. [ph] Loss dollars (00:20:26) will rise through 2023 but will not reach fully normalized levels till
approximately six months following the peak in delinquencies.
As such, we continue to expect a net charge-off rate for the full year 2023 of 4.75% to 5% and that our portfolio
will now reach its annual underwriting loss target range of 5.5% to 6% until 2024. Given our unchanged outlook
for net interest margin and net charge-offs, the RSA remains unchanged between 4% and 4.25% of average loan
receivables, and we remain committed to delivering operating efficiency for the full year with a target of
approximately $1.125 billion in operating expenses per quarter.
In sum, Synchrony's model is built for sustainable performance and strong risk-adjusted returns as we grow to
meet the needs of our customers, our partners and our shareholders. As conditions normalize, we remain on
track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks and thanks, Brian and Brian. I guess the first question I'd like to ask is, given that you're now seeing
this normalization of profitability as you're going through this process of losses normalizing and you do have the
current economic outlook with the variability around it, could you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking
about growth in new accounts and the discussions that you are having with your partners, both about your ability
to continue to grow, and their – how they are thinking about the RSA that they receive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Good morning, Moshe. So, the conversation with the partners, they are most certainly looking to us to help drive
their new customers and to grow sales. The competitive retail environment is very difficult for them right now and I
think the ability for us to bring a multi-product facet to them is very enticing. Now, we just continue to work with
them about what the right placement is of products. And when we think about the profitability, we are returning
back to normal levels, most certainly the funding cost is higher than what we traditionally have seen historically.
And they understand that and the conversations around the RSA, they do recognize that they've benefited over
the last couple of years with the downside of the market and they're willing to participate. That's the economic
arrangement we've had and none of them are really pushing back. They most certainly are cautious and want to
understand how credit's developing, whether that – we're going to take actions at some point which may impact
their sales, but for the most part, they have been supportive and really looking for us to continue to drive volume
for them and new customers. I don't know Brian, if you want to add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I would just add Moshe, we talked about this in the past that I think in periods of uncertainty, and clearly
we're in a somewhat uncertain period right now, this is when we see our partners engage even more in the card
programs, and that's great for us. The level of engagement I would say across big partners and small partners
has never been higher than it is right now. They are very engaged, they are working with us on really trying to
understand what the consumer is doing, how they're going to behave over the next 12, 24 months, and we're
seeing great engagement in the multiproduct strategy as well.

That's something that we anchored on a couple of years ago, lot of momentum across the business on it and I
think as partners are kind of taking a step back and trying to figure out the macroeconomic environment and the
consumer trends, they are also rethinking the financial products that they offer and kind of rationalizing their point-
of-sale. And I think that definitely plays to our strength.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks, and Brian Wenzel, you said that your margin outlook talked – considered an industry environment
that could lead to higher betas. It seems like from the actions that you've taken and others, and the deposit kind of
inflows that it seems like the opposite is happening I guess. Maybe could you just talk a little bit in more detail
about what you're actually seeing and what it would take for things to either get better or worse from a deposit
beta standpoint from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks Moshe. So, as we entered the year, we anticipated our betas to rise from last year. There was a
shift in the end of last year, where it got highly competitive with some of the regional banks. So, when you looked
at our betas at the end of last year, they were roughly low to mid-70s on high-yield savings and around 80% on
CDs. As we came into 2023, we anticipated probably a 10- to 15-point beta rise in high-yield savings and
probably a 20-basis-point – or essentially 100% or more beta on CDs, right, that's how we came into the year.
I'd say the market, for the most part, since the third week of December through the end of the first quarter was
very rational and the betas performed better than our expectation right? So, you look at betas now, they are
probably mid-70s on savings, and about 90% on CDs. Our outlook though, Moshe, is what's baked into the NIM
guidance, is that we still go back to those original points where you're going to be mid-80s on high-yield savings
and over 100% on CDs just because of the fact that there may be other banks who have seen deposit outflows
may get more aggressive.
Again, we haven't seen that yet, but that's what's in the outlook. So, hopefully, that doesn't develop, which would
give us some potential upside.

Morning, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Brian, maybe I'll just start on the allowance. Given the accounting change, can you maybe just remind us what's
included from a macro perspective? And then second, you talked about normalization still being 20% low and you
gave us nice progression on the charge-offs, but I guess, given the backdrop plus the amount of growth you're
anticipating, how do you think about delinquencies and charge-offs leveling off versus the risk of overshooting just
given the impact of growth math and the softening macro backdrop? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, let me try to unpack that question, Ryan, good to talk to you this morning. So, first, when you think about
the TDR accounting change, this was one where we, like many others, have chose retroactive treatment. So,
there was a reduction to the reserve that went, net of tax, through equity on January 1. As we came into the
quarter, the reserve is fundamentally two things: one, the seasonal paydown and purchase [indiscernible]
(00:28:59) – seasonal paydown was lower than our – or lower than expectations, and then purchase volume was
higher than our expectations which gave us a greater asset position at the end of the quarter, which led to the
growth-driven reserve provision.
When you think about the components of what's in the reserve from a macroeconomic standpoint, effectively,
what we have – and when you look all the way through the baseline model through the qualitative reserves, our
unemployment is effectively 6%. So, in this reasonable forecastable period, if unemployment stays below 6%, we
should not have rate-driven reserve provisions. Again, during this quarter though, given the banking turmoil and
the potential contraction of credit, we did add to the macroeconomic overlay to deal with the potential fall-through
effects to the consumer.
As I think about it stepping forward what I'd say is we expect really, generally, growth-driven reserves, I mean,
provision increases, and that should be in line with what we thought about. That said, we still believe that we're
going to trend downward over time as we move out through the end of the year and into next year, down to that
adjusted CECL day-1 reserve post.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you for the color. And maybe just on capital, Brian, you noted that you're well positioned to continue
to return capital to shareholders. At 12.5% you're obviously approaching the 11% target. Can you maybe just
think about how you manage capital in this kind of environment, given obviously pretty robust asset growth, but
clearly a potential recession being on the horizon, plus getting close to your targets? Maybe just talk about some
of the puts and takes, and how you're thinking about managing the capital base over an intermediate timeframe.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
You know, Ryan, the thing I try to get – try to convey is that when you run your loss stress testing models under
these severe and idiosyncratic events, unemployment's up to 10%. So in theory, you go through and you run
those stresses. So, we look at – even if you had some form of recession that came about in the short to medium
term, in theory, our capital provision and our buffers will be able to withstand that. So, we don't necessarily look at
that as something where we would sit back and say, we should stop or curtail some of the repurchases or the
level of repurchases, [ph] I would say (00:31:26). So, the economic event is really baked into our capital forecast
and our capital plan.
As we think about the priority, you hit it right, the first thing we think about is the organic growth of the company,
second is dividends, and third comes down to whether or not we have inorganic opportunities, and/or share
repurchases. So, some of the cadence that might come about over the next couple of years, are there assets that
come available that we want to deploy capital into? But right now, again, we're going to continue to return
shareholders to – return capital to shareholders in line with what we've been doing historically, and [ph] short it
(00:32:01) down towards the 11%. Again, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that we do have to finish
development of our preferred stack, but that's not necessarily something we need to do today.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the RSA. At 4.1% [ph] in the quarter (00:32:32) , I think it was about 20
basis points lower than where consensus had. And as we think about normalizing credit for the rest of the year,
should we expect the rest of the year to be at the lower end of the range that you gave us, Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Good morning, Erika. So again, we gave you the range of 4% to 4.25%, it's going to really depend upon how net
interest margin plays out when you think about the funding cost of the business. Losses again is in that same
range, the 4.75% to 5%, so it's really going to play really on how the deposit betas play through and how that –
the benchmark interest rates flow through to our partners, but we expect it to be in the 4% to 4.25%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I hate to ask about 2024, but a lot of investors are now thinking about credit sensitive financials and
trough earnings in a recession, and expecting trough earnings to be occurring in 2024. So, as we think about the
dynamics of your net charge-off dollars reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2024, the potential for Fed cuts,
12

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
potentially supporting your margin as you reprise deposits down, how should your prospective and current
investors think about the RSA in that environment? Right? Because I think that as investors think about the step
function higher in net charge-offs, is there a way for them just to easily say okay here's the step function lower on
RSA in a recessionary year, that's unique to your stock?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah thanks for the question. So first let me just talk about credit for a second. We ended the quarter – if you look
back at the historical delinquency rates, we have been trending about 10 basis points a quarter up on the
normalization curve, and we ended fourth quarter 2022 at roughly 80%. We ended the first quarter 2023 at
roughly between 75% and 77%, so credit is normalizing in a way in which we expected, and to stay on that
trajectory. As you slide into 2024, we expect the loss rate to be back to our underwriting target of that 5.5% to 6%.
There are dynamics that play through. You're right. If you believe we go back to that type of environment which
would have a slightly normal – a higher, or a more normalized unemployment rate, you're then going to see your
payment rate come back in line which should give you a tailwind relative to interest and fees, but then we also
expect the prime rate and the interest bearing liabilities cost to come down. Those are all kind of working at two
effective tailwinds, headwind with net charge-offs as that goes – all goes back through the RSA's. So, when you
think about that, you have plus and minuses. There could be a period of time which we hit below 4% for a quarter
or two, and then you should come back in line with what I would think the longer term financial framework which
we gave you which is in that 4% to 4.5%.

...my questions – good morning, thanks. [ph] The real one (00:36:04) is just noticing just that you've had a good
migration towards more use of Co-Brand and Dual Card. Brian, you talked about kind of product expansion earlier
in the call. I'm just wondering, given that migration, what are you seeing? Are you seeing any changes in
customer activity that are worth noting and is that tied to product expansion, or is there other sources of that?
13

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah John, I'll start and then ask Brian to add some color. I think the Dual Card/Co-Brand strategy has been one
that we've leaned on heavily over the last decade, and what we really like about is the ability to migrate our best
customers, and our partners' best customers into a product that has world spend capabilities, and the way that
they earn on that card typically gives them a reason to go back into the partners' stores. So, we like the synergies
there and we are seeing above-average growth in Dual Card in world sales, which is great for us, great for our
partners as well.
Just taking a step back as we think about the multi-product strategy, it's really is one that you could envision
starting with at the kind of lower end of the spectrum of secured card, of buy now, pay later, shorter term
installment loan migrating into a revolving product, PLCC, and ultimately into a Dual Card or a Co-Brand Card.
We think that strategy is a winning one. We think that economically to us when we think about the risk and return
profile, that allows us to cater to a very wide cross section in terms of our partners' customers. And so, that's
where I think we've seen a real change just in the last two or three years as we've been engaging with our
partners on the multi-product strategy.
A lot of engagement, a lot of momentum there, and I think that over time that's a winning strategy for us. And
maybe Brian just add a little color if there's any changes in terms of the trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, so remember John as we always talked about, the customers that seek our cards out are the most loyal
customers of our partners, right? So, they are engaged with that brand, want that value back in the brand, and
when we look through to the categories of spend that we see [ph] keeping (00:38:28) on the Dual Card, they're
very consistent in how they rank order very sticky. So, like our number one world spend category is bill pay. You
think about top-five, you have grocery in there, you have restaurants in there. Those are things which are
everyday type events that are sticky and continuous. And if they're earning benefits back into a brand which they
like, they're going to continue to do that.
So when you look at transaction values and frequencies, it's for me relatively consistent, which goes back to the
point we always – we talk about Dual Card when you think about some of the other brands that are in there that
may not necessarily be Dual Card, but have wide utility in some of our digital partners. We have a broad swath of
this business that goes across multi set of categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, that's very helpful color. And then Brian Wenzel, apologize if you gave some of this color on the prepared
remarks, but any – I know you captured guidance for NIM for instance, and RSAs, but is there any seasonal
considerations we should think about those over the course of the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, so, again there will be seasonal trends obviously. I think about charge-off and you generally have a
seasonal increase in the second quarter from charge-offs on an interest margin basis. We will have some
seasonalities, we prefund some of the back end of the year growth into the first quarter into the liquidity profile, so
you may see them come down and back up, and charge-offs be a little bit higher in the second quarter. But I think
14


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
when you look at charge-offs and it's important to note, the pace of acceleration that I highlighted just a couple of
minutes ago, that we're still at 80% of the historical delinquency levels.
And when you look at the delinquency increases third quarter to fourth quarter, and fourth quarter to first quarter,
they have slowed. So, again, on a dollar basis, [ph] the sign's up (00:40:20) you'll see it in receivables, a seasonal
low in the second quarter, and then you'll see the receivables grow and the loss rate kind of flatten out, will be
down back-half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And then anything with respect to NIM fluctuations just as part of that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I tried to hit on NIM, I apologize, John. With regard to it, you'll see a little bit of downward pressure in the
second quarter, then it comes back mainly from prefunding for growth in the back half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
You mentioned that, thank you. Yeah thank you. I apologize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
And the only thing maybe that I can say that it could potentially be a tailwind as well or not, if the betas that we're
assuming do not come in the way we anticipate, so they're more favorable, so funding cost will go up as much.
That could be a tailwind.

15

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
working through the economy might be assisting sort of rethinking how you guys are underwriting. I know you
mentioned, Brian Doubles, this lower spending in March and lower tax refunds. Could you just talk about those
different dynamics and sort of how it's affecting the way you guys are thinking about underwriting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, sure I'll start on this one, Sanjay. So, I think what's important and we talk about this a lot is that through
what was really the best credit environment in the history of financial services in last two years, we didn't really
take an opportunity to underwrite a lot deeper, and that's important for us because consistency is really important
to our partners. So, in times – really good times like we had the last couple of years, we don't underwrite a lot
deeper and that's really done in the hopes that when things get a little bit uncertain or a little bit worse, that we
don't have to pull back dramatically. That consistency is important to our partners and important to us.
So, we're not at this point anticipating significant underwriting changes. We like our underwriting today. The
consumer is still healthy. We're expecting charge-offs to normalize back into our target range next year. So, what
we're seeing right now is still pretty comfortable in terms of the consumer trends. So, not anticipating anything
significant at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay and then a follow-up is, it sounds like a former partner of yours might be looking for change. I am just
curious of your appetite to take on large portfolios like that specific one, and obviously the stock price is still very
attractive here. I'm just thinking through the trade-offs here and sort of how you guys are looking at the outlook for
portfolio acquisitions and such? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, look nothing to share specifically on that situation. I just don't want to speculate there. We're not party to
that obviously. I would say that we have got a great relationship with Sam's Club going back 25-plus years, great
alignment, great engagement and momentum on that program, but nothing to really speculate on beyond that. I
would say just kind of more generally, we're always in the market for large portfolio acquisitions, startup
opportunities, we've got a very active BD process, big team working on it, and so that's always of interest to us.
What's important there though is we've talked about in the past is you got to have really alignment, you got to
have the right balance with risk and return, and I think that's important particularly in an environment like this
where you're kind of heading into a period of uncertainty. So, we'll continue to stay very disciplined around risk
and return.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on NIM, I understand the expectation on a forward look is it's going to
bounce around, and I get that we're at the high end of the range right now on NIM, but I did want to understand,
A, what kind of rate outlook is baked into your NIM guide; and then B, if the mix shift is going to materially change
as you look through this year from where it was in 1Q? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, good morning, Betsy. So, the answer to the first part of your question, we have a peak Fed funds rate of
5.25%, so one more effective move from here. We do have some reduction again, following the forward curve
towards the latter part of the year, but that has, I'd say, a very small to inconsequential effect on net interest
margin for the full year.
With regard to your second point, as you kind of thing about mix of the business, I don't think you'll see issues,
necessarily, this year with regard to mix impacting the net interest margin. Well, certainly over time, I think if you
think about where the geography is, to the extent Health & Wellness continues to grow at a rapid pace and you
see some of the businesses that are more promotional financing grow, you may see a shift in the revenue.
Profitability exactly the same but maybe a shift out of NIM and the way it comes through with our merchant
discount pricing, but that's not going to be a 2023 issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay and then just as a follow-up, you spoke a little bit about loan growth and you did raise the guide from 8% to
10% to 10-plus percent, but at the same time, you've got, in a reserving discussion, potential tighter lending
standards from the industry. Could you just address how you're thinking about lending standards? And is that – is
the increase in the loan growth that you're looking for – I mean I would assume its within the credit box that you've
got, but maybe you can speak to what's driving that increase in loan growth and how your lending consumers are
playing into the outlook. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, so our underwriting today – again, we're always making some level of refinements really around [ph]
partner, channel, performance (00:46:54) and whether or not we're hitting the right risk adjusted returns. So, we're
constantly looking at that and our credit team is focused on it every day. We're not taking any broad based actions
because we do not see, either on a vintage level performance, the vintages since the start of the pandemic,
they're performing better than 2018 and 2019. So, they're performing well. Again, Brian talked about the
consistency of our underwriting.
So, we didn't kind of come on and off the gas like many other issuers do. So, when we look at the stuff that we
recently put on, it's performing at or better than what we saw pre-pandemic. The pre-pandemic book is performing
consistent with how it kind of entered the pandemic. So, we really don't see a broad based deterioration. When
we look at entry rates and flows, it's not something where we are taking, what I'd say broad based actions –
opening the box or closing the box. Again, we don't use that as really a growth lever like some issuers do, but, for
us, it's going to be much more consistent.
17


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
With regard to how you think about the loan growth being higher, there's two things. One, we are seeing greater
utilization of our cards by consumers, and we are seeing a slightly favorable payment rate. Those two things are
driving most of the growth in the first quarter and we expect that to continue somewhat through the back half of –
or for the remainder of 2023. So, that's how I think about the loan growth being up.
Again, what you may see if the economy does slow faster, what you should see, or you may see, is payment rate
to slow faster and then you can see purchase volume taper down a little bit. Now, again, I think if you look at
dollars here because I think last year [ph] you're going to (00:48:38) start comping the post Omicron period, which
is a tougher comp for all of us. So, again I think about it as being more adoption and utilization of our cards, and
then, two, payment really driving the growth, not underwriting.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the charge-off expectation, I know you kept it unchanged at 4.75% to 5%, and you don't expect it to reach the
more normalized level till 2024. Can you just give us a little more granularity on where you are seeing mounting
stress and in what product areas and vintages specifically? Is it still the more recent vintages? And you did a
continued expansion across income cohorts, I believe you mentioned that earlier, but just want to get a little more
clarity on that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
I wouldn't use the term stresses, I don't think we are seeing stresses in there. I think what we're seeing is the
return to more pre-pandemic levels, and I think what you'll start to see is in the credit grades of the prime and
super-prime customers. They were well below historical averages mainly because they benefited during the
pandemic period whether they got stimulus, lower spending, lower ability to spend, and now they're using up
some of that accumulated savings, they are returning back to what I would say pre-pandemic levels of
performance. That is on performance on payment rate, performance on spending and performance as entry into
delinquency and roll through.
18


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
So, I wouldn't say it's stresses, as I just sat there and say, we see these consumers migrating back to past
behaviors and that's across the portfolio. That's not necessarily in one side of vintages or another. So, that's how I
kind of think about the credit development with regard to that.
With regard to delinquency performance, again what you're seeing right now is a very – a favorable entry rate into
delinquency, you are seeing fairly good front end collections, the back end collections are pretty weak, because
you don't have the normal flows through delinquency yet, what you'd expect to see as entry rates rise a little bit,
your front end fees to maybe deteriorate a little bit and the back-end fees to rise as you put more volume through
the collection channels. But we have not started to see it, we have not seen that yet in our performance, but that's
what we expect to materialize over the coming – remainder of 2023 and into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it, okay. Thank you. And then just going back to Ryan Nash's question on the reserve, just to confirm again
that the addition this quarter was more growth-driven and payment rate driven, and as you look at the outlook, if
the unemployment rate remains, as in your expectation, below the 6% level, you would expect a migration lower
in the reserve ratio from here. That correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, the way – again, just to be clear, the majority of the reserve for the quarter is growth driven. There was an
addition to the macroeconomic overlay that said, listen, you have banking turmoil, there could be a contraction of
credit, some of these institutions which will then have an effect in the economy and onto the consumer. So we
provided for that. Again, the majority of it was growth driven because the assets came in higher than our
expectation.
I think as long as we continue to progress on the macroeconomic assumptions, those qualitative reserves unwind
and offset some of the growth driven provisions that we'll have. So, but again if we track to our macroeconomic
assumptions, there should not be rate driven provisioning going forward, just be growth driven.

Hey, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I guess when you think about the pacing of net charge-offs
given what you've talked about, and then your assumption on the reserve, if you think about timing of wherever
your peak loss rate occurs and the potential for reserve releases, I know you talked about this, but is there a
period of time where you decide hey it's still cloudy out there, we can't release reserves just yet and charge-offs
19

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
are rising, or do you think you release reserves as charge-offs are rising the entire time? I know it's a tough one,
and I got a follow-up thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hi good morning, Dom. What's interesting about CECL is in theory what it tells you is if you see your peak losses
inside of your reasonable supportable period, in theory, you can begin to release reserves prior to peak losses,
which I think is very uncommon for the industry, but that's a byproduct of CECL. So, there could be a situation
where we release reserves even though we have not got the big losses because you'll hit the peak and then begin
to come down in that forecasting period. We haven't seen that yet. We don't contemplate that and how we look at
2023 and will have to get back to you as you think about 2024 and how delinquency plays out for the remainder of
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great, thank you so much. And then just – we haven't talked about the efficiency ratio just yet on the call, and
obviously you guys are seeing some pretty hefty really nice core efficiency ratio gains year-over-year. I'm
wondering about as you think about over the longer term, you'd kind of set up some goals. How kind of the
changes in macroenvironment that you see today, included in some of your reserves, has that changed where the
efficiency ratio trend could go by any chance? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, no, great question. We don't think the current environment changes are long framework of getting down to
that 32% to 33%, which is I think best in class when it comes to efficiency ratio. I think one of the things that Brian
and Margaret did is during the pandemic, they drove us to drive digital efficiencies in our collections and in
sourcing of other things that drove productivity. Again, the efficiency ratio was negatively impacted with the
decline in interest and fee yield, but again as we drive those efficiencies and get operating leverage – and Brian
and I are committed to delivering operating leverage as we step through the periods, that should bring us back
into that long-term framework.
And again, as the macro environment gets tougher, I think the investments we've made digitally with regard to our
collections activities across our entire business will help to bolster that where we can control expenses. This will
be a very different play than what happened back in the Great Financial Crisis where you threw a lot of bodies at
it and just started calling people all day. That's not what would happen even under any form of recession.

David M. Scharf Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in here. First one for Brian Doubles, maybe just a clarification, I
don't believe I heard or read anything in your releases regarding the status of your capital plan that was submitted
last month. Is there any updates you can provide on kind of status, timing and perhaps directional health or
magnitude?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Dave. Why don't I take that question. We did submit our capital plan, it went through our same process,
we actually included some additional stresses given some of the developments in the first quarter into that capital
plan. It was approved by our board and we submitted it to our regulators on target with past years. Again, they go
through that and provide what we believe will a non-objection to that. That non-objection can come anywhere
from later this month into May, based upon their timing and how long it takes to get through that.
So, we don't anticipate given the capital plan of what we put in that, that anything to read into that other than
they're just working through their process and will be back by the later April and May, to kind of as soon as we get
it we'll let people know through that. With regard to the magnitude of it, unfortunately I can't really comment till we
get our non-objection from our regulators.

Yeah, understood. And just as a follow-up question, wondering if there's any color you can provide on your
assessment of competition right now, whether you sense there's been any sort of greater-than-expected pullback
and maybe direct mail marketing by some of those you typically would view as primary competitors, whether just
in general purpose, was it kind of point-of-sale? And I guess along those lines, you noted your kind of higher
quality credits were transacting more frequently at larger average purchase sizes, given all the discussion of
macro uncertainty, is there anything that ever tells you that now is the time to consolidate market share in various
FICO pans, if you see various pullbacks by competitors? Or is the environment pretty stable relative to the last
few quarters?

Yeah, so look. I would say it's still a pretty competitive environment out there. I think it's a little bifurcated, I think
the more established players are still competitive in our space of direct-to-consumer side for a second. So, I think
we're still seeing it as a pretty competitive environment. The one thing that is encouraging now as I think is given
the uncertainty on the horizon, there's pretty good discipline across the more traditional competitors and I think
that's generally the case anytime you enter a period like this. Nobody is factoring in a credit environment like
we've experienced over the last couple of years, I think that's encouraging, so pretty good discipline.
I do think you've seen some of the Fintech players and some of the newer players pull back a bit. I do think direct-
to-consumer, direct mail some of that will pull back a little bit, but generally in our core space, it's still pretty
competitive out there. But with pretty good discipline.
