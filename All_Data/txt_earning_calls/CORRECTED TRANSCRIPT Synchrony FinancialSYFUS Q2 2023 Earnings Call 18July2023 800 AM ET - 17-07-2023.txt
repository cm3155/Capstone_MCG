Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Synchrony delivered strong financial
results, including net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share; return on average assets of 2.1%; and a
return on tangible common equity of 21.7%. Synchrony continued to demonstrate strong growth in financial
performance as consumer behavior reversed to pre-pandemic norms and as our products and value propositions
resonate strongly across our diversified set of platforms and partners.
During the second quarter, we opened 5.9 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 7% on a
core basis. Once again, we set a new record as our $47 billion of purchase volume reached our highest levels

ever for a second quarter. These strong sales continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified products and
platforms.
Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 17% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active
accounts, along with higher spend per active account. The 8% growth in Digital purchase volume was driven by
higher average active accounts and reflected continued momentum in several of our new programs. In Diversified
& Value, purchase volume increased 7%, reflecting higher out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance, and
the continued impact of newer value propositions driving penetration growth.
Lifestyle purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting growth in average transaction values in Outdoor and Luxury.
And in Home & Auto, purchase volume was largely unchanged versus last year, as the benefit of higher average
transaction values and growth in commercial products was largely offset by lower retail traffic and a reduction in
gas prices.
Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 41% of the total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 14% on
a core basis, with several of our newer value propositions continuing to drive elevated growth. Our view into the
consumer informed by the billions of real-time transactional data that we regularly monitor shows continued
normalization in consumer behavior toward pre-pandemic levels, which has progressed in line with our
expectations.
Average transaction frequency continued to grow in the quarter, while average transaction values declined
modestly. This decline, however, was partly attributable to lower gas prices. A deeper dive into our out-of-partner
spend shows continued stability in key discretionary categories such as restaurants and entertainment, as well as
in nondiscretionary categories like grocery and discount stores.
The reduction in average values was noted even among our highest credit quality borrowers, which was also
accompanied by some modest slowing in transaction frequency. Following the trends from previous quarters, our
younger borrowers as well as those in lower credit grades continue to reduce the pace of spend. This quarter,
given the seasonal impact of tax refunds, we saw a small sequential increase in our payment rates, largely driven
by higher credit quality segments. Year-over-year, however, payment rates continued to decline across age and
credit bands.
Meanwhile, the external deposit data we track shows that the average consumer savings balance has declined
approximately 2% from the first quarter, but remain approximately 7% above 2020's average level. So taken
together, the payment, spend and savings trends we're watching suggest that consumers continue to be well
supported by the constructive labor market and relatively healthy balance sheets as they gradually revert to their
pre-pandemic norms.
And as we continue to closely monitor the health of our consumers, we are also advancing the key strategic
priorities of our business to position Synchrony for long-term success. One of our key priorities is the continued
expansion of our multiproduct strategy across partners, distribution channels and markets, allowing us to meet
our customers how and where they want to be met and with a variety of financing solutions that address their
specific financing needs in each interaction.
We recognize that our customers' needs change over time and Synchrony can and should be their financing
partner of choice throughout life stages. Whether applying in person, online or through an app, we leverage our
data and advanced analytics for our digital ecosystem to deliver fast, seamless offers designed to responsibly
support each customer's particular purchase.

For customers who appreciate the simplicity in installment loan with flexible terms and payment schedules,
Synchrony's buy now, pay later solutions have become popular options and are successfully attracting new
accounts and driving deeper engagement. In fact, partners who have launched these products have seen a 29%
lift in new accounts, with over 95% of the sales coming from new customers.
These solutions conveniently integrated into our broader partner relationships and product offerings, and matched
with our deep insights into the consumer, clearly expand our reach beyond our traditional set of customers and
offer our partners another effective tool for engaging with their most loyal shoppers.
Most recently, we announced that our partner At Home selected Synchrony as its exclusive buy now, pay later
provider, integrating this installment product with its existing suite of payment options. Customers can select
Synchrony Pay Later at check out, online and in-store. And thanks to our integrated data and leading underwriting
capabilities, most can be prequalified without impacting their credit score.
At Home joins over 700 of our partners, providers and merchants that now utilize Synchrony's installment suite in
the form of our Pay Later, Allegro and Secured Installment loans. We're excited to further roll out these offerings
across more programs and through our proprietary distribution channels over the coming months.
As Synchrony continues to broaden our product suite and empower these offerings with our dynamic decision
capabilities, we are better able to acquire and deepen relationships with our customers. We see these new
installment products leading to cross-selling opportunities and product upgrades across the business, and helping
partners build lifelong customers.
In campaigns across various portfolios, we have seen a 20% of private label cardholders are eligible for an
upgrade to a Dual Card, which brings higher utility and better value proposition. And our customers respond to
these upgrades, with nearly double the purchase volume and 1.6 times the lifetime value to Synchrony.
For our partners, these deeper relationships translate into more loyal, better engaged shoppers. And so
ultimately, the successful execution of our multiproduct strategy means better experiences for everyone,
reinforcing a dependable and resilient model for all of our stakeholders. As we head into the second half of 2023,
Synchrony is well-positioned to capitalize on these and other new opportunities, while continuing to consistently
deliver for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results demonstrated the power of our
differentiated model. Our broad reach across industries and verticals and the compelling value propositions
offered on our products were key drivers of our resilient purchase volume. These core Synchrony strengths
combined with our disciplined approach to underwriting, our diverse funding model and our RSA arrangements
continue to provide effective offsets to changes in the macroeconomic environment.
On a core basis, ending receivables grew 15% versus last year. This was driven by a combination of
approximately 130 basis points decrease in payment rate and a 6% growth in core purchase volume. Our second
quarter payment rate of 16.8% remains approximately 150 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic
historical average.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Net interest income increased 8% to $4.1 billion, reflecting 19% growth in interest and fees from higher loan
receivables and stronger loan receivable yield, partially offset by the impact of divestitures in the prior-year period.
On a core basis, interest and fees grew 25%, driven by loan receivables growth, higher benchmark rates and a
lower payment rate as credit continues to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels.
Our net interest margin of 14.94% declined 66 basis points as higher funding cost more than offset the benefit of
strong loan yields. More specifically, loan receivable yields grew 145 basis points and contributed 124 basis
points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional 53 basis point to net interest
margin. Offsetting these improvements was higher interest-bearing liability cost, which increased 263 basis points
to 4.04% and reduced net interest margin by 215 basis points.
Finally, our mix of interest-earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 28 basis points as
continued deposit inflows allow us to build liquidity and pre-fund anticipated receivables growth in the second half
of this year.
RSAs of $887 million in the second quarter were 3.85% of average loan receivables. The $240 million decline
from the prior year reflected higher net charge-offs and the impact of portfolios sold in the prior year, partially
offset by higher net interest income. The RSA continues to provide critical alignment with our partners and
stability in Synchrony's risk adjusted returns as demonstrated through this period of credit normalization and
higher funding cost.
Provision for credit losses increased to $1.4 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $287 million reserve
build which was largely driven by growth in loan receivables. The decline in other income was driven by $120
million gain on portfolio sales recorded in the prior-year period. Other expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion,
primarily driven by growth related items as well as operational losses and technology investments.
Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter improved by approximately 220 basis points compared to last year to
35.5%. In total, Synchrony generated second quarter net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share, a
return on average assets of 2.1% and return on tangible common equity of 21.7%.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. As payment behavior continues to revert towards pre-pandemic
historical averages, our delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic
performance. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.84% compared to 2.74% last year, which is approximately 60
basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019.
Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.77% versus 1.22% in the prior year, which is approximately 40 basis points
lower than the second quarter of 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 4.75% versus 2.73% last year, which is
approximately 100 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, where Synchrony's
risk adjusted returns are more fully optimized.
While credit continues to normalize in line with our expectations, we're actively monitoring our portfolio and have
undertaken some proactive targeted actions to position our portfolio into 2024. These actions have been focused
on certain types of inactive accounts as well as segments of the portfolio where we're seeing significant score
migration into non-prime and are unlikely to have a material impact on purchase volume.
Focusing on reserves, our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.34%, down 10
basis points from the 10.44% in the first quarter. The reserve build of $287 million in the quarter was largely

driven by receivables growth. Our provision did not include any material changes in our qualitative reserves or
significant changes in our macroeconomic assumptions.
Turning to slide 10, funding, capital and liquidity continue to be highlights of Synchrony's performance. During the
second quarter, our consumer bank offerings continued to resonate with customers. We experienced positive net
flows each week, culminating in direct deposit growth of $2.3 billion in the first quarter, which was partially offset
by lower broker deposits. Deposits at quarter end represented 84% of our total funding. The remainder of our
funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 6% and 10% of our funding, respectively. We
remain focused on being active issuers in both markets as conditions allow.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.4 billion, up $521 million from last year. As a percent of
total assets, liquidity represented 17.9%, down 198 basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity
portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth.
Focusing on our capital ratios, as a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by
the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis
points in January and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until
January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.
Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the second quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.3%, 290 basis points
lower than last year's levels of 15.2%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% under the CECL transition rules
compared to 16.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 220 basis points to 15.2% and the Tier 1 capital
plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 25% last year.
Continuing on our commitment to robust capital returns, Synchrony announced approval of an incremental $1
billion share repurchase authorization through June of 2024, in addition to the $300 million remaining on the prior
authorization. We also announced our intention to increase the company's common stock dividend by 9% to
$0.25 per share from $0.23 per share beginning in the third quarter.
During the second quarter, we returned $399 million to shareholders, reflecting $300 million of share repurchases
and $99 million of common stock dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had $1 billion remaining in our share
repurchase authorization.
Synchrony will continue to execute on our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions,
regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We'll also continue to seek opportunities to complete our
fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock. We have a strong history of
capital generation and management which is empowered by our resilient business model. Given the uncertainties
in both the macroeconomic environment and the financial services industry, Synchrony remains focused on
actively managing the assets we originate and prudently managing the capital we generate to optimize our long-
term value creation and resiliency.
Finally, please refer to slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full year 2023 outlook. We expect our
ending loan receivables to grow by 10% or more for 2023, reflecting the combined impact of the payment rate
moderation and purchase volume growth. We continue to expect payment rates to normalize, but remain above
pre-pandemic levels through the remainder of this year. We now expect our net interest margin within a range of
15% to 15.15% for the full year.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
The net interest margin in the first half was influenced by higher liquidity due to stronger than anticipated deposits
flows and receivables growth prefunding. Deposit betas also trended better than expected in the first half, but
we're still seeing growing competition for deposits. Our revised full year outlook incorporates these first half trends
as well as the anticipated impacts of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the possibility of
higher deposit betas in the second half of the year.
As a reminder, we expect our net interest margin to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, driven by higher liquidity as we
prefund growth resulting in variation in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest and fee growth partially
offset by rising reversals as credit continues to normalize.
Turning to our credit outlook, we now expect delinquencies to reach pre-pandemic levels during the second half of
2023 versus our previous expectation of it approaching peak in mid-year. Net charge-off should follow similar but
lagged progression through the year. Generally speaking, loss dollars will not reach a fully normalized level until
approximately six months following the peak in delinquencies. Given the slightly more moderate pace of
delinquency normalization, we now expect net charge-offs to trend towards the lower end of our prior outlook
between 4.75% and 4.90%. We continue anticipating losses reaching fully normalized levels on an annual basis
in 2024.
We expect the RSA to trend below our prior outlook and to be between 3.95% and 4.10% of average loan
receivables for the full year. This improved range reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, lower net
interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And given our higher than anticipated growth in the
first half, we now anticipate quarterly operating expenses to trend at approximately $1.15 billion for 2023. We
remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year.
Taken together, Synchrony's differentiated model continues to power resilient financial results to a range of
environments and we look forward to delivering on our commitments as we close out the second half of 2023.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

Brian D. Doubles
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian. Synchrony's differentiated model has positioned the company well for evolving environments. We
consistently power best-in-class experiences for our customers and strong outcomes for our partners even as
their needs change. Our business generates strong capital. We're adept at putting that capital to work in an
effective, prudent manner to deliver sustainable longer term growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. As I look
ahead to the remainder of this year, I am confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver
value to our many stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up
question. We'll take our first question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
With your payment rates still normalizing and purchase volumes relatively stable, what's going to drive somewhat
a bit of a deceleration in your growth from 15% where it's been recently to kind of closer to 10%-plus that you've
talked about for year end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Good morning, Arren, and thanks for the question. I think it's a little bit less about our current period. You
are right, we do anticipate that payment rate continuing to moderate as we move into back end, but be elevated
versus the pre-pandemic period and we do continue to expect to see on a dollar basis strong purchase volume
growth.
I think when you look back at deceleration last year coming out of Omicron and the pandemic period, there was
an acceleration beginning in the second quarter through the end of the year which provides more difficult comps.
So I think when you look at it on a [ph] V basis (00:23:58) and the asset build as payment rate really came off its
high last year, it's just a more difficult comp. I think when you think about the volume we're going to put up here in
the second quarter all the way through the end of the year, I think it's going to be strong when you look at that
performance across all of our sales platforms.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. And then in the Digital and Health & Wellness platforms, both of those were showing continued really
strong growth there, can you provide a little color about within those segments, what's driving the strong growth
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure. Look, I would say we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing across all of our platforms.
You look at receivables up 15% for the company, Health & Wellness leading the charge at 22%, Digital up 18%,
but even Home & Auto up 10% is a really good result and really pacing ahead of our expectations so far this year.
We've talked about in the past, Health & Wellness is one of the platforms where we've made incremental
investments in marketing and products, and so I think you're seeing those investments pay off. Digital, you've
obviously got the benefit of the new programs that sit inside of Digital, all of which are performing really well. So,
we would continue to expect to over-index in those two platforms.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hey, Don.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I was wondering if I could dig in a little bit more what you are seeing in terms of consumer behavior. I know in the
past, you've talked about customer call-ins and what you're hearing in terms of slower wage or working less
hours. Has there been any change there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. I'll start on this one. I think, look, the consumer is still strong. I think there is obviously still spending, excess
savings are coming down a bit, but they're still trending above 2020 levels. So, when you look at having a pretty
strong labor market, the one surprise I'd say so far this year is how resilient the consumer has been, you certainly
see that on the growth side. We just reported our second quarter was a record in terms of purchase volume.
Credit is very much in line with our expectations, maybe a touch better. We're still operating below 2019 levels.
We're below our long-term target of 5.5% to 6%. So, everything we're seeing on the consumer is still pretty
positive.
With that said, we're still operating cautiously. We're monitoring this every hour every day. We're listening to the
calls. I wouldn't say we're hearing anything abnormal. It really is kind of in line with our expectations and as
expected credit will continue to normalize through the balance of this year and into the next.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And on the allowance rate, are you still thinking that sort of steady to may be improving a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks for that, Don. The first half of the year, I think when we look at the reserve provisioning, there really
have been growth from provisions, I think [ph] 2.85% and 2.86% (00:27:08), respectively, for the first quarter and
the second quarter. Again, we continue to expect that migration back down towards CECL day one, I think the
delinquency formation that we have seen has been in line with our expectations. So again, that will trend out over
time. I think the one shift why we haven't changed our macroeconomic assumptions or really things around

student loans, they've just been a little bit slower, which is why I think you see us today talking about getting back
to that pre-pandemic levels of delinquency in mid-second half of this year. So, again, it will migrate, continue to
migrate down as long as we believe the macro backdrop comes in, in line with our expectations.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe to start, I think the first question I had was just on the
regulatory front, specifically thinking around CFPB's late fee rules and also the inquiry into the deferred interest
medical cards. Maybe just talk about your perspective on those issues, where things have shaken out and if
there's any updates to share and how you're just preparing for those eventualities. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure. So let me start on late fees. We've been working on this for over a year now when the initial kind of
proposal came out. We're having very productive conversations with our partners around different offsets. I would
tell you that they clearly understand this is an issue that the entire industry has to deal with. It's likely going to
result in new pricing models and pricing actions across all issuers.
So, we've had those discussions with our partners. I'd say no real surprises [ph] as they're (00:29:05) expecting to
see the things that we're proposing like higher APRs, different types of fees, penalty pricing. And we've also been
having a good dialogue around underwriting. And I think they fully appreciate that without some of these pricing
offsets that a fairly significant portion of the customers that we underwrite today might lose access to credit. And
just to be clear, that's something that we don't want, that's something that they don't want. So, our interests are
very much aligned on that point. Look, at the end of the day, our goal is to protect the partners. We want to offset
the impact here and continue to underwrite the customers that we do today.
And then lastly, I'd just say, look, there's a lot still to be decided here. We expect to see a final rule sometime in
the fourth quarter. It's likely to be litigated. That's I think the consensus at least [ph] what (00:29:56) we're hearing.
But we've had teams focused on this for a while. We're as prepared as we could be. And so we'll just continue to
play through and give you updates as we learn more.
And then what was your second question?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
It was just on the medical, if there's anything to – if you have any comments on the inquiry into the deferred
interest and the medical cards that they've also been talking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, I'd say, first, we're very proud of the CareCredit products that we offer. In our view, CareCredit is not
a medical credit card. The vast majority of what we do there is elective Health & Wellness spend, so 70% of the
business is actually dental and pet care. We worked very hard to ensure that the products are fair and
transparent.
Deferred interest is a product that's been around for decades. We believe our practices are actually industry-
leading. So one positive outcome would be just to level the playing field and bring other issuers kind of up to the
standards and the things that we do every day. So, again, very proud of the product. It's actually one of the
products that we get the absolute best feedback on from customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And then just if I could switch gears on to the credit side, right, your guidance for delinquency rates, and I think
you've talked about consumer being resilient, delinquencies taking a little while to get back to pre-pandemic
levels, which obviously is a good thing, but your guidance talked about it approaching pre-pandemic levels here in
the next, I guess, six months. What happens after that?
I mean, your charge-off comments for 2024 suggest you think delinquencies will stabilize at those pre-pandemic
levels. So maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that that will happen versus going through those pre-
pandemic levels and continuing to [ph] grind higher (00:31:45)? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So I think the way we think about it – and we watch vintage performance, we watch how the
rules kind of come into delinquency, I just want to focus where we are today, right. When you look at average
delinquency in the pre-pandemic period, compare it to the – apply that to the balances today, our 30-plus and 90-
plus are at 87% and 82% of historical levels. And that's just been moving up slightly as we step through each of
the quarters.
I think translating that, that's about 60 basis points lower than 2019 for 30-plus days, 40 basis points lower for 90-
plus days. So I think different than a lot of issuers, we are not at that pre-pandemic delinquency formation yet,
albeit we are continuing to move closer to that in a very measured approach. I think when you think about the loss
rate and what's flowing to loss now, we're at 82% of our midpoint of our underwriting average. So we look at the
formation today and say we feel good about where that is.
When we look at the vintages performances, if I go back to 2018 and 2019, we're not seeing real significant
deterioration in those vintages. They're through their peak loss periods. When we start looking at the pandemic
level vintages, and particularly in the 2021 and 2022, when a lot of issuers, I'd say, adjusted credit standards [ph]
to kind of put it on (00:33:08), those vintages for us are performing in line with our 2018 and 2019 vintages. So we

don't see performance in there or in the back book, if you call it that, that says we're going to be through our
underwriting standards and target range for next year.
I think we've also been – for the first time this year, we did a little bit broader based actions and these were really
around I think de-risking the loss rate for next year. And these are really around accounts that are either inactive
or see significant score migration into non-prime, so not significant. It's unlikely to have a material impact on sales
or credit, but just taking to, what I'd say, more appropriate prudent actions across the portfolio in addition to the
idiosyncratic options that we're doing.
So we feel good with the actions we're taking. We feel good about PRISM and the decision trees that are inside of
PRISM in order to manage credit and adapt quickly to the environment, and the vintage performances are in line
with our expectations. So that sets us up [ph] to how we perform (00:34:10). We'll obviously be back towards the
end of the year and give that [ph] beta (00:34:14) guidance with regard to the full 2024 loss rate. Hopefully, that
gives you some perspective on how we think about it, Mihir.

Hey, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Brian, the second half net interest margin guide being in line with the first half, maybe just talk about what is
driving your updated expectations. I think you mentioned betas could be higher. I'm assuming now you no longer
have rate cuts as per the forward curve. Maybe just talk about what you're assuming for betas, and how do you
think about the puts and takes or the trajectory of the margin over an intermediate term if rates are going to stay
higher for an extended period of time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So, the betas we experienced in the first half of the year, if I break it broadly between
savings and CDs, in the savings we're mid-70s, we're low-90s in CDs. And I think as we step forward into the

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
second half, the one thing that we noticed in the competitive dynamics as we exited out of the second quarter,
Ryan, was a little bit more price increases from competitors and I think that comes from a couple different places.
You have certain of the regional banks that are experiencing outflows relative to commercial deposits, that's
probably twofold. One, them running a little tighter on cash. And two, there is some, I'd say, risk mitigation
strategies that some commercial firms are using. So they are becoming a little bit more competitive for deposits.
You also see some of the big brick-and-mortar institutions who are trying to not have to raise their overall deposit
rate, but using online product in order to raise rates. That dynamic really emerged, I'd say, late May, into June. So
as we think about that mid-70s, low 90s, in our back half assumptions, we have it moving up, call, roughly 10
percentage points that you'd see savings in the mid-80s and you see CDs around a 100%.
I think as you think forward about deposits, generally speaking, assuming that the market remains, what I'd say,
rational, we would expect it to be fairly stable. And then hopefully when you start to seeing rate decreases in the
future that the betas will be [ph] so much like fashion (00:36:40) and we can lower it. I think when we think about
the back half broadly speaking about net interest margin, we should continue to see some tailwinds relative to the
benchmark rates in the first half as they push through the floating portion of our portfolio in the back half. We
continued to see revolve rate increases. Most certainly if you expect the delinquency and losses to kind of come
in line, your revolve rate should push up.
There will be a little bit of offset there from reversals as write-offs kind of rise, but again some tailwinds as we
come through there. And then clearly some of the liquidity we built up in the first half will get deployed. The
second half will also be impacted digitally how liquidity portfolio plays out in some of the wholesale funding that
we're going to do in the second half both in the secured and unsecured market. So hopefully that gives you a
flavor for how we think about the betas and NIM in the second half, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And then, Brian, we're obviously waiting on a handful of potential regulatory changes in the coming months.
Can you maybe just talk about what way if any you think this will impact the way that you think about managing
both capital and liquidity on a go forward basis? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Ryan. So again, Vice Chair Barr has indicated they will put out proposed rules around capital, which again
will have a comment period before a final rule is issued, then a implementation period a couple of years out to
fully transition in. We've obviously been preparing, have run different scenarios relative to the different outcomes
when you think about financial changes [ph] versus (00:38:20) the risk weighted assets or the potential
implications from an operating risk perspective.
So I think we've been contemplating that relative to our capital plans. We have been taking definitive actions. I
think it's manageable for us. I think if the Fed decides to extend some of the long-term debt or TLAC
requirements, based on the rules that exist today, we feel like we're in a good position. We're in surplus positions
in those. So I think we feel good about what potentially can come, but obviously we'll look at rules, we'll evaluate
it, and certainly we'll adapt our business and try to be smarter with regard to changes to the risk weighted assets
and how we optimize it, but we haven't taken actions to date, but we'll be closely monitoring and we'll certainly be
addressing as you move forward.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. We've seen payment rates remain abnormally high for an extended period of time relative to pre-
pandemic levels. And, obviously, loan growth is still fairly robust. I mean, do you expect or do you feel like there is
a fundamental shift in consumer behavior right now relative to what you were experiencing in 2018 and 2019, just
given that these payment rates remain very high and could remain elevated for an extended period of time, just
give us an idea if there was a shift in consumer behavior and what you're seeing today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. So when we look inside payment rate for a second, there is a
couple of different dynamics. Let me start with – we don't see something today that says fundamentally the
business payment rates for us or other issuers will be fundamentally different as we look out, call it, a year from
now or so.
When I look underneath and break into segments, what you're seeing is normalization back to pre-pandemic
levels for the non-prime and lower credit grades. And what's really kind of boosting the payment rate has been
prime customers and super prime customers who have built up excess liquidity during the last couple of years
and they continue to pay at a higher rate than they did pre-pandemic. So we expect those people ultimately to
normalize back to, I'd say, the pre-pandemic period. We're going to have to wait and see whether that happens.
The other dynamic that we have seen, there has been a rise in auto pay which is a good thing for us. So we've
had about 4 percentage point shift up to about 20% of the accounts paying in auto pay. And there, that does help
[ph] venture rate (00:41:08), does help delinquency. It does change a little bit the dynamics on the payment rate,
but that's not something that we think is going to have a material shift. So again, we think this is continuing to be
part of a K-shape recovery, and part of the exit as the pandemic period for now until we get more clarity with
regard to when the excess savings or money that's been accumulated during the pandemic totally burns off for
those higher credits.

Okay. And then maybe just a follow up on the growth. The 10%-plus, right, implies maybe a slowdown from where
we are. Do you anticipate an impact on spending and your sales volume due to this student loan restart and
payments in October? I know you've already made quite a bit of comments on the credit side, but just give us an
idea of your expected impact on the spending side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Kevin, so again we understand the population of people who ask student loans. We understand the
magnitude relative to the amount of loans that they have outstanding or what is in currently in forbearance and
non-forbearance. I think when we look at the population and the mix of that population, first of all, they're very
close to the FICO range we have, I think they're about 10 points different on a Vantage Score, excuse me,
difference. They're within 10 basis points in delinquency.
So they look like the regular book. 46% of those people we've underwritten in pre-pandemic that were making
payments. So, we feel good about their ability to manage the financial situation. So, I wouldn't anticipate an
impact on that when we think about purchase volume as we move into the back of the year and into early next
year. Again, I want to be clear, I tried to mention early on the call, Kevin, I don't think we see purchase on a dollar
basis like decelerating, it just goes back into we had a really tough comp last year for everyone, as you saw this
acceleration coming out of the backside of the pandemic which was pent-up spending in demand both for goods
and services. So, we feel good about the volume. Brian highlighted Health & Wellness and Digital which are really
pulling the engine forward here and we expect that to continue.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Kevin really covered my primary topic, but I'd love to discuss a little bit in
terms of funding. You've alluded to the fact that in the second half of the year, you did look to the secured and
unsecured markets. I'm just curious, realizing that you guys have not faced the issues that some financial
institutions that had related to deposits, whether the events for this year have caused you to at least take down
your sort of target deposit ratio going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Rick. So, no, we have not altered our intended targets for the funding stack. We feel very confident
and very proud of our deposit franchise, which I believe comprise 84% of our funding. As we look at the first half
performance of this year, we are positive on net flows every week, including the weeks where there was the bank
turmoil. So, we feel good about our ability to attract deposits and those deposits when you look at the vintages,

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
we've grown the vintages in the first half of the year back so the customers are sticking with this us. We continue
to have high retention rate with regards to CD. So the stickiness of having essentially 99% retail deposit is really
helping us as we move forward.
Our willingness and desire to tap the wholesale market a very important part of our funding sources. And I think to
some degree when you go longer periods without being into those two markets, it becomes more costly for people
to willing to buy and then underwrite your name. So, having a presence in those markets and continuing to be
active over time, typically when we have debt maturities is going to be important. We also have some maturities in
the back half of the year relative to CDs and things like that, so to try to manage the betas. We're actually seeing
the wholesale market in certain increments makes a lot of intuitive sense for us. So, again, we feel good about the
deposit franchise and that will be again 80-plus-percent of our funding stack as we continue to move forward is
our goal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Hey, Brian, that's very helpful. As you think about the wholesale market, can you talk a little bit in this rate
environment and supply and demand, is there – what is the potential arbitrage in terms of funding versus the
deposit market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Rick, for us, it's really about access. I mean obviously credit spreads are little bit wider than we would like,
given some of the uncertainty and then, well, certainly given some people's, where benchmark rates may go,
even after the Fed meeting later this month. So we less look at it as an arbitrage, more as how do I create a
steady foundation and have the proper mix going forward. And we think to some degree we continue to drive what
we think is very good performance in the business show the credit performance here and show our ability to
manage the regulatory environment that the credit spreads will tighten in over time. But we don't look at it as an
arbitrage. We more look at it as how do I get a balanced funding need in order to really protect the balance sheet
of the company and provide the appropriate liquidity under all situations.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, sure, Sanjay. Look, I would say with a couple exceptions, most of what's in our BD pipeline right now are
smaller startup kind of de novo opportunities which we're really excited about, but obviously take more time to
grow. I think on larger opportunities, obviously, we're very active there as well, but I would also say that's where
we're extremely disciplined as well in terms of risk, return, making sure we've for the right balance, the right
alignment with partners, I think that's just absolutely critical. So, I think you're always going to us steer a little bit
more on small to midsize deals because we just hold the higher deals to or the bigger deals to a higher level of
scrutiny in terms of risk and return and alignment with a partner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Appreciate that. And then I guess follow-up on some of the late fee regulation commentary. I guess what I'm –
what I seem to be hearing is like there might not be a whole lot of move on the safe harbor amount that was
proposed and I'm just curious like as we think about how the adjustments might be made, it's a pretty significant
decline in that rate. I guess what is your operating assumption as you move forward, as you talk to your partners?
I mean is it as low as the safe harbor that's been proposed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, we clearly think that this proposal has a lot of unintended consequences to consumers, even the
small businesses who rely on credit. So we don't agree with $8. We think that $8 is not a deterrent. It's not an
incentive to pay on time. It will restrict credit to some customers, it will make credit more expensive to many
customers. And so we're very active with the rest of the industry in the comment letter process and we would
certainly welcome a higher amount than the $8.
But with that said, we have to prepare for the $8 to go into effect as written right now. And so that's kind of our
base operating assumption. We do think that if the cost calculation were designed differently, we could certainly
substantiate a cost higher than $8. And so that's another angle that we're pursuing here. But we need to have
revenue offsets that we're ready to put in place to offset that, because again our goal is to protect our partners
here and continue to underwrite their customers just like we do today. And so those are the discussions that are
ongoing and those – that's really where we've been focused for the last 10 to 12 months.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Good morning. Regarding the credit actions that you've mentioned you're taking into 2024, given some migration
on the non-prime side, can you give us more color on what portfolios you're seeing this migration and what
actions you're taking, if you can give us a little more detail on that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, John. Obviously, we can't get into specifics with regard to portfolio. But I think broader based, if
you had a credit that was in the, call it, 700 range and you saw a migration of 50 basis points or 60 basis points
into non-prime, we would look at that account. Before, we used to wait and kind of look at it. Now, we look at it in
combination of other factors and decide immediately whether or not we want to reduce the exposure down to the
balance, so a credit line decrease; or two, if it has other attributes that we maybe more uncomfortable with, we do
a credit line closure – account closure on that account. And we do the same thing, effectively, in our inactive
portfolio.
So, these are – [ph] or I'd say it this way (00:51:32), it's not likely to have a material effect next year, [ph] it's
(00:51:37) because these are significant movements into non-prime just because they're not performing the way
they would and they had a very significant movement at the time. So, again not broad based and we only draw
the fact, to be honest with you, John, because we said all our actions have been idiosyncratic. These are, what I'd
say, minor refinements that – but again are more broader based, if we see it anywhere in the portfolio, we're going
to take action. Again, it's really more to derisk next year a little bit, but not something that's likely to have a
material effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it, Brian. All right. Thank you. And then separately, on the expense front, can you give us a little bit more color
on your updated expense outlook? I know you bumped that up a bit and mentioning growth in operating loss. And
so, maybe could you help, give us more color there, maybe break it out and kind of set out what drove the
revision.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Sure. So when we look at growth, I mean obviously the growth for us we raised the guide from the beginning part
of the year. We are seeing opportunities to invest more on the portfolio, Brian highlighted particularly in the Health
& Wellness in CareCredit, the ability for us to lean into that segment a little bit more. We saw opportunities really
to kind of grow [ph] layers (00:52:48) with our Allegro product or others that made sense for us to grow the
portfolio. So we are seeing growth.
We've added some incremental resources around that, which we think drive [ph] it (00:52:57), overall purchase
volume has been a little bit stronger in the first half. But again, we expect to have some variable cost increases as
you're thinking about more active accounts in the back half of the year as we service those accounts. So from a
growth standpoint, those are some of the attributes. And again, ones in which we're going to be – if we find a
good risk adjusted return, we want to lean into this environment from a growth standpoint.
Operational losses, we – the whole industry really benefited the last couple years [ph] as lot of (00:53:28) fraud
migrated to some of the buy now, pay laters, people who may not have had as robust fraud strategies in place. So
we saw abnormally low – and again this is industry-wide – fraud relative to purchase volume, that is migrating
back to what I would say is a more historical level.

This quarter, we did have one particular incident from a partner who had an exposure, which drove the cost up
here a little bit, but there was an RSA offset to it. So, again, we just see more normal migration back to what it
would be in the pre-pandemic periods, not something that we look at and say this is going to become a challenge
for the industry or for us individually, just more the migration back to more normalized levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A

I think the only thing I would add to that is we're clearly getting operating leverage and you saw a pretty good
year-over-year improvement in the efficiency ratio. So that's a key measure for us that, obviously, we're very
focused on.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the RSA
sustainability at these lower run rate levels relative to the longer term guide you have of the 4% to 4.5%, and what
maybe is taking that lower in the 2023 guide with the NCOs going lower as well. Does that reflect something
where maybe your retail partners are a little bit more willing to share in the higher OpEx you're seeing come
through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. The RSA does incorporate expenses and so expenses would flow through to our partners as
well as what's really impacting now is, again, some of the pressure you saw in the net interest margin from
interest-bearing liabilities cost, they flow through to the partner as well. So I think you combine that with credit
normalization and you really get the effect that we have. Again, the 4.00% to 4.25% we started the year, and now
the 3.90% (sic) [3.95%] to 4.15% is at the lower end of our long-term guide. I think again the long-term guide has
a sort of higher net charge-off rate, but higher margin [ph] what you share (00:55:46).
But again, we look at the RSA and when you look at the performance, when obviously we had much lower net
charge-offs and the profitability was higher, the RSA was higher. And now, as you see a little bit of this interest-
bearing liability costs increased, net charge-offs increased, [ph] suddenly (00:56:03) higher expenses, the RSA is

performing like it should and is designed to, where it's a little bit lower than expectation. Again, we updated the
guide to be 3.90% (sic) [3.95%] to 4.15% and we believe that that is for this year a good estimate of where the
performance is going to be and we'll be back. But again, we feel good about the long-term guide. There hasn't
been any fundamental shifts in the sharing of economics with our partners.

And then just in terms of your new account acquisition profile, I know you talked in prior quarters about the
relative tightening you guys have been doing. I'm just wondering if we could get an update on any incremental
actions you've taken over the last three months? And I know you already gave an update on the student loan
repayment side of things, just wondering if that factors into how you're underwriting people today and then maybe
what you're hearing from your folks who are calling in on that repayment starting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Jeff, we haven't taken any broad-based actions with regard to account acquisition. We really look there at
performance against risk-adjusted margin and probability that falls on a partner channel basis. So we've been
making more refinement there, but not broad based actions. So we feel good about it. You got to remember, us
as an issuer, we get selected for credit versus others who do mailings and choose people to apply for credit. So
we have to be hopefully smarter at the time of that decision in which we can gather more data and use data from
our partners, usually data attributes, bringing it to make that smaller decision.
So, the other important point I'd say is during the pandemic period, we really don't open and close the acquisition
lever. We made small adjustments as we see fit, where relative to line assignments, but we try to be consistent
with our partners and really managing exposures to align. So, again, no significant changes on account
acquisition. I think you can see that in the consistency of our new account origination both last year and through
the first half of this year.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...taking my questions. How are you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
First one is, Brian Doubles, I think you gave a little bit more color on the usage of BNPL and I guess the increased
usage of the BNPL product in your portfolio. It sounded like you're emphasizing in a sense as maybe a customer
acquisition tool for some of your counterparties. I'm just wondering with respect to that, is it – I guess, is that the
point now where it effects volumes overall and fee structures and margins overall, and if so, how does the impact
of the BNPL product impact those metrics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, John. So I think just to take a step back, I think just to reiterate, what we think is this long-term
strategy here is the multiproduct and there's real benefits there that our partners are fully realizing now in terms of
how these products can complement each other, right. They don't cannibalize, they actually complement each
other. And they provide choice to both our partner and their customers. And I think that's really important.
So in some partners, this may be a customer acquisition tool, right, where we bring them in on a buy now, pay
later product and then we upgrade them over time and do our revolving product and Dual Card. And when we
look at the lifetime value of that customer, we can make that work. We can make the economics work. So I think
that's kind of the power of this model is that you can make this more attractive to both us and our partners from an
economic standpoint.
One of the things that we've talked about is we've seen a little bit of a shift in that through the pandemic, you saw
partners engaging in buy now, pay later because they need to drive sales, they want to bring in new traffic, new
customers and then they took a little bit of a step back in a higher interest rate environment, so a lot of these
products are actually really expensive and maybe there is a different model here, and that's really the model that
we're employing which is for some customers and some purchases an installment loan make sense. For some
purchases, a revolving product makes more sense.
And so it really is partner by partner in terms of the strategy that we're employing. But the good news is that we
can customize that completely for the partner, given the economic sharing and the arrangements that we have
with them. So we can really make this work in a number of different ways and customize it in a way that is
economically attractive for the partner, but also helps us balance the risk and the return.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's very helpful color. Thanks. And then Brian Wenzel, I think you touched on this, so I apologize for any
redundancy, but maybe quick color on the seasonality of Q3 and Q4 NIM, anything to consider there?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, John, for the question. I think as you think about net interest margin, again, some of the
[indiscernible] (01:01:16) as we begin to build assets going into the back half of the year, plus some of the
tailwinds relative to some of the benchmark rate increases, you should see that that net interest margin tick up a
little bit in the third quarter and then kind of flatten out in the fourth. So – but again, I think short-term, I think you'll
see a little bit of a benefit from where we exit out of 2Q.

Operator: Thank you. We have time for one more question from Dominick Gabriele at Oppenheimer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the debt collection fees that seems
to be going up a little bit. And I was wondering if there is anything we should read into within that line, not just for
Synchrony, but for the general industry when we think about net charge-offs moving forward? And I just have a
follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So what I think about that product, I wouldn't – well, first of all, I'm not sure I can comment for the industry. I
think when we look at it, this represents, we primary originate this through Digital channels. And I see as we push
more into Digital channels, you see a little bit more sign-up as people have the ability to really understand the
products, its terms and conditions and sign up, for number. And two, I think as you see average balances
increasing, you then get a rate impact on the higher balance that's being protected. So again, a product that we
feel good about the benefits that we offer to our consumers and we do it in a way that's transparent to the Digital
channels which obviously we pushed into in the last couple of years a little bit more heavily.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great. Thank you. And if we just talk about expenses a little bit, the incremental expenses between the guidance
numbers, could you just talk about where you're kind of putting on the gas pedal, is it marketing, is it at customer
acquisition or is it tech advancement, how do we think about the incremental spend that drove the increase in run
rate of expenses? Thank you so much.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, I think when we think about where we're putting on expenses, first, it is going
to be in some of the employee cost as we look to people to drive strategic initiatives inside our Health & Wellness
platform and inside really our marketplace and some of the place where we are engaging with the consumer
products. So, some of that requires head count in order to drive some the technology that's in there. There clearly
is a technology component that leans in there as we have contractors who are building capabilities that really
enhance our customers' experience.
And then you are seeing a little bit on the marketing lines, we continue to lean in to some of the direct-to-
consumer businesses inside of Health & Wellness as we try to promote the product to really drive the experience
and manage what is a very difficult healthcare environment for folks as more costs are shifting towards them. So,
it's really across those three levers, employee cost as well as technology and marketing, and you will see again
that normalization of operational losses as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
And we've got a very disciplined approach on that. We make sure that we're getting the right return on those
investments. You're seeing that come through on the top line growth, you're seeing the net effect of that operating
leverage and the efficiency ratio, as I mentioned earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Perfect. Thank you.
