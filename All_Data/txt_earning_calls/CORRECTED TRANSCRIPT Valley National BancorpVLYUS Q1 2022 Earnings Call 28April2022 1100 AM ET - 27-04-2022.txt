With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. I have a few comments to make this morning, and
then we have time to provide some insight on our loan growth and strategic progress. Mike will then discuss the
quarter's financial results in more detail.
In the first quarter of 2022, Valley reported net income of $117 million, earnings per share of $0.27, and return on
average assets of 1.07%. Exclusive of non-core charges, EPS and ROA would have been $0.28 and 1.10%,
respectively. The benefits of our diverse and agile business model and strong balance sheet were evident during
the quarter. Strong organic net interest income growth and robust swap revenues more than offset both a $10
million reduction in PPP income and mortgage banking headwinds. Tangible book value was also preserved as
the March 31 valuation of our relatively modest available for sale portfolio had limited impact on our equity.
Over the last few years, we have made significant investments in both people and technology to capitalize on the
enormous and diverse growth opportunities we have identified. The organic growth results that we continue to
generate justify these investment efforts. Exclusive of PPP, gross loans increased $1.4 billion during the quarter
or over 17% on an annualized basis. These impressive results are a continuation of the success we have seen
over the last year. In the past 12 months, we have generated nearly $4 billion of organic loan growth, representing
a 13% increase from March 31 of 2021.
Tom will provide additional details on our loan growth and strategic efforts in a moment. As it relates to Bank
Leumi, we were very pleased to close the transaction as expected on April 1. Onboarding and integration efforts
are proceeding in line with our expectations, and we are already observing exciting collaboration between the
teams. Leumi generated strong commercial loan growth in the first quarter and non-interest income is running
ahead of schedule.
Importantly, their differentiated technology banking business also has seen a solid increase in deposits since
announcement. The compelling strategic rationale for the transaction is more evident than ever and we are
extremely excited for our collective future.
During my tenure as CEO, Valley has proven the ability to grow both organically and through acquisition. Our
current focus is on successfully integrating Bank Leumi and driving continued organic growth within our combined
organizations. While we strongly believe M&A provides opportunities to accelerate our strategic initiatives, we do
not anticipate being active in the traditional bank M&A market in the near future.
Now, I want to ask Tom to discuss our loan results and what we view as key strategic drivers for our revenue
growth.

Thomas A. Iadanza
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. As Ira mentioned, during the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of non-PPP loan growth. As
expected, growth was primarily concentrated in our commercial segment and was diversified across geographies.
Specifically, CRE growth was split approximately 75/25 between our northern and southern regions. C&I growth
was more balanced at approximately 60/40.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
On the construction side, we saw an increase in advances on previously approved projects. While a sequential
growth in construction loans is strong on an annualized basis, the dollar increase was relatively modest, and this
segment continues to comprise only 6% of our total loan portfolio. We remain optimistic on our prospects for
organic loan growth throughout the year. As of March 31, the loan pipeline was historically high at over $3.5
billion. While the first quarter results benefited from some pull forward, we anticipate generating 2022 loan growth
in the low-double digits.
Over the last few quarters we have discussed our new market expansion efforts and lending hires. We are
pleased to report that as of March 31, these initiatives have contributed $750 million and the $600 million of loans,
respectively. While total deposits were flat during the quarter, we continue to have a diverse set of funding
channels available to us. Specifically, we benefited from meaningful commercial checking account growth over
the last few years. We also continued to grow our niche efforts targeting homeowners associations, cannabis
companies and professional services firms. This enabled us to allow retail CDs to run-off further during the
quarter. Rounding out the revenue discussion, we saw non-interest income improve modestly. Swap revenue was
robust and helped to offset a challenging mortgage banking environment during the quarter. We are working hard
to develop and grow sustainable sources of non-interest income.
During the quarter, our diverse revenue streams helped absorb the headwinds of a volatile market. All in, non-
PPP revenue increased 17% from the first quarter of 2021. We are heading into the second quarter from a
position of strength and expect a combination of loan growth and rising interest rates to contribute to strong
revenue growth throughout through the remainder of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thanks, Tom. As you can tell, we are laser focused on driving organic loan and revenue growth, which we believe
will result in additional positive operating leverage over time. Admittedly, over the last two quarters, we have seen
expense growth outpace revenues. This is due to a combination of proactive investments on our part and broader
external expense pressures seen across the entire industry. We continuously work to limit and offset when
possible growth in expenses and are confident that revenues will accelerate as a result of our commercial lending
engine and the expectation of rising interest rates. We continue to focus on positive operating leverage and
believe this progress will emerge throughout the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to update our guidance and discuss some of the quarter's financial
highlights.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. I will start this morning on slide 5 with an update on certain guidance items that we provided in
January. Due to the exceptional growth generated in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the rest of the
year, we are increasing our 2022 organic loan growth projections to a range of 10% to 12%. As a result of this
higher growth and using the forward curve as of March 31, we now anticipate 2022's net interest income growth of
between 8% and 12%. As a reminder, we project this growth compared to reported 2021 net interest income,
which included approximately $85 million PPP loan interest and fee income.
Slide 6 illustrates Valley's recent net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income increased over $2
million from the linked quarter, despite a $10 million reduction in PPP income. This reflected the benefits of
liquidity deployment into loans, as well as a full quarter's impact from the Westchester Bank acquisition.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Our reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points to 3.16%. Exclusive of PPP however, the margin
increased 1 basis point to 3.11% from 3.10% in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the first quarter's lowered day
count weighed on both recorded and PPP adjusted margin by approximately 5 basis points. Additionally, we saw
the margin expand throughout the quarter as cash was put to work. We anticipate further benefits from rising
interest rates as origination yields expand and our floating loans re-price higher. While lagging deposit costs may
not be easy in the future, our focus on less sensitive commercial operating accounts and the diversity of our
funding sources should provide a relative benefit as rates rise.
Slide 7 details our loan balances and the key drivers of our strong growth during the quarter. As Tom mentioned
earlier, our non-PPP loans increased over $1.4 billion or 4.3% from December 31, 2021. Our growth results
continue to benefit from geographic and asset class diversification. We were also pleased that loan origination
yields increased 9 basis points during the quarter.
Turning to our deposit composition on slide 8, you will see that total deposits were flat as compared to the fourth
quarter. That said, non-interest-bearing and other transaction account balances continue to increase, replacing a
further reduction in our CD balances. You will see that non-interest and transaction accounts comprise 33% and
57% of total deposits, up from 31% and 52% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. During the quarter, our CD
and non-maturity deposit costs declined 4 basis points and 1 basis point, relatively. Over the last few years, our
deposit transition has benefited in part from a focus on commercial operating account originations. The niche
focus areas that Tom mentioned earlier also contributed to the growth in transaction balances during the quarter.
Moving to slide 9, we generated non-interest income of $39 million for the quarter as compared to $38 million in
the fourth quarter and $31 million in the first quarter of 2021. The linked quarter increase reflected higher swap
income and advisory fees, which offset a meaningful compression in mortgage banking income. As the
expectation for higher interest rates accelerated, we saw more customers opting for floating loans with an
associated swap. Mortgage banking results were pressured by both lower sales activity and a negative valuation
mark on our loans held for sale at the end of the quarter.
On slide 10, you can see that our adjusted expenses were over $189 million for the quarter. As depicted in the
waterfall chart, this includes approximately $7 million of expenses related to elevated seasonal factors. A portion
of the non-seasonal expense increase is for investments we have made to position ourselves for the significant
growth that we continue to achieve. That said, we acknowledge that pressures on other business as usual
expenses continue to build. We are working to maximize efficiencies to ensure that more of our anticipated
revenue growth will drop to the bottom line. As a result of our ongoing review of delivery channels, we are
targeting approximately 13 branch locations for closure by the end of the year.
Turning to slide 11, you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses
declined to 1.08% of non-PPP loans at March 31 from 1.11% at December 31. For the second consecutive
quarter, we recognized modest net recoveries. Still, we recorded a $3.5 million provision, largely to account for
the significant growth that we experienced. Non-accrual balances continued to decline in the first quarter, driven
primarily by our CRE and C&I portfolios. While early stage delinquencies ticked up in the quarter, much of the
increase is associated with what we consider non-credit issues. We remain confident in the quality of our
underwriting and our future credit performance.
On slide 12, you can see that tangible book value was flat for the quarter and approximately 7.5% higher than a
year ago. The lack of quarterly tangible book value growth is primarily the result of the modest negative OCI
impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Relative to peers, this headwind was minimized as a result of our relatively small securities portfolios and modest
AFS exposure, which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value preservation. As our loan and securities
growth was primarily funded with excess cash during the quarter, tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio
was effectively flat. However, our risk-based regulatory ratios declined as we replaced cash with loans carrying a
higher risk weight.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Frank [indiscernible]

Good morning, Frank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just on the updated guidance, it seems like the NII growth, the change there is just really a function of the
increased loan growth. Just wondering, is – I would assume the revised guidance has more rate hikes baked in.
And just wondering, given your ALCO positioning, if that's sort of de minimis or how you have that baked into
guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Frank, it's Mike. I'll go ahead and take a stab at this one. We do have seven Fed rate hikes included in our
modeling. And then, also, I would point out that the lower end of our NII guide reflects a potential beta stress test
that while we don't anticipate will actually happen, we want to be prepared for. So we have stress test – stress
tested that range for various beta outcomes, which I think will be the bigger driver down the road.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So, the low end is a few – seems like given where liquidity is in the banking system, you don't really expect
to get to the betas that would be implied by the low end to guide, is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
On the low end, that's correct. Yes.

And then, just on the continuing again just to follow up on the loan growth guide, what the more normalized
utilization rates look like versus where they are now? And just wondering if you have any of that pickup baked into
your expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey. Hey, Frank, it's Tom. We're seeing a slight uptick on the utilization rate from 39% to 40%. So, nothing
material. But with our focused relationship driven C&I and commercial growth, we are seeing an increase in our
committed lines. So, we're going to get a natural real dollar increase, but we haven't baked in anything above that
40% utilization rate.

Good morning.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I want to start piggybacking on one of the Frank's question. So the – you guys obviously updated some of the
revenue guide on the topline. The efficiency guide is unchanged. So I guess just kind of a simple question. I
guess, do you guys have kind of increasing confidence given the updated NII outlook that that's more going to be
towards the below 50% versus at 50% part of that range? Or are there other kind of accelerated expense growth
items or investments we should be mindful of that that might have pay off longer term, but near-term will offset
some of that that that pick up in the top line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I'll take a stab at this one. The guide that we would give is that we're fairly confident with the core run rate being
around $183 million. But as a reminder, I want to make sure everybody knows the first quarter of this year

included the Westchester Bank, which we estimate contributed around $2 million of non-seasonal sequential
increase. So that somewhat overstates the growth rate. But to the degree that there is any expense growth in the
second quarter, we would expect it to be much more modest and obviously to achieve positive operating
leverage. We understand the need to lag that expense growth as our revenue growth accelerates. And so that's
really the strategic imperative.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
And Mike, this is Travis. Just to follow-up on that, and it goes back to Mike's prior response. It will be unchanged
guidance is more tied to the low end of the NII range to be at that beta stress test, that would be otherwise we
would anticipate some improvement to the efficiency ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's helpful. And then, secondly, just on, some of the newer platforms that you guys are, well, I guess
already have gained access to on April 1, like the venture banking side, some of the commercial lending in non,
kind of traditional value markets, maybe that's not the best way to put it, but Miami, Chicago. Curious how those
have performed over the first quarter and, and if there's any kind of notable updates there that are worth
mentioning in terms of the growth profiles of those newer platforms that you guys are bringing on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Mike. I will, I'll kind of explain it. And on the different, our new platforms at Legacy Valley was our entrance
into Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta. And we have seen very strong growth. And keep in mind, a lot of it is
following our existing customers who go into those markets as our starting point. Then, we build, we put feet on
the street, and we start building more locally from there. And we've seen that success first in Philly and now in the
others. When you mentioned Chicago and Miami, and I think you mentioned Los Angeles, I'm not sure, that's
really related to Leumi and the new businesses that we obtained through the Leumi merger. The first quarter, all
of those were active. They had very strong pipelines and origination results, annualized growth for the Leumi
portfolio in total on the loan side with a little over 13%. So, I think that answers your question. Yeah, that's two
different market questions Valley legacy and a new Leumi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. That's great color. Just the only other item I mentioned was just on the venture banking side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Mike, this is Ira. I think as Tom alluded to, they're really not in any of our numbers yet, but we're really excited
about the opportunity that they're going to bring to us. The tech business, as you know, is really focused more on
the deposits from the time of announcement to where we are today. We've seen significant increases north of
30% in those deposits. So we continue to be really excited about what that business is going to bring to us from a
core funding perspective.

Awesome. Helpful. And then, just lastly for me, and I'll step back just on the buyback. I know you guys have
historically had an authorization outstanding. This one seems to be a little bigger or we have a shorter time period
around it. I appreciate your comments on bank M&A near term here. So, is it fair for us to think that with some of
this pullback here and some of the clearly positive outlook you guys have for your business, that that could be
utilized to some degree or with some regularity, or is it not necessarily is that reading too much into it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think you're probably reading a bit too much into it, but I think from a normal governance process perspective, it
absolutely makes sense for us to have a buyback and we haven't had a new one since 2007. So to be able to put
something in with some significant optionality and I think makes a lot of sense for us. And with that said, I think
the priority continues to be to support a strong organic loan growth when we think about the capital utilization.
17% is a tremendous organic growth number. What that may not continue we do anticipate strong organic growth
to continue for Valley and obviously, the best use of capital continues to be for that utilization.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A

Hi, Steve. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, not to beat the dead horse on the NII outlook, but if I look at the loan to deposit ratio, it's near 100. So I would
assume you're going to need to fully fund loan growth with deposit. So one, is that correct? And then, secondly,
what is the range of deposit beta you're assuming at the low and high end of the NII guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So the average for our modeling is 30%. The range on the highest I think maybe gets at about $0.45, Yeah.
Around $0.55, $0.60. So, I mean, those are pretty extreme examples. You're not wrong. Obviously, deposit
growth for the kind of loan engine that we have is really important. And maybe I would remind everybody on the
call today, that's kind of why we have the various delivery channels that we have. And when you look at our

organic growth, both in personal and business accounts, we've grown both every quarter over the last two years.
And maybe it's times like this that it's great to have the retail footprint that we have that makes up roughly a third
of our total funding sources, because in the consumer space, they tend to be a little less rate sensitive. And even
if they are as rate sensitive as the commercial side, it's another avenue, another product offering that we can offer
to meet the needs of this growing balance sheet on the lending side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Steve, I just maybe to add to that a little bit. I think over the last few years, there's been an intense strategic focus
in this organization to diversify the funding source. And our organic loan growth has been a significant priority as
well. For many in the industry, assets have been really the focus. For us the strategic focus has really been on the
liability side in conjunction with the assets we entered into the cannabis market. We work more on HOA market.
Tom talked about some of the areas from the financial perspective, businesses that we've gone after. The shift in
balance sheet from CRE to C&I that brings a lot of deposits as well, has really transformed what the balance
sheet looks like.
And I think you can sort of take a look at what happened from the NIM this quarter, traditionally going from fourth
quarter to first quarter is a challenge for us, especially in a rising interest rate environment. And when you look at
Valley, you historically, say we're CRE reorganized Northeast Bank that would have had a liability sensitive
structure, we're actually asset sensitive. And you saw that in this specific quarter. That's obviously going to bode
well for us as rates continue to rise, but really reflects the changing funding structure of this organization. And we
think there's a lot of optionality for us out there today that wasn't necessarily prevalent a few years ago as to how
we fund this balance sheet without having some of the negative impacts in NIM that maybe we have historically
seen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And Steven, the only thing I'll add to that on our business deposits, the new account openings traditionally over
60% of loan deposits come in as non-interest bearing deposits and they're very sticky deposits. That's been our
focus of growth on a depository side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Maybe one more tidbit that will help. Looking forward, keep in mind, when you use loan to deposit ratio was 75%
in their cost of funds much cheaper than ours. So that that provides a ready source on April 1, a funding to help
fund our loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. But I just want to see and so it sounds like 55% to 60% is the beta assumed at the 8%
growth range. So, to get to the upper end of the NII guide, what's the beta that you would need to achieve to get
to that about?

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then, thank you on that. So Ira, I wanted to ask so if we look at the $750 million of
loans from the expansion to Philly, Atlanta, Nashville, those great to see banks doing what you're doing. But I
always go back to having covered Valley for a long time your predecessor Jerry would always say, the only way
to grow in new markets was to offer a better deal than the banks that were already there. Are you just offering a
better deal? Maybe if you give some color on why you are seeing such strong growth out of this new market so
quickly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's a differentiated approach. We didn't go into these markets largely with setting up an IPO and
saying we're going to be out there offering the best rate in individual market. As Tom alluded to, and maybe you
can provide a little more color, it was really relationship driven as following some of our new customers into there,
and having them really provide sort of what that introduction to some of the other borrowers in this footprints look
like. So, the yields on those for us are right in line with the overall portfolio, but I think a very different perspective
as to how we're looking at a growth in those markets versus maybe what some others are doing but, but Tom,
probably some more color would probably be helpful there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And Ira was right. We entered those markets following our good customers into those. We've maintained the
same margins and yields in those markets. And more importantly, we maintain our underwriting standards in
those markets, stress testing, interest rates and cap rates on all the loans. So, we're not compromising to go in
either on credit standards or on return. And they become deposit. We've been successful in raising deposits in
those markets also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Last question for me, the comment, Ira, that you don't expect to be active in M&A for
traditional banks, at least over the near term. Is that just reflective of there's not many great opportunities out
there today or in the environment stuff of closed deals? Or is this a longer term strategic shift that you're really
announcing to the market today?

I think one of the things I'll try to do as CEO of the organization and the board's really been supportive of is
looking at M&A from a strategic lever perspective. We have a pretty defined approach as to how we think about
growth is going to look like in this organization and from an environment perspective. And there's an opportunity
to layer strategic M&A that really accelerates that growth is something that we prioritized over the last few
transactions that we've done where historically M&A what might have been how do we think about cutting costs
within an acquisition? And then really what is the overall organization look like? So very different approach. For

me, organic growth drives valuation. Organic growth drives our right from an independence perspective. So we
need to create strategic opportunities and partly through M&A to help us create organic growth. I would say today,
there's less options out there that really provide that. But the last couple of deals that we've done have really
provided us amazing organic opportunities today. And you're seeing that with 17% loan growth. If you go back
and look at what the organic loan growth in this organization has been since I took over as CEO, we're – our
[indiscernible] (00:30:18) around 9%. We've been able to do that while doing M&A. We created a juggernaut when
it comes to organic loan growth in this organization, and we're really excited about what those opportunities look
like for us, Steve.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay. So maybe think about it that there's a higher bar today for you to do a traditional bank deal than maybe
what we would have thought about one or two years ago. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think the bar's higher, but I think the type is higher, which to me is more important, right. Doing a deal where
you're just looking at cost saves across an organization, to me, distract sort of what the opportunities are for us.
What is an opportunity from a strategic perspective to lever growth is something we would potentially look at. But
that said, I think we have amazing opportunities today and it's not really a huge priority for us right now.

Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. Good morning, everybody. Hey, wanted to go to the NII guide maybe tackle this a different way.
Throughout the course of this year, I think it's expected that we're in a – see a sequence of Fed fund hikes
potentially 50-50, 50 or 50-50, 25. If I were to look at 4Q 2021 NII versus 4Q 2022 NII, how do you think that
compares? Would it be towards the upper end of the guidance or the lower end the 8% range using kind of
median assumptions on your end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I want to make sure I understand the question correctly. You can see what our previous guide was, which would
be more related to fourth quarter at 5% to 7%. That guide at that time did not incorporate the kind of variability
that I talked about earlier related to various betas, and it's mostly because of the size of projected Fed increases,
right now 25 bps, but maybe 50 bps.

Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And the [indiscernible] (00:32:23) continuing to accelerate the number of them which could drive a higher beta
potentially. So we wanted to make sure that our guide included on the lower end of the guide included the
potential for those higher betas to actually be reality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Let me try it this way. With Leumi, what is the kind of interest rate sensitivity profile in a plus 200 basis point
environment for the combined, you know for the combined organization?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, it would be approximately 9% or 10% positive NII impact. That would be maybe asset sensitivity, though,
but I would just Mat I mean just to try and simplify it right, like the guide that we gave you in January of 5% to 7%
was based on a 12/31 balance sheet and 12/31 curve. Fast forward three months, our starting position on loans is
much higher and we've guided to higher loan growth and then the curve is more beneficial to our NII outlook as
well. So, the range goes up because of those two factors.
The reason that the bottom end of the range, I would say is expanded is because we think it's prudent to provide
a beta shock scenario to the degree there is additional funding pressure beyond what we anticipate. So, we've
told you what our historical betas have been and what goes into our internal modeling. But to be conservative and
appropriate and give the right range of results, that's what the low end of that guide captures.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. I did want to go back to expenses just for a moment. Mike, you had mentioned that the core rate is
$183 million. I just want to make sure when you referenced there being modest growth in the second quarter that
we're basing that off of $183 million mark. And could you give us some idea of that $183 million what the all in
expenses are expected to be for the second quarter, kind of the baseline assumptions with Leumi at that point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
I don't have the Leumi numbers at my fingertips, but I can answer the first part with clarity. Yes, $183 million is the
baseline core expense number for the second quarter, but exclusive of Leumi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Leumi contribute something just on a standalone basis, they would contribute call it $45 million, $47 million
of expenses a quarter. So obviously there are some early stage cost saves that you get that would reduce that
impact.

Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Okay. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. The swap fee income, how sustainable do you think that is or do
you think there is a number of kind of "fence jumpers" that want to get into it prior to rates going higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Matt, it's Tom. I think, there was some acceleration in the first quarter. I think it will return to normalized
levels, which is probably that $8 million to $10 million a quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay. The last one for me is, this quarter, we're not really seeing any signs of credit deterioration across
any of the northeast banks but the one area I continue to get questions on is the health of office. And I was
curious, one, could you just remind us on what your exposure is to office? And then two, are you seeing any sorts
of signs or deterioration on that front? Or do you have kind of concerns with it on a go-forward basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, obviously, it's something that we focus on. Office, our, our office is less than 10% of our total real
estate portfolio and very little, we have minimal in the Manhattan high rise market. Most of our office portfolio is
suburban, non-urban and attracts more towards the growing southeast markets where we're seeing any new
business and any growth. I just want to remind that, that we've always stressed at a much higher cap rate than
some of our competitors have even in the better times. We do not have a large office exposure in general. And it's
very spread out, very diverse. There's a point of contact to our average loan in our, for our new business for first
quarter, average real estate loan was $5.5 million with a 62% weighted average LTV. So, we continue to grow in
a very granular fashion. 65% of our new business production was with existing customers. So, we get a lot of
repeat business from people that have been through these cycles. But what we're very conscious of what's going
on in the office space and very careful in how we proceed there.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe keeping along the credit lines, I know it's a rather a modest pickup, but a
little bit of hiccup or pickup in the early stage delinquencies the narrative noted two loans, just maybe any sort of
granularity you can provide in terms of those inputs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. David, it's Tom here. Is about a $37 million pickup, and that piece $27 million of that is administrative and
they're in a process of being removed. There were two real estate loans that are paying both slow pay, one has at
LTV at below 35%, the other has it LTV in the 70% range. Both are well collateralized it again, we stressed our
cap rates and we underwrite with cap rates that were much higher than I would say our competitors have. So we
don't expect any losses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. And then maybe one final question in terms of new money yields on new originations this quarter, just
curious how that compares to origination yields in the fourth quarter. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Dave. So total origination yields increased 9 basis points during the quarter, I would tell you as we exited
March, I mean, those origination yields ticked up even further. And there just there's a chart on our loan page, the
bottom left chart will show you origination yields over the last couple of quarters, just to put that in context.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
