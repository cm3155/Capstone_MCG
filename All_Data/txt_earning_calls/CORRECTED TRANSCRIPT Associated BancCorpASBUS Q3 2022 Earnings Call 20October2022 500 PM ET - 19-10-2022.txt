Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening,
and I'm joined here today by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. I'd
like to start things off by sharing a few highlights from the quarter and providing a quick update on our strategic
initiatives. From there, Derek will walk through the update on margins, income statement trends and capital, and
then Pat will round us out with an update on credit.
In the past 18 months since I've joined Associated Bank, we have been building a digital-forward growth-focused
strategic path for the company that also plays to our foundational strengths. As we continue to execute against
our plan, we've demonstrated an ability to drive positive operating leverage, improve our ROATCE and serve our
customers more efficiently and effectively.
We've seen promising momentum on several fronts. Since March of 2021, we've expanded our commercial RM
team by 33%. These high-quality additions have helped us drive added loan volume in focused markets like
Milwaukee and Chicago, but they're also helping us drive a full banking relationship that includes deposits and
services such as treasury management.
We've added over $1 billion in high-quality auto loans under our prime / super-prime strategy, and we have
consistent growth in our new asset-based lending and equipment finance verticals, giving us additional leverage
to drive balanced loan growth.
And last month, we officially launched the most significant digital upgrade in our company's history with our new
digital platform. This represents a big step forward for our customer experience, but in many ways, we're just
getting started here. We expect to make regular upgrades going forward with the first enhancements on track for
implementation by year-end; in fact, by the end of this month, empowering us to further expand capabilities and
deepen relationships with our customers.
We're pleased with the momentum we've seen so far, and we're equally committed as ever to maintaining our
discipline around credit quality and expense management. These foundational strengths have been developed
over the course of a decade and will continue to serve as our foundation as we look to deliver enhanced value for
all of our stakeholders.
Turning to the current environment, we have experienced the strength and resilience in our core Midwestern
markets. While unemployment rates have ticked up slightly in recent months, states like Wisconsin and Minnesota
remain well below the national average. The consumer remains healthy while our business customers continue to
pursue growth and expansion opportunities with an increasing awareness of the uncertain macro environment.
Last quarter, we talked about commercial line utilization trends normalizing for the first time in over two years.
This trend has continued in the fall and our customers are actually running slightly above historical average as
they continue to grow and expand. On the consumer front, the housing market has cooled due to high interest
rates, but this environment has allowed us to retain more mortgages on our balance sheet.
We've also seen steady activity in our home equity and auto portfolios. But despite this steady consumer
borrowing activity and healthy consumer spending, our consumer deposit balances grew again during the quarter.
Taken together with the implementation of our initiatives, these trends have allowed us to enjoy another strong
quarter here in Q3. We view this as both a reflection of the health and stability of our core markets, as well as a
sign that our initiatives are resonating in these core markets.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
As we look towards the remainder of the year in 2023, significant macroeconomic and geopolitical question marks
remain, but we put ourselves in a good position to support our customers and drive our stakeholders without
stretching to take additional risk.
With that, I'd like to highlight a few items outlined on slide 2. Our third quarter results reflected strong loan and
deposit growth, expanding margins and stable credit. Amid the continued strength in our markets, the execution of
our initiatives and the impact of rising rates on our asset-sensitive balance sheet, our total net interest income
increased 22% from the prior quarter and 44% year-over-year. Total revenue growth outpaced expense growth by
a wide margin, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and returns on tangible common equity north of
14% for the quarter.
As mentioned, we also continue to see stability on the credit side, which saw just 3 basis points of net charge-offs
in Q3. We did add to our loan loss provision during the quarter, but this was largely driven by the significant loan
volume, as evidenced by our ACLL rate ratio, which held firm at 1.2% quarter-over-quarter.
Now, let me give a little bit more color on our loan dynamics. Slide 3 helps us underscore the broad-based
diversified nature of the loan growth story in 2022. As was the case in Q2, we reported growth in nearly every
major loan vertical here in the third quarter. Residential mortgage led the way as we retained more loans on our
balance sheet in the rising rate environment. But we also posted significant growth in several buckets within our
core CRE, consumer and commercial lines of business.
This broad-based growth reflects the strength of our franchise, but it also highlights the diversifying nature of our
initiatives. This gives us additional levers to pull when we need to drive balanced, diversified growth across the
portfolio over time without feeling like we need to stretch on credit in any area.
As we move to slide 4, we've been able to make significant progress against our initiative loan targets in 2022. In
fact, as of September 30, we've already passed our year-end target for core commercial loan growth and are well
on track to either meet or exceed targets we set for our new ABL, equipment finance and auto verticals.
With respect to core commercial, the growth of our RM base, normalization of line utilization trends and strong
loan demand have combined to more than offset the moderation we expected from PPP and mortgage
warehouse throughout the year, allowing us to surpass our year-end target by September. While we do not
expect to maintain this pace of growth in Q4, pipelines do remain healthy, and we do expect to see some growth
continue into the year-end.
Our new ABL and equipment finance verticals have also gained momentum throughout the year as each team is
fully staffed and continues to develop their respective plans. We remain confident in our ability to hit the $300
million combined target we set for the end of the year.
Turning to consumer lending, the auto team has continued to produce very high-quality loans that help diversify
our consumer book. As I mentioned last quarter, this team joined Associated a little over a year ago, but they're
by no means new to the auto industry. They've decades of experience in a prime / super-prime strategy in a
variety of environments. And I'm confident of the team's ability to hit their $1.4 billion target by year-end, but I'm
just as confident that they're going to get there responsibly without stretching on credit.
We also continue to expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of the year.
As I've stated, the loan growth we've seen in 2022 has been driven by the resilience of our core customers and

disciplined execution of our strategic plan. This gives us a stronger balance sheet in the short term, but it also
gives us more flexibility to pursue high-quality lending opportunities across the spectrum of business units over
the long term without abandoning the credit discipline we've established over the past 12 years.
Now, turning to slide 5, we highlight our deposit trends for the third quarter. Despite inflation and increased
competition in the market, we're pleased to see our deposits grew at an almost 9% annualized rate versus the
prior quarter. This deposit growth has not come by accident. In fact, it's been driven by several strategic actions
we've taken over time to set ourselves up for success. First, we've cultivated a low cost granular deposit over time
by focusing on deepening relationships with customers in our markets. This has led to a high degree of resilience
and stability in our base and has limited our post COVID surge outflows to date.
Second, while I've been pleased with the loan growth we've seen from our strategic initiatives, the core focus of
these initiatives has always been to attract and deepen holistic relationships. On the commercial side in particular,
our efforts to grow our relationship manager base and move to a balanced scorecard model have already resulted
in significant deposit inflows here in the fall.
And third, while much of the growth thus far has been on the commercial side, we also have several consumer
focused strategies already in flight that are expected to bolster our deposit gathering efforts going into 2023.
Examples include our new mass affluent strategy targeting a high potential segment of customers with up to $1
million in investable assets, and our new digital platform, which will fill a gap allowing us to increase acquisition,
retention and deepening across consumer and business banking. We've recognized that generating low-cost
funding is more crucial now than ever, particularly as we look to fund our growth strategies on the lending side.
Based on initiatives in play, we feel confident in our ability to fund the bank at a reasonable cost in 2023 and
beyond.
On slide 6, we show a five quarter trend of our PTPP, as you can see our strong revenue trends and diligent
management of expenses have combined to deliver operating – significant operating leverage growth in 2022. We
remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage in the final quarter of 2022 as well.
So let me pause there. I'm going to hand it over to Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide further
detail on our margin, revenue and income statement trends for the quarter. Derek?

Thanks, Andy. Slide 7, highlights our asset sensitivity and our ability to manage funding costs in the current rising
rate cycle. On the asset side, average earning asset yields have increased significantly in most key categories
over the course of the year. Through September, earning asset yields have increased by 113 basis points, or
roughly 38% of the increase we've seen in Fed funds target rate over the same period reflecting our core asset
sensitivity.
On the liability side, year-to-date interest bearing liability costs have now decreased – increased by 54 basis
points, or roughly 18% of the move in Fed funds target. We continue to lag on funding costs that [ph] raised rise
(13:04) and continue to see our margin expand accordingly throughout the year.
Slide 8 helps us to quantify the acceleration in margin expansion we've seen in recent quarters as a result of
recent loan growth and our structural asset sensitivity. During Q3, our net interest margin expanded by 42 basis
points versus the prior quarter. And on an NII basis, this expansion equated to a $48 million lift to revenue for the
quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
As we get into the homestretch of 2022, we now expect short-term interest rates to rise by 75 basis points
following the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting in November and expect a 50-basis point increase
following the FOMC's December meeting. Based on these assumptions, we now expect our 2022 net interest
income to exceed $935 million.
Moving to slide 9, we recently discussed several factors that have positioned us to benefit from the current rising
rate environment. These factors include our sizeable portfolio of variable rate loans, our reduced reliance on
wholesale network funding, and our ability to lag on deposit betas due to our low cost granular deposit base. We
expect to continue benefiting from these dynamics in the near term.
With that said, we also recognized that the macroeconomic forecast carries significant uncertainty as we look into
2023 and beyond. In order to start managing through this uncertainty and began reducing our interest rate risk,
we executed $850 million of interest rate swaps this quarter. While we don't expect to determine when interest
rates will peak, we do expect to take modest steps over time to continue managing down – managing our
downside interest rate risk.
Shifting to slide 10, non-interest income remains pressured by the mortgage banking and service charge
headwinds we've discussed previously. In the third quarter, modest increases in card based fees and other fee
based revenues partially offset reductions in mortgage banking, service charges and wealth management fees.
As a reminder, we expect to see deposit account fee income moderate beginning in the third quarter based on the
implementation of the OD, NSF changes we announced earlier this year. Also driven by rising rates, mortgage
banking revenue continued to moderate during the third quarter. $6 million of our Q3 non-interest income was
driven by an investment securities gain that allowed us to make contribution to our charitable foundation as we
help strengthen the communities we serve.
Moving to slide 11, third quarter expenses came in at $196 million, with $6 million of the expense driven by the
contribution to our charitable foundation. Year-to-date, expenses have grown by 4% versus the first nine months
of 2021, consistent with our prior guidance. We've continued to scale up investments in people and technology,
but remain committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth.
Elsewhere our efficiency ratio continued to improve in the third quarter. On an FTE basis, we've now decreased
our efficiency ratio by approximately 480 basis points as compared to the same period last year, which reflects
our ability to maintain expense discipline while driving higher revenues. We now expect total non-interest expense
of approximately $740 million to $750 million for 2022.
Moving to slide 12, capital levels have been managed near the lower end of our range, as we continue to support
customer loan growth. Nonetheless, we remain comfortable with our capital levels given our enhanced profitability
profile in 2022. Given current market conditions and the expectation for short-term rates to remain elevated in Q4,
we now expect TCE to end the year in the 7% to 7.25% range. We continue to expect CET1 to end the year
between 9.25% and 9.75%.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.

Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 13. We've utilized the
Moody's August 2022 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline

forecast remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes increasing Fed rate actions and minimal COVID
impact.
On a dollar basis, ACLL at September 30 settled at $333 million, while this figure represents a $15 million
increase from Q2, the build was largely driven by significant growth in our loan portfolios. This dynamic is more
clearly reflected in our ratio of reserves to loans, which has held flat at 1.2% during the quarter.
On slide 14, we highlight our quarterly credit trends. Overall credit metrics remained stable throughout the third
quarter, while non-performing assets and non-accrual loans increased slightly from the prior quarter, they remain
down 21% and 14%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of
potential problem loans were held flat at 7 basis points at quarter end, while our year-to-date net charge offs have
been just $110,000.
Following a net zero provision in the prior quarter and five consecutive net reserve releases prior to that, we
added $17 million of provision in the third quarter. As mentioned, this provision build was largely a function of loan
growth and was not a reflection of credit quality concerns within our portfolio.
As we've discussed previously, the recent growth in our loan portfolios has been driven by investing in our core
business, growing our core relationships and expanding our engagement with customer segments with which we
are very familiar. We've spent more than a decade bolstering the credit foundation of Associated with a disciplined
underwriting culture and a focus on quality.
With that said, we are fully aware of the warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in our portfolio
management with underwriting reflecting elevated inflation, supply chain disruption and labor costs to name just a
few economic concerns, as well as continued interest rate sensitivity analysis across all lines of business.
Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk rates, economic conditions, loan
volumes and other indications of credit quality.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Pat. I'd like to reiterate a couple of points from our discussion this afternoon on slide 15. First, we
remain confident in our ability to drive quality loan growth over the remainder of the year. While we've technically
already achieved our $1.7 billion in total commercial loan growth target for 2022, pipelines remain healthy, and we
expect to see continued growth between now and year-end.
Next, we remain asset sensitive and we expect to continue benefiting from the rising rate environment in the near
term. We now anticipate a 75-basis point increase in November's FOMC meeting and another 50-basis point
increase in December. As such, we expect our full year 2022 net interest income to exceed $935 million.
Lastly, we continue to invest strategically in our initiatives and now expect between $740 million and $750 million
of non-interest expense in 2022. With that said, we will remain disciplined on expenses as we work to continue
delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question today is coming from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Hello, Jared, perhaps your
phone is on mute. Please pick up your handset.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. How are you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So maybe just starting a little bit more broadly, we've heard some other banks today talk about economic activity
slowing in their markets, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Clearly, that doesn't seem to be the case for
you guys. Maybe just talk of what you're hearing more broadly from your client base, how those conversations
have progressed throughout the quarter, and whether or not you're seeing any kind of signs of caution from them
looking to extend borrowings, build operations, whatever may be the case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, look, I think it actually would be the same answer from us. We look at the second quarter and we had record
growth of about $2 billion point-to-point, the third quarter benefited an average loan growth as a result of that
second quarter. But we saw point-to-point growth slow, I believe is right around $1.3 billion. So it's a matter of
scale there. What I would say is, we have seen commercial pipelines peak mid-year and they do seem to be
managing down a little bit. However, they're still on pace, something close to where they were in the first quarter.
So it's hard to determine what the final trend is here, what is seasonal and what is a trend.
But we have seen a little bit of dampening, and we expect that to continue. When we look at increasing our
underwriting variables – interest rate underwriting variables that inherently could dampen a pipeline as we go
forward when you're looking at a deal, perhaps a customer needs to put a little bit more money in or they're
maybe not wanting to do that. On the commercial side, it can also change the cash flow assumptions in the credit.
So it's not a falling off a cliff as much as a dampening situation. For us, we've been able to maintain some
diversified growth, because we've had some strategic initiatives heading into this point in time. But we are hearing
and seeing some discussion of that. And then from a final perspective, I'll say that particularly in Wisconsin and
Minnesota, the economies have remained pretty strong with regards to being heavily manufacturing influence and
that being a pretty strong place in the market. The other piece is, unemployment remained extremely low in those
two markets for the time being. So part of it is initiatives, we have seen some dampening, and part of it is
resilience of the Midwest markets that we are in.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's good color, thanks. Maybe switching to the deposit side, are you able to parse out what portion of the
deposit growth in the quarter is coming from the new lending initiatives? And then as a corollary to that, just given
the continued build out and the growth in those lending initiatives, are you able to kind of buck broader industry
trends in both growing and maintaining deposit balances? Or do you think you'll succumb to some of the same
industry pressures that we've seen elsewhere?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, let me answer the first part of that and I'll turn it over to Derek for the – or I'm going to answer the second
part first and then turn it over to Derek for the other piece. Clearly, the initiatives that we've had going on for quite
some time are having a positive impact for us. So what we're able to do, can you – how much can you say is
strictly from adding an RM, well, when you see your treasury management sales go up by 50% year-over-year,
you get a pretty good idea that you're talking about liquidity management with the customer. That's exactly what
we've seen.
The income from that treasury management is not what changes our income trajectory as much it is the balances
that come with that. When you create a balanced scorecard that incense them to focus on that a year before you
need it, you start to see the resulting trends starting to emerge.
We know on the mass affluent side, which we're starting training for literally this week and full launch by the end
of next month, we know that we're under-indexed in dollars per customer in this mass affluent segment, and we
know that that segment carries about 70% of the deposits of a consumer bank. So in as much as we're under
indexed, getting to average gives us a lift in growth versus the marketplace.
Certainly, we will be impacted by the pressures of the marketplace in some way, shape or form. But coming into
this situation, we have multiple initiatives in our commercial bank, we have multiple initiatives in our consumer
bank. Now, I could go through the entire litany, but when you think about product enhancements and consumer,
marketing shift, spend, change, digital acquisition, sales process, and frankly bringing in a new executives that
has expertise in deposit acquisition that was not on accident. Our new chief marketing and chief product officer
has launched many of these products in the past and once launched, has gotten traction in those. So that's what
gives us some optimism in this category heading into 2023, but we certainly are impacted by the broader market.
Derek, I don't know if you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think you've covered all of it. The only thing I would add is what we saw on the actual quarter was broad,
which is what we've suggested in our discussions, was broad based through the commercial and CRE side of the
business across the products, both end of period and average balance. So you will expect the rest of the
initiatives that Andy referred [indiscernible] (27:25) pull through on the consumer side and carry us through into
next year.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Okay, great. And then just last one for me. It looks like the asset remix with the new loan production is helping to
accelerate NIM trends. Can you disclose what the production rate was in the loan book in the third quarter? And

then just how should we think about net interest margin once the Fed does stop hiking? With the continued remix,
do you see additional NIM expansion opportunities pass that point? Or are we kind of nearing an inflection point
with the Fed moves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think the farthest we're saying is that we're going to continue to remain asset sensitive. I think for this
year, our guidance pretty much lays off what you're likely to expect in terms of further margin expansion, you can
sort of back into that and then the rest is we've laid out, if you look at the table, it talks about asset sensitivity.
That's probably as far as we'll go laying out how much upside we have, which structurally we have quite a bit,
even though we're starting to put in some downside protection. So, I think that's as far as we'll take it, but we feel
very good about it.
What we are concerned about is as we get into later innings is the fact that we have put a hedging program in
place and that we'll start to leg into that over time to protect us from the downside, and that's probably a new
strategy that we'd like to lay out, so that we've got some of this locked in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll also – this is Andy, I'll also make another point, which is more of a reiteration that we had before, which is we
see this as a bit of an S-curve. So you go up and then deposit slowly cash. What we've said was in the last rate
cycle, I believe we're around a 50% beta, because we've changed the structure of our balance sheet and are
about 85% core funded versus wholesale network being about 15% and last time going into the cycle, we're at
33% wholesale network funded. That's what makes us believe that we can keep that beat at about 40% or below
through the cycle. That hasn't changed. It's held very true to what we're seeing.
Now, we're seeing some extraordinary increases from the Fed, unlike many of us have seen in maybe our career
in a short period of time. And that's why we're not giving long-term guidance. I think that we stick to the basics of
where we are and what we're doing and the impact that we're seeing. So right now, it's on track to what we've
given guidance for in the past.

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I think I wanted to take another stab at that margin
question. I guess, the guidance for the fourth quarter or the full year implies somewhere around $267 million of NII
in the fourth quarter. So still up, but much less of a trajectory than in the last couple of quarters? It sounds like

there should still be balance sheet growth into the fourth quarter. But, I think like the $935 million side of the range
would imply not much margin expansion in there? So I guess maybe sort of the puts and takes off, what does it
take to get you to the plus side of the $935 million?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, Scott, thank you for asking that question and making this just continue to be uncomfortable. You get mad at
us if we miss a number. And so we always put a plus at the end of that, $935 million. We have – we're well into
the fourth quarter. We see the trends where we are and we have confidence in the forecast that we have out
there. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves with understanding what the reactions of the customer base could
be. When you have a market that is fluctuating the way it is, we want to make sure that regardless of our actions
for the next two months that we do what we say.
And so we feel very comfortable with that $935 million, I feel very comfortable to put in a plus at the end of that
$935 million. I don't think I would have a lot more color to that than to tell you that, clearly we have had a
relationship manager increase of 33%. That puts us in a unique position to continue to have growth both on the
deposit side and the loan side. And so we think we'll have some growth in the fourth quarter. But there are also
some things on the long-term side of what's happening with permanent money and the take-out of existing
products. And so the question on what gets paid off in the fourth quarter is an open question for us. So we wanted
to make sure we put out a number that we could hit. There could be timing of what gets paid off. We're seeing
historically low paydown – monthly paydowns on residential, which has allowed us to grow and we've seen
significant decrease in production.
So with some of that uncertainty bouncing around on what the payoff side of it is, we've put the plus out there, we
will say that we will expect to grow in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't want to get over my skis on this particular
number, so I'd probably leave it at a $935-million-plus.

Okay, perfect. That context is helpful. So it sounds like [ph] it's as base (32:57) just a very, very conservative
outlook with hopefully that we're on the plus side, fairly easily. So, good. I appreciate that.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Good point. Touché. And then, when we talk about moderating the asset sensitivity, maybe a little more
color regarding what the ultimate goal is in terms of sensitivity one way or the other and if swaps are sort of the
main avenue to get there, in your mind, how much more might it take to get to where you want to be?

Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think the firm's taken the view that we look at the rate of growth and the change of our structural balance sheet
first, and then we take a look at what kind of hedging we want to put afterwards. And we took a first bite at that
because we saw that the fixed rate growth was being matched by the variable rate growth of our loan book. So,

as we look out into our guidance for next year, which we will put out in January, we'll do that same reevaluation.
We'll take a look at what we expect to do structurally with our business and then where the interest rate risk is
sitting and then what we can use in our tool bag to manage that and take some of the downside risk off the table.
So, that sort of lays out the process by which we're going to make that determination and when we're willing to
share that impact. But I don't see us doing anything esoteric. I think we took the first straightforward simple steps
that were available, and I think most people will understand that and be happy about it.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good afternoon. Thanks. Can you speak to the – just the outlook for the loan to deposit ratio, remind us the
targets and where you see that trending over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think we've been shooting to maintain a 95% loan to deposit ratio or less, I would say, plus or minus 2% or
3%. And that's sort of the benchmark we shoot for. We got a little on the high end of that this quarter, but there's
some seasonality involved with that and there's some pull forward of our loan production that we saw. And so,
that's how I would think about it if I'm in your shoes modeling it. As we look out going forward, we'll be pricing our
products and our deposit initiatives to keep that balance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And the other piece of that is not just loan to deposit, but we also think about our funding source and we've been
trying very hard to keep our core to network and wholesale ratio in line. I think you'll notice that we've done that in
the fourth quarter being in at about an 85/15 split. We talked last quarter, somebody said, well, could that go up?
And the answer is, yes, it could go up. It could shift for a short period of time. It could bulge depending on what
asset growth is. Clearly, we saw very large asset growth in the second quarter. We saw the asset growth that was
strong in the third quarter, but decreased and we're seeing a pipeline that has slowly decreased as well. So, our
target is still that remain over time in that 85/15 range as well.

Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We have not provided those spot rates. We've got the quarterly asset yields I think that are on page 7 of the
presentation. And I think that's where we're going to leave it. I think what we did try and lay out was how much
asset sensitivity we still have on the loan side and the deposit side on the interest-bearing liabilities. And I think
that sensitivity, even though we put the hedging program in place, is still relatively high and it still offers lots of
upside.

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Good afternoon, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. So, first question, are all the expected banker hires and the investments you're making in digital, are those
built into your fourth quarter expense outlook? And the reason I ask is I'm just trying to look ahead into that first
quarter and make sure I've got a kind of decent run rate to think about the beginning of next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Fair question. So, clearly, we've been up significantly in our RMs. And the way that I answer that question
really on that front is that if we have a strong performer that becomes available in the market, we're going to hire
them. That's a really valuable commodity in the markets that we serve. And so, I'll put that piece out. So, we
would expect some small level of hiring. We're not going to see anything similar to what we've seen over the past
18 months. We don't need to, frankly. What we've seen is we brought in talented people and we brought them in
throughout the year. And as you know, Terry, it takes some period of time to establish that pipeline and
relationship at the new company. So, we're still benefiting from those hires and we'll benefit from those hires
throughout 2024 without the need to have as significant of investment on that front.
The way that I look at the expense side, we've given the guidance for the year, and I think you can see, we tried
to point out, we had one opportunistic expense in the third quarter. And we had an investment gain that,
specifically, when I saw that gain, an extraordinary gain, I saw an opportunity to put that in our foundation, about a
$6 million expense we pulled through there. That's above what you've seen historically in that space. And you
wouldn't expect those are recurring type of quarterly expenses for us. So, we remain firmly in the space where we
had said we were in the 4% to 5% expense growth range.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
We take very seriously what we're going to look like in 2023. We're all faced with some pressure on increased
cost of doing business. But for us, what we've tried to do is identify cost saves going into the year and we've
pulled a couple of those levers or made those decisions heading into the fourth quarter. So, whether that be some
branch consolidations or decreasing the size of our mortgage business commensurate with the current volume.
So, what I would say is that $6 million we do invest in the foundation, typically about $3 million to $4 million a
year. This is higher than that and it all came in one quarter. So, that is not likely recurring in the fourth quarter at
any similar type of level.
So, that's how I would think of expenses for the rest of this year within that guidance that we gave. And frankly,
we would have been within our prior guidance had I not seen an opportunity to take care of our local markets in a
way that we think is significant and meaningful. So, when I think about that – and we haven't provided guidance
for 2023, but I will tell you, we're not going to say we're going to spend the gain from every basis point of margin
that we're getting. We're going to remain disciplined in that space. And I wouldn't have a change in the expense
outlook based on that.
So, really, when we talked about the digital cost and what we do, what I had explained before is it's more a shift in
spend. So it's a shift from dealing with physical spend to digital spend. And I still feel the same way, and frankly,
pretty enthusiastic about what I've seen in as much as launching a platform in September and following up in
October beginning of November with another asset in that space, and then following up in the first quarter with
another one, because we're able to plug in a fintech into that. So, I know that wasn't your question, but we're able
to do these things as we shift spend from physical to digital and the run rate it is factored in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Appreciate that, Andy. And maybe as a follow-up, one might argue there's risk next year that deposit costs
are higher, wholesale costs are higher. And I guess, my question is, would you be willing to scale back loan
growth if funding just becomes too expensive? And how do you think about that risk and manage that risk? And I
ask that question because when I look on slide 4, you've got $1 billion of commercial growth and another $1
billion of auto finance, which is unique relative to your peers and their need to fund asset growth next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We have a lot of levers that we can consider and are considering. I mean, I'll give you an example. We've
backed off on TPO in the last quarter. I mean, we're down 44% in originations, but we're only down 20% in our
core market residential lending originations. So, that's on purpose. And so, when we think about what we can
slow and how we should look at our businesses, we'll look at all the businesses that are in and we'll bias towards
relationship business. And so, whether that is residential, whether that is commercial with deposits, whether that's
the small business customer that brings deposits, whether that's mass affluent or we go out to market, which can
bring deposits, but the answer is, if need be, we can dampen that growth. What we'll have to do is look at the cost
and the benefit of what we're doing so that we're not running in place on any of those initiatives. But certainly we'll
look at all those levers.

Hey, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just wanted to – just a quick one here on reserves. Curious the contribution, on the qualitative side, of the
ACL, trying to think through how a change in the Moody's economic forecast could impact the overall reserves?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, in terms of the qualitative piece, it's relatively small part of our reserves, about 12% or so. The reserves this
quarter, as we mentioned, were really largely driven by the loan growth we had and really a continued stable
credit metric and credit portfolio. In terms of going forward, we're obviously watching the Moody's forecast, we feel
like we've got a pretty good handle on allocation in terms of our overall ACLL. So, we feel good about where we're
going into next year, we're constantly watching that, obviously, given the macro headwinds that we've been
talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And would you say it's more the reserve calculation for you given that the footprint is more focused
on the regional numbers and more specifically within the states, or do you cast a wider net in terms of the
forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, it's probably a little more weighted to the regional, for sure. I mean, as Andy mentioned, we've got some
pretty good strong numbers coming out of Wisconsin and Minnesota, et cetera. We don't typically get the large
upswings and conversely the large downswings you might see in some of the other markets here in the Midwest.
So, we're definitely using that as a big piece of what we're looking at.
