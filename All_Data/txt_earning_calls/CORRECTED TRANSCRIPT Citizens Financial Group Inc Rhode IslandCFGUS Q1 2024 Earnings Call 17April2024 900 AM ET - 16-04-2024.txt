Thank you, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We were pleased to start the year
with a solid quarter. We continue to play strong defense through an uncertain environment with a CET1 ratio at
10.6%. Our LDR at 81%, our allowance for loan loss ratio of 1.61% and General Office reserves now at 10.6%.
On the P&L, we are still seeing a modest decline in NII though our NIM was stable at 2.91%. Fees ticked up by
3% sequential quarter, led by capital markets and card and expenses were flat. Our credit trends are in-line with
expectations. We repurchased $300 million of shares during the quarter as we free up capital from our Non-Core
rundown.
Our guide for Q2 and full-year remain consistent with our expectations at the outset of the year. Our strategic
initiatives are making good progress. The Private Bank is off to a good start, reaching $2.4 billion in deposits at
quarter-end. We expect momentum to accelerate further over the course of the year. We are also focused on
building out Private Wealth management through further investment in Clarfeld plus several imminent team lift-
outs. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to go well with the fastest growth of any of our regions and
really strong Net Promoter Scores.
Our focus in the commercial bank of serving the middle-market, private capital and key growth verticals has put
us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity, which we expect to build further over the course of the

year. And our TOP 9 program is being executed well, allowing us to self-fund our growth investments while
keeping overall expense growth rate muted. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment,
we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise and we maintain a positive outlook for
Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium-term.
Over the past decade, we have undertaken a major transformation of Citizens. Our Consumer and Commercial
Banking segments are positioned for success and we are now looking to build the premier bank on private bank
and wealth franchise. Our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital liquidity and
funding profile and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. Our
expense base has been tightly managed with AI offering the potential for further breakthroughs. Lots
accomplished with more to do. Clearly exciting times for Citizens.
With that, let me turn it over to John.

Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the year is off to a good start. First quarter
results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment, which supported an
improvement in capital markets, stability in our margin and credit performance that continues to play out largely as
expected. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels near the top of our peer group,
excellent liquidity and a healthy credit reserve position. Importantly, this positions us to execute well against our
multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our Private Bank.
Let me start with some highlights of our first quarter financial results, referencing slides 3 to 6 before I discuss the
details. We generated underlying net income of $395 million for the first quarter and EPS of $0.79. This includes a
negative $0.03 impact from the Private Bank, which is a significant improvement from the $0.11 impact last
quarter, as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected breakeven in 2H 2024.
It also includes the impact of the Non-Core portfolio, which contributed a $0.13 negative impact. While our Non-
Core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it is steadily running off creating a tailwind for performance
going forward.
Our notable items this quarter were $0.14, which primarily consists of an adjustment to the FDIC special
assessment and TOP and other efficiency-related expenses. Excluding these notable items, our underlying
ROTCE for the quarter was 10.6%. Playing prudent defense remains at the top of our priority list and we ended
the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 8.9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out
removal. We also continued to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the first
quarter. Our pro forma LCR strengthened to 120%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1
requirement of 100% and our period-end LDR improved to 81% from 82% in the prior quarter.
On the funding front, we reduced our period-end FHLB borrowings by about $1.8 billion linked quarter to a modest
$2 billion. We also increased our structural funding base with a very successful $1.25 billion senior issuance and
another $1.5 billion auto collateralized issuance during the quarter. And we have another $1 billion of auto-backed
issuance expected to settle this week. This is our fourth issuance and it was executed at our tightest credit
spreads to-date. In addition, we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward.
Credit trends have been performing in-line with our expectations, with NCOs coming in at 50 basis points for the
first quarter. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is up 2 basis points from year-end. This includes the 10.6%
4

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
coverage for General Office, up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter. We are well-positioned for the medium-
term with expected tailwinds to NIM that support a range of 3.25% to 3.4%.
Regarding strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well. We continue to make inroads in the New York
Metro and our latest TOP program is progressing nicely. In addition, we are poised to benefit from an improving
capital markets environment with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions, positioning
us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up.
Next, I'll talk to the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide 7. As expected, NII
is down 3% linked quarter, reflecting a stable margin and a 2% decrease in average interest-earning assets given
lower loan balances and day count.
As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was flat at 2.91% as the combined
benefit of higher asset yields and Non-Core runoff and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the
impact of swaps. As expected, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta remains in the low 50s at 52%. And
although we continue to see deposit migration, the rate of migration is slowing. Overall, our deposit franchise has
performed well with our beta generally intact with peers.
Moving to slide 8, our fees were up 3% linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good
card results. The improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in M&A activity and strong bond
underwriting results. Our capital markets business consistently holds the top 3 middle-market sponsor book
runner position and this quarter we achieved the number one spot. Our deal pipeline remains strong and we
continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter with strong refinancing activity continuing
in the bond market.
In card, we had a nice increase, primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit
cards to Mastercard. Our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter with lower activity in commodities
and FX. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the MSR valuation, net of
hedging, and a modest decline in servicing P&L, partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved
while lock volumes were stable.
On slide 9, we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses, which were stable. We will continue to execute
on our TOP program, which gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives.
On slide 10, period-end and average loans are down 2% linked quarter. This was driven by Non-Core portfolio
runoff and a decline in commercial loans given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand. Our highly
selective approach to lending in this environment, along with exits of lower returning credit-only relationships.
Commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity was
limited in the face of an uncertain market environment.
Next on slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well in deposits. Year-on-year period-end deposits were up $4.2
billion, driven by growth in retail and the Private Bank. Period-end deposits were down slightly linked quarter
given expected seasonal impacts in commercial, largely offset by growth in the Private Bank and retail branch
deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were well-controlled, up 6 basis points, which translates to a 52%
cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 68% of our
deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and approximately 7% of our overall deposits are insured or
secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the
higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories
5

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
continue to moderate and with the contribution of attractive deposits from the Private Bank, noninterest-bearing
deposits are holding steady at about 21% of total deposits.
Moving on to credit on slide 13, net charge-offs were 50 basis points, up 4 basis points linked quarter. This
includes increased commercial charge-offs related to CRE General Office, which were in-line with our
expectations. In retail, we saw a modest seasonal improvement. Nonaccrual loans increased 8% linked quarter
driven by CRE General Office. The continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail, while
other retail categories were stable.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2-
basis point increase from the fourth quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given
Non-Core runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization. The reserve for the $3.4 billion General Office
portfolio represents 10.6% coverage, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left-side of the
page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level. We feel these
assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel
the current coverage is very strong.
Moving to slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6%, and
if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be
8.9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers.
And you can see on slide 16 where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter. Given our strong
capital position, we resumed common share repurchases and including dividends. We returned a total of $497
million to shareholders in the first quarter.
On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including
our Private Bank. First, on slide 17, we have a strong transformed Consumer Bank with a robust and capable
deposit franchise, a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationship-based lending and a
meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our Wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great
progress taking deposit share with retail deposits up 20% year-on-year as we continue building our customer
base in New York Metro.
On slide 18, let me update you on our progress in building a premier Private Bank, taking the opportunity to fill the
void left in the wake of the bank failures last year. Our buildout is going very well and gaining momentum. We are
growing our client base and now have about $2.4 billion of attractive deposits, with roughly 30% noninterest-
bearing. Also, we are now at just over $1 billion of loans and $0.5 billion dollars of investments and continuing to
grow.
We just opened our newest private banking office in Palm Beach, Florida and we are opportunistically adding
talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Clarfeld wealth management business as the
centerpiece of that effort.
Next on slide 19, we have built a formidable full-service Commercial Bank, which consistently punches above its
weight. Our multi-year investments in talent, capabilities and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to
provide life cycle services to middle-market, mid-corporate and sponsor clients in high-growth sectors of the US
economy. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem, as evidenced by our
consistent standing at the top of the sponsor league tables, we are well-positioned to take advantage of a more

constructive capital markets environment and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions
coming through in our results this quarter.
Moving to slide 20, we provide the guide for the second quarter. We expect NII to decrease about 2%.
Noninterest income should be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect noninterest expense to be stable to down
slightly. Net charge-offs are expected to be about 50 basis points and the ACL should continue to benefit from the
Non-Core runoff.
Our CET1 is expected to come in at about 10.5%, with approximately $200 million of share repurchases currently
planned. We are broadly reaffirming our full-year 2024 guide. We expect NII to land within the range of down 6%
to 9% consistent with our January guidance with margin coming in a little better than expected, offsetting the
impact of lower loan demand. The other components of PPNR are also tracking to our January guidance. In
addition, NCOs are trending in-line with our expectations of approximately 50 basis points for the year. Our target
CET1 ratio for 2024 is approximately 10.5% and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of
the external environment and loan growth. Given the change in rate outlook, I wanted to update you on how the
swaps and our Non-Core portfolio are expected to impact NII and NIM, as we look out further in 2024 and
beyond. We've included slide 25 in the appendix, which shows the expected swaps and Non-Core impact through
2027. By 4Q 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the Non-Core
rundown. Looking out further, we expect a significant NII tailwind and NIM benefit from the impact of Non-Core
and swaps over the medium-term given runoff and lower rates. This will be partially offset by the impact of the
asset-sensitive core balance sheet, resulting in a medium-term NIM range of 3.25% to 3.4%.
To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter featuring stable NIM, strong fee performance led by capital markets and
cards, tight expense management and in-line credit performance. We have a series of unique initiatives that are
progressing well. Our Consumer Bank has been transformed. Our Commercial Bank is exceptionally well-
positioned and we aim to build the premier bank-owned Private Bank and Wealth franchise. We enjoy a strong
capital liquidity and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our
strategic initiatives.
Given several tailwinds, combining with continued strong execution, we are confident in our ability to hit our
medium-term of 16% to 18% return target. With that, I will hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe to start off with some of the guidance you broadly reiterated. Can you maybe just flesh out how some of
the expectations have changed, particularly around NII? John, I think you noted you still expect to be in the range
but what are the main drivers to get you there and what would it take to be better than the low-end?
And just as a follow-up on the margin, you held it flat and it sounds like it could be a little bit better. How will the
expectations change relative to the 2.80% to 2.85% and the 2.85% you were expecting at the end of the year?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. I'll go ahead and talk through that. I would say, as you may have heard in some of the opening
remarks, we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good. And – so we do expect net interest
margin to come in a little better, maybe at the high-end of that range rather than where we were at the beginning
of the year. And a lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can depend on the investments we made in the
deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition. And when you look at it, deposit levels
were better in the first quarter than we expected and interest-bearing deposit costs are a little bit better. So, just –
and funding overall when you look at our borrowing mix has improved significantly. So, that's underpinning a lot of
the net interest margin.
And when you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet where you see the front book, back book
dynamic playing out, it's very powerful. And so we're feeling better about NIM trajectory. And I think that's what
you're seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that net interest income range given the confidence around
net interest margin. As you get towards the end of the year, as I mentioned, I think previously we said our guide
would be around 2.80% to 2.85% in that range. I'd say we're probably going to come in at the upper-end of that
range now when we look out, and maybe a tad above. We'll see as it plays out.
And then we'll see the loan, just given where loan demand has started off the year, maybe average loans, maybe
towards the lower end of that original range. But those offset a couple of basis points of NIM equals about 1
percentage point on loans. So, that math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our
guide.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
What could cause it to come in a little better, continued execution of our strategic initiatives. If we see our
execution kind of accelerating across the Private Bank and our other key initiatives on the deposit side and let's
see how the second-half Commercial rebound plays out. We are expecting working capital starting to pick up in
the second-half. We're expecting utilization levels to pick up. We're expecting activity in General, even in the M&A
front and M&A finance to be part of the story in the second-half. And so if that starts a little earlier or comes in a
little stronger, you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original NII guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Which is to add one thing. Ryan, it's Bruce, that the fact that the loan demand is a little light is I think okay
given there's a kind of loop to what we're doing on the deposit side. So, we're not going to chase loan growth. If
therefore there's a little shrinkage in the balance sheet, we can run off our higher cost source of either FHLB
funding or our brokered deposit funding, so we're taking full advantage of that, which is helping bolster the NIM.
The other thing is with less loan growth, you end up freeing more capital and so that gives us the wherewithal to
step up and continue to repurchase stock. And I think our stock has great value here, so we're all-in on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And thanks for all the color. And just maybe as a follow-up, just any color in terms of what you're seeing on
the credit side, which seems to be tracking in-line with your expectations and maybe specific to Office where we
saw a jump in the losses this quarter relative to the past few – maybe just some color on what's driving that? Was
that increased severity? Are you frontloading some losses and when inevitably do you think we could see the
allowance in that portfolio peak? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Let me start and then flip to Don. But I would say there's no real surprises here, Ryan. So, we can basically see
all the Office maturities we've got kind of bespoke, careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we
have. And we've been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a win-win situation. So, we
can come through, getting the best return on our loans and the borrowers can stay with their properties through a
tough environment. And I think that's all going well. So, if you have one quarter where the charge-offs tick up $20
million or the next quarter they go down $15 million, you're going to kind of see some modest variation around
that line.
But basically, to use a colloquialism, the pig is going through the python and it's going to take a few more quarters
for that to fully work its way through but we're not seeing any surprises, which is the good thing about this.
And so Don with that, maybe you could pick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
No. I think that's exactly right. We've taken our General Office from about $4.2 billion to $3.4 billion, so it's actually
coming down nicely and the charge-offs have actually been modest. Most of the charge-offs are what we're
selling out of properties and doing a deal on structures and basically deciding to move on.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
We've had a quite a few paydowns also. So it's not all doom and gloom. But I go back to what Bruce said. It's
name-by-name, property-by-property. We've got our workout teams fully involved. It's kind of playing out exactly
as we expected it to be. If I took myself back a year-and-a-half ago and looked at the Office portfolio, there was a
lot of uncertainty. I think there's a lot more uncertainty now. So, remember, I've got a huge amount of absorption
capacity, [ph] adjusted amount of (25:58) P&L for any losses that are materializing and our reserve levels for the
portfolio are well-above where the severity of losses today have been. So we feel like we're going to work through
this as Bruce said over the next few quarters and begin to pick out the loss levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And just maybe, John, you can add to this, but in terms of where do we go from here, you can see that the
coverage ratio on Office remains high and it's gone from 10.2% reserves to 10.6%. But that rate of increase is
slowing. And so we've been taking the full charge-off through the P&L and holding that reserve in high levels. At
some point, we'll be able to start drawing down on that reserve. So I don't want to make the call on that but just
take note that that build is starting to slow. And so I don't know if it's maybe later this year or beginning of next
year but we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves which will be good
for P&L.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Agree with all that. I just add a point or two. So, we've built into the 10.6% and you'll see it in some of our
slide materials is an expectation of a 71% decline in property values. And that's what drives this 10.6% of reserve
for remaining losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Which is more severe than anything we've seen historically...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...including the great financial recession by a wide margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly. And I think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us, implies another 6% of losses
that we put behind us. So, we've got 10.6% in the reserve. We've charged off about 6%. So you're up over 16% in
terms of coverage. We feel pretty good about it and that's where we think the losses are going to play out. And as
Bruce mentioned, well, the charge-offs themselves, maybe they peak later this year or early next. But we think
we've got the reserves covered.

R. Scott Siefers Q

John, maybe just a thought on how much longer negative deposit migration continues and I think the prevailing
wisdom is that it's slowing. But just curious to hear your updated thoughts on kind of when and why we might
trough?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean we've been saying for a while that things have been decelerating. And I would say our deposit
performance this quarter has been excellent in terms of – versus what we were expecting coming into the year.
So, again deposit levels overall look good. DDA flows and low-cost to high-cost migration overall continuing to
decelerate. And I think we can point to, if you look at where we are, we were at around 21% of DDA at the end of
last year at December 31 and that flattened out. We were at 21% at March 31.
So, DDA for us is stabilizing. And the – however, the low-cost to high-cost again decelerating. And as you – and it
will continue to decelerate. And what we've been indicating is that that's going to continue until you see the first
cut out of the Fed, which is historically what we would expect. But it's getting to the point where it's having a
11


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
diminishing impact on net interest margin. And so when you elevate overall the contribution that our deposit
franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent and we're feeling very good about the trajectory of
DDA stability throughout the rest of 2024 and getting back to growth.
Because when you think about what's idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that we're launching, the
Private Bank noninterest-bearing is accretive to the overall company. We're at maybe around 30% or more and so
that's dragging that number up. So, I think we some exits...

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
[indiscernible] (30:06) New York Metro offers another opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And New York Metro as well is really a good point. So, the combination of those strategic initiatives, we have
some expectation of DDA flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year and that underpins
the net interest margin quite nicely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe Brendan you can add some color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. We've been talking for a couple of years now around how – so much of our deposit book comes
through Consumer that we believe that we've transformed the book to be pure-like or better. And I would just
reiterate that that's what we're seeing. We were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the Consumer
book with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources. We believe we were number one in our peer
set linked quarter on DDA. So, on a relative basis, we still have a lot of confidence that we're outperforming peers
and it's demonstrating the franchise quality that we've built.
When you look at the customer level, customer deposits have actually been quite stable, around $31,000 per
customer. And the remixing of, as John pointed out, is pretty dramatically falling. And I think that's kind of
indicating that the COVID burn-down is beginning to really run its course. So, there may be a little bit more but we
feel pretty good that we're getting kind of the end of that behavioral cycle. When you look at overall deposits, on
an inflation-adjusted basis, they're back to basically pre-COVID. So, I think we're kind of nearing the operating
floors here for Consumer. Given the strength of low-cost deposits that we have had relative to peers, the other
implication is how we're managing interest-bearing deposits.
I do believe that we've peaked in the Consumer segment in Q1 in our cost of funds and why do I believe that? We
had $3 billion in CD rollover in March alone that were priced around 5%. We've retained 75% of those as they
flipped over at materially lower prices between 3% and 4%. So, you start to see the tailwinds building in that you
can imagine the cost of funds in the Consumer segment potentially beginning to reduce. We'll see how it plays out
where rates are at. But I do believe we've sort of peaked here in Q1 and it's really driven by the strength of our
low-cost performance. So, we don't need to chase high interest-bearing cost as a result of that. So I feel really
good about where we're at.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I wanted to like get some additional color on the loan growth commentary. I know you said it could come in at the
low-end of your initial expectation for the year and you cited weaker line utilization at this point. If you could
maybe elaborate a little bit where you see some weakness and what pockets and where do you see some
ultimate strengthening there in terms of timing?
And then, separately, a similar question around your deposit growth expectation. I think for the full-year you had
put it out at around up 1% to 2%. Any additional color you can provide or how you're feeling around that guidance
at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Maybe I'll just start off on loans and others can add. But – I mean, what we're seeing is that utilization coming in a
little lower in the first quarter and [ph] that beta than (00:33:32) was originally expected. But nevertheless we still
see in the second-half, the interest around putting some working capital to work and Commercial activity starting
to pick up is really going to drive that reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the second-half.
On the retail side of things, we're still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and HELOC and in the
Private Bank where we've gotten a nice start in terms of which is mostly a Commercial lending-driven amount of
activity in the subscription line space and we see that picking up. So, all-in, 1H playing out about as expected,
meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans but we had expected that would be the case. And then the
pickup in the second-half will be coming out of the Commercial business and Private Bank. Maybe any other
color?

That was well-said. Don, any color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. No. I think it's across the board on the Commercial side and part of it is due to the booming bond markets.
We're seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines. And then I
think there's a positive to it also, not for a loan levels but customers are running with lower leverage levels
because they've been concerned about the economy. We're seeing a broad, more positive view of the overall
economy across really wide swaths of our client base, so that would indicate that they're going to get more active
in things like plant construction, working capital growth, M&A. And so that should drive some bounce back in the
back-half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Anything from you, Brendan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The only thing I would add is maybe just strategically that there's a lot of ins-and-outs under the covers. So,
as we run down auto by essentially $1 billion a quarter and other Non-Core, it's getting replaced with high
relationship, higher returning asset growth, whether it's on HELOC side or the Private Bank. So, the headline
numbers that you see around our loan growth, what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that
we're doing around a handful of areas to have more durable, sticky revenue sources that are going to create more
cross-sell around fees and other things over time. So, we're pleased with how that's going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Now, you had a question about deposits. On the deposit side of things, in the first quarter, as I mentioned before,
we saw DDA flatten out for the first time in many quarters. So that is really good to see. We also saw low cost
flatten out. So, overall, we were at 42% last quarter in low-cost. We're at 42% this quarter in low-cost plus DDA.
So, the deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable and from a quantity level of deposits at the
end of the quarter came in higher than expected. That's driven by just strong execution and our strategic
initiatives contributing.
As we mentioned earlier, New York Metro and Private Bank, along with the blocking-and-tackling that Brendan
and Don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise. And so all of those investments are paying
off and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in the second-half of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, John. Thanks for that. And then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Just one last quick piece of color. Is that very pleased to see Private Bank now has had kind of two quarters with
$1 billion-plus of deposit growth and we certainly think that that's sustainable and could even accelerate. So, the
ship has landed and we're off to a great start. We expect that to continue and even accelerate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. Thanks, Bruce. And then on the capital front, good to see the resumption in buybacks, the $300
million in repurchases this quarter. With CET1 here at around 10.6% or 8.9% when you dial in the AOCI scenario,
how do you look at the likelihood of incremental buybacks from here in terms of pace of buybacks, do you think
that that could be reasonable given where you're sitting right now on CET1? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think this capital position that we have generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility.
When you think about our capital waterfall, I mean our top priority is to put capital to work, that is to support and
clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time. And that's really what we want to do and that we're
expecting to do. And that's what capital allows us that flexibility. It also cushions against uncertainties. And so
there have been a number -we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients
but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position.
When you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital, we support our dividend, of course that's top of
the list. And then if we're left with elevated capital levels, then we're able to give it back to shareholders, which we
did in the first quarter. We're planning to do that here in the second quarter and that flexibility will continue into the
second-half. So, as we monitor loan demand and the macro, that will play into the trajectory of buybacks in the
second-half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have, let's say, a front-loaded plan this year
because there's less loan growth. In fact, there's loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around and we
start to see loan growth in the second-half of the year. That would, by definition, mean we need capital to support
the loan growth and there'd be less capacity for share repurchases. But, anyway, we gave the – you saw the $300
million number in the first quarter. John mentioned $200 million in the second quarter. And then we'll see where
we get to in the second-half. If the loan growth fully doesn't materialize, we can actually just turn around and keep
repurchasing stock.

Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winters (sic) [Peter Winter] with D.A. Davidson.
Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. You guys maintained the net charge-off guidance for the year. But if we assume no rate
cuts this year, could it lead to higher net charge-offs than forecasting just given kind of no relief on debt service
coverage ratios or loans coming up for renewal at higher rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, what I would say on that is that the broad credit quality is still very good. So, if you look at our C&I book
that's in really good shape. Companies weathered the pandemic and leaned their business models locked in
lower cost financing. They're doing more of that now early in the year. So, we don't really see hotspots even with
kind of a higher-for-longer scenario in C&I.
Similarly, in Consumer, we're still in very good shape. The Consumer is benefiting from still strong liquidity levels,
a strong labor market. And so we haven't seen any adverse migrations, in delinquencies or NPAs or anything like
that. So, that's the bulk of the loan portfolio. If you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the General
Office in particular, that's relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book. And I think there's potentially
some trends. We're watching the reports that return-to-office is picking up and so maybe there's a little counter-
trend in Office that offsets the kind of additional burden of the higher-for-longer. But I think that the margin is not
going to change that charge-off number materially.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I – Peter, I'll just second that from my side. We made no assumptions in our forecast that we're going to
benefit from lower rates because we just didn't know. And that's our credit policy. We don't go out on the future
curve. We run all our scenarios based on where rates are today. So, I think we've got a peak-ish kind of rate
environment. If it lasts another couple of quarters or even another year, I don't think it's going to make a material
difference to the way we forecast charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The only point I would add on Consumer is that our delinquency levels are actually net down year-over-year, Q1-
over-Q1, led mostly by resi. But we're seeing really no signs of stress on the book, as Bruce pointed out. So, I feel
really good and even at a higher-for-longer that – unless there's a big economic shock that we're in really good
shape.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
And I just – quickly, just a follow-up on Offices. I guess, I believe that more than half of the maturities on Office
happened this year. So, do you think net charge-offs could peak towards the end of this year, maybe early next
year and then start to trend lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
It's really hard to forecast that. I think they will be early next year or late this year probably. But it depends how
much we extend, how the negotiations go, how much capital is put into some of these transactions and working
through the book, loan-by-loan. It's – I don't have the crystal ball to say exactly when the peak is but I would go
back to what I said before is we're comfortable how it's kind of progressing and it's progressing according to our
expectations.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a question on the fee side. It's really nice to see the capital markets improvement as
you had been thinking, as we're seeing more broadly. I'm just wondering, a couple line items went well, a couple
items kind of went backwards. Just wondering just how you're thinking about the fee progression, the drivers and
what's your pipeline look like relative to the better start point here for the first quarter capital markets? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start off and then others can jump in here. But – I mean, the drivers, I mean, you look at the big three for
us; capital markets, card fees and wealth trust and investment services are all trending well and we expect to be
significant contributors in 2024. So, each of those businesses have had significant strategic investment over the
years and even more recently. So, it's really nice to see the investments made in the capital markets business
come to fruition. We had a good strong quarter in the first quarter. Number one in the league tables on the
sponsor side, a big rebound from the fourth quarter. And early in the second quarter, the pace of activity has
continued and we feel very good about the trends there, not only for 2Q but for the full-year.
In the card business, we've made a strategic conversion to Mastercard and that's driving a number of positive
developments there. And in the Wealth business, as you know, all of the advisor hires, the Clarfeld acquisition
from a number of years ago are all coming together along with the Private Bank to drive those flows throughout
2024. So, we're feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I would just say, to your point Ken also, there were – those three strong areas and then we had a little bit of
weakness in some other areas; service charges, mortgage, the global markets, FX, and interest rate lines were a
little below our expectations. The good news there is there's nothing structural that we worry about. I think we'll
see bounce backs over the rest of the year, which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that we'll
maintain strong fee performance for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just one more follow-up on the NII and the swaps. I'm just looking at your – pages 25 and 26
from the deck. It's pretty clear that you're saying the increases you've made to the swap book are all incorporated
in the guidance, so that first quarter to fourth quarter. $35 million cumulative net interest income impact, is that
inclusive of everything that is both like active as of now and then will prospectively still come on as the year
progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Yeah. It is. And so what that is, that $35 million is made up of about $15 million, primarily driven from active
swaps that are outstanding. So, there's about $20 billion notional of active swaps outstanding, that grows to about
$30 billion by 4Q. That's incorporated into that number. But then it's offset by the positive benefit from Non-Core
of about, call it, $17 million or so, or $15 million to $20 million coming from Non-Core. And that gets you to the
$35 million drag. But really when you play it out for the rest of the year, again, broadly, net interest margin trends
are coming in a little better. Incorporating all of our swap activity, what you see on page 25 is just the receive-fixed
swaps. We actually have pay-fixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this as well as of course
everything that's happening in the core balance sheet. So, you got to kind of think at the broadest sense that NIM
trends are actually coming in a little better. And then as you get out to later years, you start getting all of this
tailwind is really baked in and you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute. It gets to the
point where you get out into 2026 and 2027 that a majority of – a super majority, if you will, of the tailwinds are
actually baked in and aren't rate-dependent. But you got that right in terms of the 4Q components, that
incorporates everything on the receive-fixed swap side plus Non-Core.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would just add a color there Ken is I think coming into the year people were concerned about that step-up
that we had forward starting swaps in Q2 and then more in Q3. The guide that we're giving and our confidence in
the NIM outlook incorporate that. So, we're able to absorb that because higher-for-longer is better for the core
18

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
balance sheet. We have some pay-fixed swaps. We do it in the securities book. So, we're able to absorb kind of
that step-up in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the NIM outlook for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's great, Bruce. And if I can just bring that all together. So, you broadly affirmed your broader guidance
of down 6% to down 9% and we kind of know the first quarter and have the second quarter outlook. So, what
would be the biggest swing factors within that range based on all these points that you're making about the NIM
coming in better and now knowing more of this detail about how the swaps will work?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. To me, it's really volume would be the keys to where we land in that range. So, do we actually see that
strong growth in the Private Bank accelerating that could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding?
And then the spreads that they're making on their loans is also very attractive. So, that's totally accretive to front
book, back book.
Do we see the growth in Commercial that we expect come in and I think we, based on our kind of pipelines and
our conversations with our customers and also a feeling that the sponsor community right now, there's been a lot
of pull-forward and refinancing but I think you're going to start to see some more new money deals in the second-
half of the year. So, I think those volume factors will have a big impact. But the way we kind of see it, looking out
the window today, we're highly confident that those things will materialize.
I don't know John if you want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I agree with all that. I would say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand, we still think that range is
good. Maybe it comes at a higher-end versus the lower-end. But I mean think that's a swing factor.
All the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well. Our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is
underpinning the net interest margin. I would hasten to add that those pay-fixed swaps that we added last quarter
in 1Q and also in 4Q have really driven a really nice uptake in the securities yields. You see the securities yields
up almost 40 basis points in the first quarter. And that's offsetting. That's a huge component of our balance sheet.
And that's a big driver.
And then I should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well, where we're seeing front
book, back book on the loan side that is in the range of 300 basis points in the first quarter. And you're getting
front book back on the securities book of around 200 basis points. So, there are good dynamics in the core
balance sheet and all of the swaps are baked in.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But I'm curious when you talk about kind of this
medium-term net interest margin, what are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet? And I guess,
specifically, like do you think the overall balance sheet will grow, or is there the remixing. Clearly, you're running
off the Non-Core book, growing the Private Bank. But do you envision kind of net balance sheet growth as you
look out the next few years? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say that we do expect the balance sheet to grow. It's – I think we do have a balance sheet optimization
program that's turning over a certain portion of the portfolio. But when you look at the grand total of the initiatives
that we're putting in place, you get – I think you see interest-earning assets will be growing in the second-half of
the year and as you get out over the medium term. So, I think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow
and that's our expectation.

Yeah. I would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting
on repositioning. And then we start to see the Private Bank growth and Commercial Bank, as we discussed, start
to kick in. So, we should see net growth already in the second-half of the year and then kind of looking out 2025
to 2027, we would expect, in a strong economy, that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates. Again
being selective where we play, focusing on primary relationships and primacy. But there's no reason we couldn't
grow back at nominal GDP the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic. And that plays into
Matt the delivery of positive operating leverage, which is part of how you get your return on equity up. And so
that's the model we'd like to get back to.

Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Thomas Leddy calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back to capital deployment quickly,
you guys were pretty busy in 2023 in terms of strategic actions. Can you update us on how you're thinking about
further investment opportunities for the franchise and how you guys prioritize organic growth versus team lift-outs
or even outright M&A?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, I would say that right now we have a very full plate in terms of the things that we're investing in, the
organic growth initiatives we have. So, I would not – we're not really looking much at inorganic situations or
opportunities and so we want to just stay focused on great execution. There's a big payoff for getting these
initiatives right and they're all trying to [ph] fund (00:55:20) the trend line.
I would say team lift-outs you mentioned is something that we're hinting at, at this point. Because while we have
the Private Bank in place and we have Clarfeld as part of the Private Wealth complex, we need to scale up our
Private Wealth capabilities into a large extent. And so we are having discussions with teams and you can watch
this space because I think you'll start to see us build that part of the business out. But again it will be prudent.
We'll treat them like they're kind of M&A transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and they're good
cultural fits. But that's kind of the only thing I would say that we're looking kind of outside. And to some extent
that's organic. You could argue whether that's organic or whether it's acquisition-like but we're kind of using the
same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals.
I don't Brendan, if you want to add any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Maybe two quick points. One is that I just said the interest in Citizens from a wealth management perspective is at
a high like we've never seen before. So, we're talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big
brands in the United States. So, we're going to be very selective. But the interest in what we're doing here is quite
unique and distinctive, so we expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our Wealth strategy.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
The point around capital that you mentioned, I'll just – given that we're mentally potentially thinking about the
return metrics like we would in M&A deal, keep in mind that a lift-out or what we do with the Private Bank really is
a very de minimis impact on capital. And so that's why that when you look – when we talk about the breakeven of
the Private Bank being second-half of this year, it's really just getting through the expense guarantees and getting
the revenue throughput. So, it has a very de minimis impact on capital. And the same will be true on Wealth lift-
outs where the teams we bring onboard, it will be a much more of expense guarantee mindset and getting them
through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Thank you. And then just separately on loan growth. C&I demand has obviously
been pretty tepid despite pretty healthy growth in the economy as measured by real GDP. Do you think that lack
of C&I loan demand is being driven by just general customer caution? Or are you guys seeing more competition
from non-bank players like the private credit market and others?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think it's just a general caution about what's going to happen in the economy, what's going to happen with
rates and I think most of our companies have had good years but they're still expressing caution. So, we're
actually not losing business to private credit. It's interesting. We're actually – it's coming the other way because
there's been opportunities to take out loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank,
syndicated lending market, refinance those and kind of lock in lower cost financing. So, that's been a big part of
the story here in the first quarter and it's continuing into the second quarter.
Don, [ph] any color (00:58:37)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that's right. I think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leveraged buyout market,
which we don't hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway, so they're a source of distribution for us. So, we've
actually done a couple deals in the first quarter where we've distributed into the private credit market. So, it
doesn't have a balance sheet impact and it helps drive some of our fee lines.

Operator: Your next question will come from line – pardon me. The line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.
Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Earlier you mentioned that the flows were a major driving swing factor of that NII guide and I know you mentioned
expecting a little less loan growth this year but you mentioned possibly hitting the better end of that NII range. If,
for whatever reason, net loan growth doesn't materialize in the back-half and C&I growth only ends up filling in for
the runoff that you're expecting, can you still hit that NII guide for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes. I mean, I would say that we're still confident in the range. And so if things break our way, we could be at the
better side of that range, if they don't, we could be at the lower end of that range. So, I'd still kind of use that as
the guardrails you'd have to have kind of a quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I agree. And just to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Just to reiterate that point, what we've been saying is that we have an expectation that we'll come in at the better
end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that we're seeing and the performance we were able
to generate in the first quarter. So, you would see us being at the upper-end of that range, maybe a tad better on
net interest margin. That's offsetting the fact that there's some lighter loan demand that we're also seeing that.
You put those together and we're right down the middle there in terms of that range. And we have got, back to the
point Bruce just made, and that's our base case now that we're updating. And there could be puts-and-takes to
that depending upon the volume point that Bruce made earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this earlier but just kind of drilling down on the NIM discussion. Just looking
at this quarter, curious on C&I yields dropped around 36 bps quarter-over-quarter. I didn't think this is a heavy
swap onboarding this quarter. But just curious where we're looking at that maybe in the next quarter before the
swaps come on in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, really what's going on as you've hit it. I would say just broadly, I would try to make the point that all
the swaps are incorporated into the NIM guide. And when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan
book that the front book, back book is driving an increase in loan yields ex-swaps. So that's the first point.
As it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint, why there is a negative impact
from the swap standpoint is that there was a mix shift. We had – the swap notionals didn't change much but we
had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receive. And
that overall, that net receive rate fell in the quarter and that's why you ended up with that negative impact just on
that line itself. But again, overall, net interest margin was flat for the quarter. And when you put it all together with
all the components, we had a quite a strong net interest margin performance even incorporating that swap drag.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. I agree. And then you talked about the securities book, both the front book, back book and then the pay
floaters coming out. But just curious your outlook for the growth of the securities book going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think we've gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year and that's basically
largely done. And so where you see the securities book right now, as a percentage of our overall interest-earning
assets, is about where we'll be over time. As we grow loans, we'll probably grow securities and cash on a similar
mix basis from a volume standpoint. But the percentage of cash and securities to overall interest-earning assets
at the end of the first quarter is about where we'll be for the rest of the year.
And I would hasten to add that when you look at that, that's reflective of our deposit franchise and being primarily
Consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers. And then if you if
you crank it all through the way the Fed looks at standardized Category 1 banks, our LCR incorporating all of that

at March 31 was 120%, which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint. And that plays through based upon
the balance sheet mix overall, including cash and securities.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Maybe as a follow-up to the last question, is there any change in how you're thinking through positioning in the
medium-term with the expectation for fewer rate cuts coming through? So, with loan growth being a little bit
weaker right now, deposit growth being pretty solid as you noted, are you willing to put on a little bit more duration
on the securities side?
And, separately, has it got cheaper to put in some downside protection on NIM as you look into 2025 and 2026?
And is that something you're considering right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say, on the securities side, I'd say there's a couple of objectives being addressed and that's the
interplay between capital and liquidity and interest rate risk management. So, what we did over the last couple of
quarters is we've added $7 billion of pay-fixed swaps. That's paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates
were likely not to be down, whatever, however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year, five,
six, seven cuts, we thought that was probably a little overcooked. And so we put on those pay-fixed swaps in part
related to that, but in part related to the multi-year objective to reduce the duration on the securities book given
how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint. And so both of those objectives came into play when we
shortened the duration of the securities book, which right now is about 3.8 years. We're likely to continue to
shorten the duration book of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to 3 year or
thereabouts. And so that's really the driver there. But you've got to look at the overall balance sheet. And from an
overall balance sheet standpoint, it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the first
quarter. And at March 31, we remain an asset-sensitive balance sheet.
When it comes to adding downside protection in the out-years, we do note that we have a significant drop-off of
receive-fixed swaps when you get out into 2026 and 2027. And I think entry points matter. So, if rates continue to
stay elevated and we think there's value there, we want to be careful that we don't give up our upside that the C&I
loan book provides us. And we will do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it
in. And, in general, that would be consistent with something that would be north of 4% of the receive rate out into
2026 and 2027. And we'll be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to
protect the balance sheet over the medium-term.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Very helpful. And then this morning, one of your peers suggested that they're seeing corporate behavior
shifting from NIB to IB. Are you seeing some of your corporate clients take another look at optimizing their NIB
balances in the higher-for-longer rate environment recently?

Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think it's pretty much run its course at this point. We've had a little bit of a shift in the book but it's really slowed
down. I think the clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates. So, I'd say
our book and our mix is pretty stable right now and we expect it to stay here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say, overall, you saw our DDA stable at 21% at the end of 1Q, 21% at the end of 4Q. That's
important. That's the first time this has happened in a while. And so that stability we expect to continue as you get
throughout for the rest of the year and actually see growth as we mentioned earlier, based on our strategic
initiatives and the Private Bank contributing.
