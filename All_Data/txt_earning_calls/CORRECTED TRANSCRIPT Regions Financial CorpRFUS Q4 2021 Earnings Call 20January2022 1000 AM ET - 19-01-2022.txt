Thank you, Natalia. Welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level
commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings' documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer
and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section on our website. These disclosures

John M. Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with
our fourth quarter and full-year results. We achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating
environment. Earlier this morning, we reported full-year earnings of $2.4 billion and record pre-tax pre-provision
income of $2.7 billion.
Despite continued economic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control and our efforts are paying
off. We grew consumer checking accounts by 3% and small business accounts by 5%. Notably, our 2021 net
retail account growth exceeds the previous three years combined and represents an annual growth rate that is 3
times higher than pre-pandemic levels. We increased new corporate banking group loan production by
approximately 30% and generated record Capital Markets revenue.
Through our enhanced risk management framework, we delivered our lowest annual net charge-off ratio since
2006. We made investments in key talent and revenue-facing associates to support strategic growth initiatives.
We continue to grow and diversify revenue through our acquisitions of EnerBank, Sabal Capital Partners, and
Clearsight Advisors. We successfully executed our LIBOR transition program to ensure our clients were ready to
move to alternative reference rates. We continue to focus on making banking easier through investments in target
markets, technology and digital capabilities. We've surpassed our two-year $12 million commitment to advanced
programs and initiatives that promote racial equity and economic empowerment for communities of color.
Before closing, we're extremely proud of our achievements in 2021, but none of these would have been possible
without the hard work and dedication of our nearly 20,000 associates. The past year posed unique challenges as
we continue to transition to our new normal, both on a personal and professional level. Despite continued
uncertainty, our associates remain steadfast. They continue to bring their best to work every day, providing best-
in-class customer service, successfully executing our strategic plan and maintaining strong risk management
practices, all of which contributed to our success.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
In 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to focus on growing our business by making investments in areas that allow us
to make banking easier for our customers, all while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need
to be successful. We will make incremental adjustments to our business by leaning into our strengths and
investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time.
As announced earlier this week, a key priority in 2022 will be additional comprehensive changes to our NSF and
overdraft policies which are detailed in the appendix of our presentation. These changes represent a natural
expansion of our commitment to making banking easier for our customers and complement the enhanced alerts,
time order posting process, as well as our Bank On certified checking product we launched late last year. It's
important to note that the financial impact of these enhancements have been fully incorporated in our total
revenue expectation for 2022.
Again, we're pleased with our results and have great momentum as we head into 2022. Now, David will provide
you with some select highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Including the impact of acquired loans from the EnerBank
transaction, adjusted average and ending loans grew 6% and 7%, respectively, during the quarter. Although
business loans continue to be impacted by excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. And
encouragingly, we experienced a 240-basis-point increase in line utilization rates during the fourth quarter. In
addition, production remained strong with line of credit commitments increasing $4.7 billion year-over-year.
Consumer loans reflected the addition of $3 billion of acquired EnerBank loans, as well as another strong quarter
of mortgage production, accompanied by modest growth in credit card. Looking forward, we expect full-year 2022
reported average loan balances to grow 4% to 5% compared to 2021.
Let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continue to increase this quarter
to new record levels. The increase includes the impact of EnerBank deposits acquired during the fourth quarter,
as well as continued growth in new accounts and account balances. We're continuing to analyze our deposit base
and pandemic-related deposit inflow characteristics in order to predict future deposit behavior.
Based on this analysis, we currently believe approximately 35% or $12 billion to $14 billion of deposit increases
can be used to support longer-term asset growth through the rate cycle. Additional portions of the deposit
increases could persist on the balance sheet, but are likely to be more rate sensitive, especially later in the Fed
cycle.
While we expect the portion of surge deposits to be rate sensitive, you will recall that the granular nature and
generally rate insensitive construct of our overall deposit base represents significant upside for us when rates do
begin to increase.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased 6% versus the prior quarter, driven
primarily from our EnerBank acquisition, favorable PPP income and organic balance sheet growth. Net interest
income from PPP loans increased $8 million from the prior quarter, but will be less of a contributor going forward.
Approximately 89% of estimated PPP fees have been recognized.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Cash averaged $26 billion during the quarter; and when combined with PPP, reduced fourth quarter's reported
margin by 51 basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.34%, modestly higher versus the third quarter. Excluding
the impact of a large third quarter loan interest recovery, core net interest income was mostly stable as loan
growth offset impacts from the low interest rate environment. Similar to prior quarters, net interest income was
reduced by lower reinvestment yields on fixed rate loans and securities. These impacts are expected to be more
neutral to positive going forward.
The hedging program contributed meaningfully to net interest income in the fourth quarter. The cumulative value
created from our hedging program is approximately $1.5 billion, roughly 90% of that amount has either been
recognized or is locked in the future earnings from hedge terminations. Excluding PPP, net interest income is
expected to grow modestly in the first quarter, aided by strong fourth quarter ending loan growth, as well as
continued loan growth in the first quarter, partially offset by [indiscernible] (08:53).
Regions' balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates. Over the first 100 basis
points of rate tightening, each 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate is projected to add between $60
million and $80 million over a full 12-month period. This includes recent hedging changes and is supported by a
large proportion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash when compared
to the industry.
Importantly, we continue to shorten the maturity profile of our hedges in the fourth quarter. Hedging changes to-
date support increasing net interest income exposure to rising rates, positioning us well for higher rates in 2022
and beyond.
In summary, net interest income is poised for growth in 2022 from balance sheet growth and the higher yield
curve in an expanding economy.
Now, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 5% from the prior
quarter, primarily due to elevated other non-interest income in the third quarter but did not repeat in the fourth
quarter. Organic growth and the integration of Sabal Capital Partners and Clearsight Advisors will drive growth in
Capital Markets revenue in 2022.
Going forward, we expect Capital Markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110 million, excluding
the impact of CVA and DVA. Mortgage income remained relatively stable during the quarter; and while we don't
anticipate replicating this year's performance in 2022, mortgage is expected to remain a key contributor to fee
revenue, particularly as the purchase market in our footprint remains very strong.
Wealth management income increased 5% driven by stronger sales and market value impacts, and is expected to
grow incrementally in 2022. Seasonality drove an increase in service charges compared to the prior quarter.
Looking ahead, as announced yesterday, we are making changes to our NSF and overdraft practices which along
with previously implemented changes will further reduce these fees.
NSF and overdraft fees make up approximately 50% of our service charge line item. These changes will be
implemented throughout 2022; but once fully rolled out, together with our previous changes implemented last
year, we expect the annual impact to result in 20% to 30% lower service charges revenue versus 2019. Based on
our expectations around the implementation timeline, we estimate $50 million to $70 million will be reflected in
2022 results.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
NSF and overdraft revenue has declined substantially over the last decade. And once fully implemented, we
expect the annual contribution from these fees will be approximately 50% lower than 2011 levels. Since 2011,
NSF and overdraft revenue has decreased approximately $175 million, and debit interchange legislation reduced
card and ATM fees another $180 million. We have successfully offset these declines through expanded and
diversified fee-based services. And as a result, total non-interest income increased approximately $400 million
over this same time period.
Through our ongoing investment in capabilities and services, we will continue to grow and diversify revenue to
overcome the impact of these new policy changes. We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 3.5% to 4.5%
compared to the prior-year, driven primarily by growth in net interest income. This growth includes the impact of
lower PPP-related revenue and the anticipated impact of NSF and overdraft changes.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense has increased 5% in the quarter. Salaries
and benefits increased 4%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation. Base salaries also increased as we
added approximately 660 new associates, primarily as a result of acquisitions that closed this quarter. The
increased head count also reflects key hires to support strategic initiatives within other revenue-producing
businesses.
We have experienced some inflationary pressures already and expect certain of those to persist in 2022. If you
exclude variable-based and incentive compensation associated with better-than-expected fee income and credit
performance, as well as expenses related to our fourth quarter acquisitions, our 2021 adjusted core expenses
remained relatively stable compared to the prior year.
We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology, products and people to grow our
business. As a result, our core expense base will grow. We expect 2022 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up
3% to 4% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes the full-year impact of recent acquisitions, as well as
anticipated inflationary impacts. Despite these impacts, we remain committed to generating positive adjusted
operating leverage in 2022.
Overall credit performance remained strong. Annualized net charge-offs increased 6 basis points from the third
quarter's record low to 20 basis points, driven in part by the addition of EnerBank in the fourth quarter. Full-year
net charge-offs totaled 24 basis points, the lowest level on record since 2006. Non-performing loans continued to
improve during the quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels at just 51 basis points of total loans.
Our allowance for credit losses remained relatively stable at 1.79% of total loans, while the allowance as a
percentage of non-performing loans increased 66 percentage points to 349%.
We expect credit losses to slowly begin to normalize in the back half of 2022, and currently expect full-year net
charge offs to be in the 25-basis-point to 35-basis-point range. With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1
ratio decreased approximately 130 basis points to an estimated 9.5% this quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we closed on three acquisitions which combined absorbed approximately $1.3 billion of
capital. Additionally, we repurchased $300 million of common stock during the quarter. We expect to maintain our
common equity Tier 1 ratio near the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range.
So, wrapping up on the next slide are our 2022 expectations which we've already addressed. In closing, the
momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter positions us well for growth in 2022, as the economic recovery
continues. Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit risk is relatively

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions] Your
first question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, just going to – I actually didn't expect to ask this question, but the feedback that I got from
investors in terms of the performance today, obviously, your outlook is quite upbeat, is that the tangible book
dilution from the deals that you announced – rather closed in the fourth quarter surprised? And David, I'm
wondering if you could share with us sort of the earn-back period you expect for these deals on tangible book
value.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we look at several factors, not just tangible book value. We look at diversification of revenue. We look at
return on investment. Because when you – the alternative is buying your stock back, which also has a reduction in
tangible book value. So, you're trying to look at the trade-off between how you put your capital to work. And
frankly, I can't even remember what the payback was.
If we were looking at a bank acquisition, that's a little different, where we would expect a payback period of three
years or less. But in this case, we're looking at diversification and being able to grow and the return on that
investment is higher than the return we would have had if we would've bought our shares back.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
A couple questions. First, on the announcement that you made yesterday on the changes to the overdraft
insufficient funds fees. I know you sized it for 2022. Could you give us a sense as to – if that were to go in full year
full on, what that level would be because obviously as we think into 2003, we need to understand how you're
thinking about an annualized impact would be looking like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, the guidance we provided, Betsy, is if you go back to 2019, take the total service charge revenue, the
impact is going to be somewhere between 20% and 30% of total service charge revenue based on 2019 revenue
once all the changes are implemented and annualized.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
And that includes all of the things we already have done, too. So, it's a cumulative number. So, if you go back to
that, you can calculate – and round numbers will be half – we're going to have half to maybe slightly more than
that done in 2022. And so, it – in double at for close proximity of what the total would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And when you say the service charges from 2019, you're talking about the service charges from 2019 in your
income statement, not what shows up as regulatory like overdraft?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The, you're going back...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
...because, I mean, ultimately, all these fees are associated with the consumer business. And as we think about
how we overcome that loss of revenue, it is through growth in consumer checking accounts, additional activity,
debit card usage, debit card fees, other things that come with that. And as David has pointed out earlier, if you go
back to 2010-2011 timeframe and come forward, we've been able to significantly grow non-interest revenue while
overcoming the loss of revenue associated with Reg E and other changes. We expect the same will be true as we
look forward relative to the changes we're making here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
And Betsy, just to help you out a little. If you go into our public filings and our Supplement 2019, our service
charge number was $729 million, it's off that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Right. Okay. I was just going to confirm that. All right. Great. Thank you. And then, a follow-up question
here just on how you're thinking about the Sabal acquisition and how that's going to feed into not only the income
statement I heard you talk about, it's in the Capital Markets revenue line, but maybe help us understand, is there
any balance sheet impact here and the expectation that you have to grow this business from where it is today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I would say, the balance sheet impact will be modest. We'll have an opportunity to develop
relationships that might lead to our providing credit to customers and/or opening deposit relationships. We expect
that to be true for sure. The primary benefit we derived from Sabal is the capabilities we have – permanent
placement capabilities that we ultimately end up with. I think we're one of four or five banks in the country that will
have a complete array of real estate permanent placement products, whether it be a Fannie license, Freddie
licenses for large and small [ph] Dow or (23:17) CMBS capabilities.
We can bank our real estate customers' needs across the spectrum. And as we've transitioned from the Great
Recession to today, we built, I think, a really solid real estate business. Real estate permanent placement
revenue in 2021 will exceed $60 million. That's from zero in 2014 effectively. So, we've been building that
business around regional and national real estate developers, really strong balance sheets, good liquidity and
access to capital. The portfolio has performed very, very well. And we think this gives us an opportunity to extend
those relationships and drive additional profitability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And there's been some – pretty recently, some significant uptick in that demand for that product, right?

developers who like to build and hold want access to both the Fannie products and the Freddie products from
time to time. And we've again found that to be a great source of revenue and a wonderful way to build stronger,
deeper relationships with that customer segment.

Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the loan growth front, I want to see if you can maybe give us a little more color on the 4% to
5% growth expectation you have for the year. And maybe if you can unpack it by giving us a little bit of color on
the growth you expect for commercial and CRE and consumer, and how that could play out for the year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, it's David. So, first thing we have to overcome, it depends on if you're looking at it on the average
which is where are the 4% to 5%. First thing you have to do is overcome PPP average which is about $2.7 billion,
so put that in your model Then, if you look at areas where we can grow, clearly, we're going to get benefit of
EnerBank having a whole year of EnerBank along with its growth that we expect. And so, that's a big driver of our
averaging, mortgage ought to have a – may not have as much production as we have in 2021 for 2022, but we
still believe we'll grow the balance sheet quite nicely there.
We expect credit card to continue to grow. And then, on commercial, even after you consider overcoming the PPP
run-off on average at $2.7 billion, we think we can still grow that on top of it. As we look at the industries that we
were particularly strong in in 2021 in the commercial space, financial services, health care, transportation, our
asset-based lending, homebuilder, and to a lesser degree, technology, those are areas that we did see growth in,
quite nice growth and expect to continue into 2022. And it's been geographically diverse as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, separately, on the operating leverage expectation, based upon your
guidance, you're looking for about 50 basis points [indiscernible] (26:58) operating leverage. Can you just talk to
us about how – if Fed hikes may be proved to be less than expected, is that 50 basis points operating leverage
still attainable? Do you still have levers to pull to be – to basically generate that despite any move by the Fed?

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, it certainly makes it harder. But as we've always said, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage
over time. And if our revenue grows in there, then we double down on expense management, and we obviously
didn't get there this year nor did anybody else that I'm aware of. But we believe there's a reasonable path to that.
And that's why we gave you the guidance. It showed you that roughly 50 basis points or more. And we have
things we can do during the year that can help us get there. But yeah, rates not coming in at the pace we think or
as many as we think will put pressure on that calculation. But we wouldn't give up on it just because of that.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Just following up on the commentary around the positive operating leverage, I was
hoping you could frame a little bit more the – how much variability there is around that 3% to 4% increase that you
have in your outlook for expenses as those rate hikes begin to flow through. The forward curve reflects four hikes
next year, but some are expecting more than that. So, how does the number of hikes, I guess, to the extent that
we get more – influence the expense line. And does that 3% or 4% outlook hold? And on top of that, it would be
great if you could also discuss your confidence level and being able to control the expense base such that you
continue – you still achieve that positive operating leverage even under different inflation scenarios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, you have a lot up there. So, let me see if I can help you out. So, on the expense side, the 3% to 4%, a large
portion of that – a substantial portion of that was related to the acquisitions that we had. So, we closed on three
deals in the fourth quarter, one of them right at the end of the year. So, we'll have a full-year run rate on all of
those coming through. And that's the biggest single driver of the 3% to 4%. If you go back and look at our
compound annual growth rate on expense management, we've actually done a pretty good job of controlling our
expenses, and we don't do that in just one area, but at salaries and benefits and furniture, fixtures and equipment
and occupancy and vendor spend. All of those things, we are all over, and John has this – our continuous
improvement program is still going where we're looking to improve processes each and every day, leveraging
technology to help us control our expense load.
So, I think, in terms of the revenue side, we have four baked into our guidance that we just gave you, four 25
basis points of moves each quarter. So, on average, you get two during the year, and it depends on will we get 25
basis points or will be more than that. We'll be more than four or less than four. I mean, you have to – we've told
you in our guidance that each 25 basis points is $60 million to $80 million for us, so you can put your model and
kind of work with that.
But back to the question earlier, I think from John Pancari, in terms of operating leverage, we are committed to
generating positive operating leverage over time. And when things get more challenging, we'll do what we can to
manage expenses. So, I'll leave it at that.

done some things. We've given alerts. We've changed our posting order. We're going to give small dollar loans.
We're going to give you a paycheck up to two days available in some cases. And so, we're doing a lot of things to
make it easier for our customers to bank with us and to understand where they stand at any point in time. But if
they need that liquidity, we want to be there. We've limited our – we will be limiting our overdraft to no more than
three per day, too, which is one of the strongest in the industry. So, we're doing a lot of things. We think that's a
value play for our customers. So, they want that ability for that short-term liquidity at the cost that we charge for it.

Noted. And I guess just a separate question around loan growth. Apologies if I missed it. But talk to us about the
EnerBank acquisition, what that means for growth, especially some of the non-footprint? I think half of EnerBank
is outside of the core Region footprint. Give us a perspective in terms of the opportunity that you have there, both
in terms of what EnerBank does today and how to scale that up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we acquired about $3 billion worth of loans right at the end of the – at the beginning of the fourth
quarter. We'll get all that in our averaging numbers which is where our 4% to 5% growth is for next year. Their

production had been about 1% of the industry, which equated to about $1.7 billion in terms of production, and
that's what they were doing. And we think we have the ability to take that and ramp it up over time and have nice
growth there.
We're excited about EnerBank and excited about the fact that our geographic expansion of that is outside of our
core footprint. It brings us the ability to have more customers throughout the country, to do other banking services
with as well, including small business contractors that offer products to consumers. So, it is a big portion of our
growth expectation, and we couldn't be more excited about adding EnerBank and the people that work there to
the Regions family.

Hey. Good morning, guys. Another just follow-up on the expenses, David, can you help us understand of the 3%
to 4% growth, what part of that is just organic growth? What part is actually coming from the acquisitions, getting
into the run rate? And then, what are you doing in terms of like offsets in terms of continuous improvement type of
efficiencies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ken, as I mentioned earlier, the overwhelming majority of our growth is related to the acquisitions that we
have. We've been able and will continue to control our core expenses by managing the things I talked about,
managing salaries and benefits and head count and our square footage whether it be branch or office square
footage. When you manage your head count, you manage the number of computers you have to have. It's vendor
spend. It's our procurement group really ensuring that from a demand management standpoint that people that
are asking for vendors and third-party services really need them and when we have to have them, making sure
that we get the best price for the services that we're getting.
That's ongoing. That's part of our continuous improvement program. And you couple that with leveraging
technology and taking out processes that we have, we're not finished there. Now, we have to create opportunities
to reinvest. So, embedded in the 3% to 4% are the investments that we're making in people and our certain
markets that we have, that we see opportunities for growth there. We invest in technology, the people, and
services to help us there. So, all that's embedded in the numbers that we've given you. But cutting to the chase of
the 3% to 4%, the vast majority of that is related to the acquisitions that we announced.

Yeah, understand. And I apologize, I missed that comment earlier. I'm going to follow up separately, David, then
on the – just on that [indiscernible] (36:57). You terminated a little bit more this quarter. Just want to understand
like what percentage of that book is now kind of locked out from either you – that you've terminated or you
understand the maturity schedule and we see from your – that color, NII slide, what that expected trajectory is
like. So, I don't think there's much change. But can you let us know if there's anything different in terms of how
you're viewing that portfolio going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken, so we continue to kind of read the tea leaves and where the Fed is going and the market with regards
to rates. So, we took some of our protection off. It unwinds this summer, so we have a little bit more asset
sensitivity that comes in in the second half of the year. But we have to continue to monitor that because it's
important. It's important for us to make sure that we have the proper sensitivity when we expect rates to go, and
we do. And now, it's just timing. A month ago, maybe a rate increase or two. Other day, it's four. This morning,
there are people talking about maybe it will only be a couple. So, I mean, there's a – this is very volatile and we're
trying to do the best we can to anticipate where those rate moves are going. And we've locked in a good portion
of our fair value, if you will, of our hedge portfolio over half. So, I think that we're in good shape. We can terminate
some of those quickly if we want to put more sensitivity in. But right now, we think we're in a pretty good spot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And do you have an upper bounds of the sensitivity and how much you let it float off? And thanks for the answers,
David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
What we really want to do is we're not trying to top pick our margin in NII. What we're trying to do is have a
repeatable, predictable income statement. What we do when rates get to a point where there's risk of it going
down, we do have risk parameters in terms of how much risk we can have on NII with a 100-basis-point move.
But for us is really trying to anticipate where the market is going to move, so we can take full advantage there. But
we don't want to have an unusual pickup in any given period, whether be a quarter or a year. That's not
repeatable. That's not helpful to score our shareholders over time. So, we're trying to get back. We had given you
a range of getting up to our margin in the 3.70% range with a normal interest rate environment. We're probably
going to be in the higher 3.30s on a core basis this quarter coming up. So, we'll have a little bit of growth there,
but it's just making incremental moves on the portfolio as we see the interest rate environment change.

Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. David, can you elaborate further on slide 8 where you give us the interest rate exposure and you talked about
your deposit beta, particularly in the first 100 basis points of being 25% due to the higher betas on your surge
deposits. Can you tell us how large on the surge deposits on the [audio gap] (40:40) and can you give us some
color on how you define surge deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, our total surge deposits just mathematically are about $39 billion, okay? And so, when you think of
those surge deposits in terms of beta reaction, there's really two things that are happening with those surge
deposits. Of the surge deposits, about 65% of those, we think would have actually a lower beta – I'm sorry, a
higher beta. That's $25 billion, and we would put that beta at 75%, all right. I would think it's going to be pretty
high, pretty reactive. If you look at the other 35%, we think based on that nature of those accounts that those
deposits went into, that that beta is going to be similar to our legacy, the beta which is 10%. Then, if you take the
rest of our core legacy deposits, we put a 10% beta on that as well. And if you go back and look at the last 100-
basis-point rate increase that we had the last cycle, that's what the beta was. So, that's the math that we've really
gotten to in our guidance that we're giving you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And David, on the surge deposit and the exit non-operating deposits from your corporate customers or the
consumers that makes less money leftover from the stimulus?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. A big portion of those surge deposits are corporate deposits that came in because that's the best place
they could put their money. And that's why we believe that 65% of those deposits, call it, $25 billion at 65% of the
$39 billion. It's going to be very reactive because their corporate customers that are likely to put – want to put
those to work in a more meaningful place. And we don't need to pay up for that. So, we expect those to probably
either move out or to be more expensive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, as a follow-up, you highlighted your net charge-off ratio. I think you said, it's the lowest that
you've seen. And about this fee [indiscernible] (43:02) pointed to net charge-offs initially, probably staying around
the low levels you saw in the fourth quarter, gradually in the second half of the year start to head towards maybe
normalization. Is that based on just because the rates were so low that it's hard to maintain that? Or is it formulaic
or some underwriting that you have done that says now we're going to start – slowly start to see higher net
charge-offs later in the year excluding, of course, the acquisitions that may have influenced the reported
numbers?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's not an underwriting change. It's a reality that obviously consumers and businesses were propped up by
stimulus, consumers in particular. While that stimulus is running out in this quarter in terms of the child care tax
credit, we've been unusually low has it – as has the – in the industry. So, I think that our expectation is we would
start to normalize because of the run-off of the stimulus, which starts manifesting itself in the second half of the
year.
But that being said, we still think charge-offs will be rather lower than history at 25 basis points to 35 basis points
for 2022. We have – if the economy continues to perform and consumers do well and manage your money well,
maybe our charge-offs at the lower end of that range. So, a bit of it is trying to anticipate when normalization will
occur.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. It might be a little bit too early to think about this, but given rate expectations have increased so
much, when does that start factoring into how you're underwriting? Because obviously if rates go up to 3% or
even more, it does put pressure on borrowers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think, Matt, one of the things – so we're talking about four 25 basis points moves to get off of virtually zero.
If you think of a consumer, a lot of the consumer portfolios are fixed rate portfolios, so they don't end up having
much of an interest rate shock in four moves.
On the corporate banking side, again, four moves on them, we've been monitoring our customers. We know
which – where they stand. A lot of them hedge. We would expect that as rates starting – start to move, we
actually put on – our customers would put on more hedge protection, if you will. So, we – again, we don't see a lot
of payment shocks there. I think it's – the risk is running out of stimulus and also is there something unique in a
given business or industry that could drive losses higher versus rates at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
But the only other thing I'd say is on a normal course of business and when underwriting credits, we're always
stressing for interest rate sensitivity and – among other things that might occur. So, that would not be a change in
our common – current practice.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just separately and apologies if I missed it. Your Capital Markets revenue has been strong all
year, and you did increase kind of the run rate for 2022. But we've seen some of your peers have really strong
cap markets fees in 4Q. And I think part of it might just be a mix issue, but maybe you could talk to that, if you
didn't earlier. And if you did, I'll look at the transcript. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
No, no, no. I think it's a good question. If you just look at the bulk of our Capital Markets revenue distributed
across both capital raising and advisory services, so whether it's real estate, permanent placement, M&A, loan
syndications, or fixed income transactions, we are generating relatively similar amounts of revenue across those
platforms. So, we got good diversity. Now, we've added Clearsight Advisors and we've added Sabal Capital. And
so, when you consider the contribution that those acquisitions will make in concert with the businesses that – or
products capabilities that we've developed, we think the run rate of $90 million to $110 million per quarter is
appropriate.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. So, just one clarifying question, first, I wanted to make sure, David, from your
earlier commentary that the loan growth, the 4% to 5% does include the run-off of PPP or is it ex that PPP
impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
No, it includes that. It's – that was one of the important points that it includes overcoming that and having 4% to
5% growth on the average that you see for the year and it's in our supplement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Perfect. That's what I thought I heard. Thank you. That's great. And then, maybe the – one other question I had is,
can you talk a little bit about the hand-off kind of from the hedging income to the greater rate sensitivity that
obviously now you're pulling forward a bit. I know you have some detail there on slide 20, but I'm just kind of
wondering if you can walk through that. Is there the possibility that on a quarter-to-quarter basis we could see
some decline, is that $140 million run rate kind of pulls down and the impact of higher rates pulls it back up?

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, you can always have a little timing issue from a quarter-to-quarter. But we've got a number of things
going on in that chart that you can see, in particular our growth, loan growth in our EnerBank transaction that we
had. But a good portion of our hedge portfolio is locked in and we're adding the sensitivity of – I forgot who asked
the question earlier, but we had a little bit of sensitivity that help us in the second half of the year.
The key thing on the early moves, too, is that we're still very asset sensitive because of our deposit base. And so,
when you start seeing the first couple of moves, that bait is pretty close to zero. And so, I think that will aid in the
hand-off, but it might not be perfect. But if you're looking at making an investment in us over a period of time,
we've got to – we think we're well positioned to grow as the economy continues to grow. We get higher rates and
that's where Regions really shines because our deposit base that low core – low-cost core deposit base of ours is
better differentiator for us, as you haven't seen – we haven't been able to extract the value out of it because we've
been in such a low-rate environment. But now we're starting to see that opportunity if, in fact, we get the rate
increases that the forms have baked in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's very helpful. And just the one other point on that chart is the impact of organic growth obviously is
increasing in each subsequent year in 2023 and 2024. Is that to convey that you think organic growth can be even
better from a loan growth perspective or just that it will be more meaningful given it will be at higher rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, it's a little bit of both. I think we can continue to see absolute balance growth. We've acquired new portfolios,
and as I mentioned, so just one example is EnerBank, where we added $3 billion. The production there
historically had been about $1.7 billion. We're in a lot of states and we have a distribution that's far better in our
bank than what they would have had. And they were a regulated energy company, right? So, we have the ability
to take that to a new level. And so, that's just one example. That's why we continue to make investments because
we see opportunities to take a portfolio and be able to push that through our network and all the people that we
are working for us to continue to grow. You're also getting help by the rate environment. So, that's baked into that
4% to 6% compound annual growth rate as well.

Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. So, my question is about 2023 expenses. Last month, you said 2.5% was kind of a core run rate
for at least to think about wage increases. Is that kind of a good starting point to think about expenses for next
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Actually, Chris, we've had – we've seen some inflation this year. That number is going to be a little bit higher as
we think about merit increases, payments we need to make to retain certain folks, in particular people that are in
the technology side of the house, recruiting those type things. So, that 2.5% is a little bit higher than that now.
That is baked into the guidance we gave you. And so, I guess, bottom line is we have experienced inflation and
we expect that to persist into 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
No. Chris' question was around 2023. If I heard you correctly, Chris.

John M. Turner A

And that inflation, that's not transient. That's a going to be in the run rate for 2022. And then, you're going to
continue. Now, will you be able to revert back to merit increases that are more consistent in 2023 like we had in
the past, and I think that's accurate.

Okay. And then, one quick follow-up, please. So, last month, you said I think 2% was a good starting point to put
money to work I think given kind of a high level of dry powder, even with the surge deposits. Is that still your
thought process or do you think it's going to be a higher level now given with the 10 years already?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, we still think – so we think the short end as we told you, we probably have four short-term rate
increases going in this year, but we still think the 10-year kind of hangs out and approaches 2% by the end of the
year. So, we don't move as much.
We do think there's opportunities. There's a lot of volatility there if we see the ability to put $1.2 billion or more to
work in the securities book and were convicted on that, we'd be happy to. We have more cash – idle cash than
most everybody because we just have been reluctant to want to take the duration risk because we just don't think
we're appropriately compensated for it. That being said, things can change. And if we see closer to that 2% on the
10, that may persuade us to put a little bit more to work.
Now, remember, we're getting paid for all the increases on the short run – short rate for the money at the Fed, so
we're getting paid a little bit more there.

Hi, David. Hi, John. So, just a clarification on a couple of the last two questions. So, you said if the 10 year gets

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, no. We've given you in our revenue growth, but that's all baked into the budget. And so, you don't get
compensated at that level over par if you hit your budget. You've got to have a much better year than that, which
is what we and most of the industry players did this year. But you reset your expectations, now you're back down
at par. You got to start it all over again.

January? Has that continued to be strong because we obviously saw a bigger pickup later in fourth quarter and in
fact continuing in this first – couple of three weeks.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our pipeline is still good. Customers are optimistic. They are, I think, hopeful that we'll see trends continue.
They're prepared to make investments. Investments are still constrained in some measure by some uncertainty
and by shortage of labor in a lot of cases. But we do have – there are a lot of customers who are actually looking
at investments and want to expand their balance sheets, invest in businesses, and the same is true of consumers
who are spending. And so, we do expect just to continue to see loan growth.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Could you just talk about your interest now in more non-bank acquisitions, and where – if that's
still the case, where your interest lies, where the strongest interest lies in terms of revenue diversification?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we do continue to have an interest in non-bank acquisitions. We like to think continue to add to some of
the consumer lending capabilities we have acquired if those opportunities arise, invest in Capital Markets. I think
that got a nice return on those investments and been able to leverage those new capabilities to expand
relationships. We're interested in opportunities within wealth management. I'm always looking to acquire
mortgage servicing rights if those are available and to potentially add to our mortgage business. So, those would
be a couple of areas where we would make investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
