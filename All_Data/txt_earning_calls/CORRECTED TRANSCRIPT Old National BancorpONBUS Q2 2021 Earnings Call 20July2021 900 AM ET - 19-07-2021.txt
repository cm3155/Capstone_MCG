Thanks. Thank you and good morning. Starting on slide 5, we are pleased to share our second quarter results
and an update on our recently announced partnership with First Midwest Bank. I would characterize this quarter's
results as right on plan. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.41 when adjusted for specific merger charges; ONB
Way cost and debt securities gains. During the quarter, commercial loans, excluding PPP loans, grew nicely at
11%. Our net interest margin was stable. Capital markets and wealth management revenue were stronger and

mortgage revenue was down, but consistent with our expectations with a lower pipeline valuation and a smaller
gain on sale margin.
Expenses were well-managed and slightly higher, primarily due to merit increases and higher incentive accruals.
Credit quality metrics remained benign. Adjusted return on average tangible common equity was a strong 14.6%
and the adjusted efficiency ratio was just under 58%. During the quarter, we worked hard with our clients on the
SBA forgiveness process. 83% of Round 1 loans have been forgiven by the SBA and we've already have 18% of
Round 2 loans through the forgiveness process.
Most of our reported credit quality metrics approved during the quarter. We have reduced reserves consistent with
our modeling as a result of the better expected economic forecast and the massive stimulus programs. We still
have approximately 30% of our reserves supported by qualitative adjustments, given the higher-than-average
level economic uncertainty that exists today. The further we move beyond the pandemic's economic shock, the
more confidence we will have in taking our reserve closer to day one CECL. A quick update on hiring. We
continue to add significant talent during the quarter. The cost of the increased investment in talent will start
impacting our expenses slightly in the back half of the year. Our talent pipeline remains strong. We have a
fantastic story to tell and we have strong interest from new team members wanting to join.
Moving to slide 6, which contains a quick refresher on some of the more salient details of our merger with First
Midwest. I will not bother reading the slide, but I will share that I'm reminded each time that I'm with our First
Midwest colleagues, how much our cultures are aligned and how strong our strategic fit truly is. Additionally,
conversations with investors and sell-side analysts confirm they understand and agree with our strategic rationale.
Moving to slide 7. Both companies have a tremendous integration history and experience and our work is off to a
good start. We have made the appropriate SEC filings and regulatory applications. Kendra Vanzo and Jeff
Newcom have been appointed to lead the merger integration efforts, and we have assembled a group of over 350
team members from both companies to help with the integration. We have met with client facing and support team
members from both companies and they're all excited and engaged.
Additionally, the management team and outside advisor are deeply involved in making technology selections,
which we hope to finalize this summer. We also expect a special meeting of shareholders to be held in the third
quarter for each company. And lastly, despite the ongoing distraction from the pandemic and now our
transformational merger, we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities, and I think our
results illustrate the success of those efforts.
I will now turn the call over to Brendon.

Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 8. Our GAAP earnings per share is $0.38, while our adjusted earnings per share
is $0.41. Adjusted earnings exclude $6.5 million in early merger-related charges, $0.7 million in debt securities
gains, and the last of our ONB Way-related charges of $0.4 million.
Slide 9 shows the trend in commercial loans and the related commercial pipeline and production trends, all
excluding the impact of PPP loans. Q2 represents our fourth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth, and over
that year, commercial outstandings have grown more than $1 billion. Q2 commercial production of $1.1 billion
was the second highest on record, resulting in a $250 million increase in outstandings over prior quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Commercial activity continues to be strong throughout the footprint and we are heading into Q3 with a very
healthy $2.6 billion pipeline.
Turning briefly to pricing. Absolute coupons and new business continues to be impacted by the low rate
environment and the high percentage of floating rate versus fixed rate production. However, spreads and risk-
adjusted returns are strong and have remained consistent throughout this rate cycle. The investment portfolio
increased slightly in the quarter, as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth. We are taking a
disciplined approach of putting excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio, with new money yields of
1.53% and a portfolio duration well within five years.
Moving to slide 10. Average deposits increased 11%, while the growth and period-end balances have moderated.
Total cost of deposits for the quarter was a low 6 basis points, a 1-basis-point improvement over Q1.
Next on slide 11, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased $1.8
million quarter-over-quarter, largely due to our strong commercial loan growth. Excluding the impact of PPP, net
interest income increased $2.4 million, which was slightly better than expectations, as the impact of earning asset
growth more than offset the decline in asset yields. Net interest margin climbed 3 basis points to 2.91% from prior
quarter, primarily due to the low rate environment impact on asset yields. Core margin, excluding accretion and
PPP, declined just 2 basis points to 2.72%.
Slide 12 shows trends in adjusted non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income was $51 million in Q2, $4
million lower than the $55 million we recorded in the first quarter. The decline was primarily driven by lower
mortgage banking revenue that was partially offset by quarter-over-quarter improvements in all of our other major
fee categories. Decline in mortgage revenues reflects the macro headwinds impacting the industry today. While
mortgage production was largely flat from Q1, a decline in both the size and value of the secondary pipeline
resulted in a $5.6 million decrease in revenue. I would also remind you that Q1 was positively impacted by a $1.2
million recapture of prior year's MSR impairment charge.
Next, slide 13 shows the trend in adjusted non-interest expenses. Adjusting for merger charges, only related
charges and tax credit amortization, non-interest expense was $121 million. These results were consistent with
our expectations and our Q1 guidance.
Turning to PPP loans on slide 14. You will see a roll-forward of those balances, which stood at $721 million at
quarter end. We continue to assist PPP clients for forgiveness with approximately 83% of Round 1 and 18% of
Round 2 loans formally through the SBA forgiveness process. Unamortized fees on the remaining PPP loans
totaled $26 million. We continue to believe that most of the remaining loans will be forgiven and the related fee
income recognized in the second half 2021.
With that, I will turn it over to Daryl to discuss credit.

Daryl D. Moore
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Brendon. As we've presented in the past, this quarter's slide 15 reflects the performance of our loan
portfolio, both on a current quarter and historical trend basis. Total 30-day delinquencies continue their improving
trend for the fourth consecutive quarter falling to 9 basis points at the most recent quarter's end. As our
commercial delinquencies have historically been on the low side, the improvement we have seen over the past
several quarters has been concentrated in the retail portfolio with lower-than-historic delinquency rates in the one-
to four-family residential mortgage, indirect auto, and HELOC portfolios.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Government payments and higher levels of savings due to reduced spending during the pandemic have almost
certainly been a contributing factor to the lower retail delinquency numbers. While the effect of these payments
will diminish over time, many of our borrowers will benefit from the Child Tax Credit payments which began last
week and will continue at minimum at least through the end of the year. With all that being said, these extremely
low levels of delinquencies are, in my opinion, unsustainable in the long run.
Net charge-offs continued, well-contained with the $300,000 of recovery posted in the quarter. While total
recoveries were slightly lower than last quarter and at the lowest level posted over last six quarters, gross charge-
offs were less than $1 million which led to the net recovery for the period. Non-performing loans fell for the second
consecutive quarter, mainly on the reduction of non-accrual loans in the period. As you can see, the gap between
Old National and peers in this particular metric has favorably narrowed over the last several quarters. We
continue to perform well in net charge-offs and non-performing measurement category with net charge-offs as a
percent of non-performing loans being well south of 5% over the last six years. This, as you can see, is
significantly lower than peer levels over the time period.
As a closing comment, I would say that the challenges our borrowers are currently facing are much different than
what we might have imagined 15 months ago. On the C&I side, the most significant challenges many of our
clients seem to be facing are supply shortages and the lack of dependable adequately trained labor. Additionally,
we may see impacts on margins going forward with borrowers who are unwilling or unable at the present time to
pass along higher input costs to customers. On the commercial real estate portfolio front, we think all banks
continue to watch to see what long-term impacts the pandemic might have on the retail and office portfolio
segments.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Brendon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Daryl. On slide 16, you will see the details of our second quarter allowance which stands at a $109
million, a decline of $4.6 million from Q1, the improving economic outlook and the positive trends in credit quality
supporting modestly lower reserve levels. That said, we recognize that not all sectors of our economy have
recovered and the threat of future COVID-related disruption persists. As a result, we believe it is prudent to make
any larger-than-normal qualitative reserve until we have greater clarity on the economic outlook. I would also like
to remind you that we continue to carry $41 million in unamortized mark from our acquired portfolios. While these
marks will not directly off net charge-offs, any remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution.
As I wrap-up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We are very pleased with the fundamental results of
the quarter. Double-digit commercial loan growth led to higher core net interest income, despite interest rate
headwinds. Mortgage revenues were down due to pipeline valuation and normalizing margins, while all our other
fee businesses posted quarter-over-quarter improvements. Expenses remain well-controlled and our strong credit
quality continues to keep credit cost low.
Slide 17 includes thoughts and our outlook for 2021. We ended the quarter with a healthy $2.6 billion commercial
pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth. This historically low interest rate environment will
continue to put pressure on net interest income which should be mitigated through continued earning asset
growth. The PPP loan forgiveness process continued for our Round 1 and Round 2 clients and we expect runoff
of Round 2 balances to occur in the latter half of 2021 and the recognition of most of the related $26 million in
unamortized fees to occur at that time.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well. We're encouraged by the momentum in our wealth
business and the strong commercial activity should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital
markets business. While mortgage revenue will continue to follow industry trends, current production levels and
gain on sale margins should support quarterly revenue consistent with Q2 throughout the remainder of the year.
Our other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term. Our outlook on expenses is consistent with our
prior guidance. We expect a modest increase in the back half of the year as our efforts to attract top revenue
talent picks up momentum.
Lastly, a brief update on taxes. We continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we
work through the last of the remaining one-year historical tax credit commitments. In total, we're expecting
approximately $5 million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of
approximately 21%.
With that, we're happy to answer any questions that you may have. And we do have a full team here, including
Jim Sandgren and John Moran.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Gerlinger with Hovde Group. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Ben, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yes. Good morning, guys. Good morning. I was going to start off with just loan growth in general. You guys seem
to have pretty consistently beat both Midwest and National peer growth trends over the past, let's call it, four
quarters or so. I know you guys have done a great job getting out in the markets. I was wondering if you could
shed a little light on to kind of the secret sauce, if you will, of what Old National is doing to not only exceed peers,
but also have pretty sustainable growth really for the past four quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Ben. This is Jim Sandgren. I don't know if there's any secret sauce. Obviously, we're a strong relationship
bank. We've been out calling on customers really for the last 12 months, while many other banks obviously were
working from home. And so, that provided us an opportunity to serve our clients. We brought in a lot of new
prospects. I think we were pretty opportunistic as other banks might have changed kind of their credit stances.
So, I just think it's kind of blocking and tackling, being out helping our customers when they need us. And so, that
mentality is carried throughout the year and has certainly helped us as we've started the first half of this year.
Obviously, pipelines look good for the back half of the year. And so, again, I think I don't know if there's any secret
sauce. I think the fact that we restructured through the ONB Way and aligned skillsets of our relationship
managers with the client needs, I think that's played a major role as well. But, I just think it's the fact that we are
6

out and building strong relationships and being there for our clients and being opportunistic for those new
relationships as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Ben, I would just add, it's all hands on deck. I'm going to spend the next two days in Northern Indiana, I'll call on
clients. So, it's all hands on deck. We're all locked arms and we continue to believe we're doing – building quality
relationships for the long-term health and success of our company, and it's a primary focus of our entire
leadership team.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Great. That was a bit of a softball question. So the harder one would be, your new production yields are a
little lower than your net interest margin today. And then, even though you have a great deposit base and its very
low cost, I was wondering how you weigh continued growth against the net interest margin? Every loan you put
on should be a little dilutive today [indiscernible] (16:27) floating. So, I was wondering how you manage balance
sheet growth relative to maintaining that NIM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Ben, this is Brendon. Yeah. We've looked very closely at the pricing. We have very strict risk-adjusted
return hurdles for all of our loans. And as I said in my comments earlier, our spreads have held in throughout this
rate cycle. They've been strong. So, you think about that floating rate production today relative to LIBOR, that's
200 plus basis points over the LIBOR for that floating rate production. I think – so, we'll continue to put on loans at
that rate and feel really good about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q

Okay. Great. I will step back and get in the queue.

I'm Sorry, Scott.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
No worries. No, I'll get up earlier next time. Honestly, there are so many – I'm just thankful that I dialed the right
phone number. Let's see, but thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to sort of follow-up on the environment
for commercial lending. I feel like, last year, you guys capitalized so well some of your larger competitors, in
particular kind of shutting down for the year. To what degree have you noticed that there – especially the larger
guys, are they sort of back in the market in a bigger way, number one?
And then, number two, how, if at all, is that impacting the competitive dynamic as you see it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. Scott, this is Jim Sandgren. There's no question that really everyone's back in the market now. So
competitive pressures are certainly heating up. Again, we're staying very disciplined as we think about credit
structure, but we're still getting a lot of it back. Our pipeline, I think, remains robust as we pointed out. So still
feeling good about the back half. And there'll be deals that we're going to walk away from because there's
certainly some structures out there that are getting stretched and that's okay. But, overall, I think clients feel really
good about their opportunities to be successful in the back half of the year and into 2022. So, it's always going to
be competitive out there and I think we like our chances given our relationship banking model, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, I guess, just a question on the merger. So, President Biden had put out that
executive order a couple of weeks ago. Have you guys seen any impact in discussions with regulators on the
approval process? I mean, the order has kind of left a lot to the imagination. So, just I'm curious how the
conversations are going and if there's any change vis-à-vis what you might have thought prior to seeing the
order?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
No changes. No additional feedback from any of our regulators. Obviously, we're curious. We're not sure if it
applies to us or maybe our biggest brethren out there. So, time will only tell as we go through the regulatory
approval process. But really, no indications of any different. Just full steam ahead.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the bond portfolio given the back down – the move down in rates lately. You are obviously
not growing it too dramatically, but interested if you're a bit more cautious about growing at near term and maybe
what reinvestment rates are today versus the [ph] $153 million (20:17) that you gave in the quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, we'll continue to grow that investment fully to the extent we have excess liquidity that we [ph] can't
(20:25) put to work in the loan portfolio. New business rates are probably down a little bit marginally from the
average for the quarter, but not dramatically so at this point. So, we'll continue to be disciplined. And our hope is
that we continue to grow loans at the pace that we're growing. And as we talked about, the end of year deposits
have sort of moderated. That growth has moderated a bit. So hope is that we can continue to drive a better
earning asset mix to the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And on the loan growth, historically, the origination has been has been quite granular. I'm interested if any

No. It's still pretty granular, Chris. I mean, average loan new production still continues to grow over time, and I
think we're still just a little bit over, I think, $1 million. So again, that's grown over the last few quarters, but still
fairly granular.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one last one for Daryl, I mean, looking at your slide on the reserve, I'm trying to – I think
we're all trying to figure out where reserves bottom with the improvement, appreciating that you think around 30%
of your reserve is still qualitative? Do we get to – do we breach CECL Day 1 this year, if the economy continues to
improve at the pace it is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Hey, Chris. This is Brendon. I'll take that one. Look, what I'll tell you is, is this credit portfolio is actually a better
quality than it was pre-pandemic at Day 1 CECL. That said, we are going to be very, very judicious in bringing that
reserve down until we get some clarity around the economic outlook. But, as we look forward, it's a possibility and
we'll measure our portfolio on a CECL reserve based on the model when the time comes.

$1 million to $2 million approximately.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Brendon, a question for you or maybe, Jim on the deposit growth slowing a bit. It's a little bit different than
peers. Kind of like your loan growth is a little bit different than peers, but why do you think that is for you and does
that potentially make you a little more optimistic on the ability to hold the NIM later in the year if this continues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We'll see. I think the excess liquidity has been sort of certainly outside [indiscernible] (25:45) largely driven
by stimulus. So, I know, Jim and the team are still after their gathering deposits. It's still a focus of ours. But, I
think the stimulus generates excess liquidity [ph] seems to be not (25:56) moderating at least in our footprint and
our portfolio today. And as I talked about earlier, I do think it'll be helpful to margin, as we are able to put that back
to work in the loan portfolio, rather than the investment portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And is it too simple to say that maybe some of your commercial clients are using some of their deposits
and you're seeing some of this maybe pull-through in terms of loan growth or is it just the stimulus slowdown?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. And like I said, so core deposits still did grow quarter-over-quarter, just not at the rapid pace that they grew
before. And actually, our business deposits actually grew more than our retail deposits this last quarter. PPP
funds are starting to get drawn down a bit, but we're still holding a lot of PPP money still on deposit today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, Daryl, one for you. You touched on commercial real estate, retail and office. Just any changes in
terms of you're thinking there, any new concerns or any information you can share?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
No, Jon, I don't think there are. I think that has to play out as leases expire, right? So, you've got people in the
office buildings today and in the retail structures that are still paying lease payments. The real decision making
comes when those leases expire and what they do. Do they vacate those buildings? Do they renegotiate much
lower rates? So, we're all concerned about watching it, but I think we've still got probably 12, 24 months before
that all kind of plays out and we see the trends.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. First question is related to credit, and maybe this is more for Daryl. But, as you were
going through the process, the due diligence process with First Midwest, I'm sure you got a look at a lot of their
loan book. Are you having constant discussions with them pre-closing about the loan makeup and how they're
thinking about their ratings, or is that something that won't really happen until after the deal closes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. David, Daryl. We're not having extensive conversations only because as the two banks put their books
together, there is very, very little difference in the way we approach loans and the way we look at risk. And so, the
transition with the two banks is going to be probably as easy as any merger we've done or partnership we've done
up to this point in time. So, we're getting policies together. We're looking at those. We're tweaking those. We're
communicating a lot. But, there's not a lot of kind of arm wrestling about you're doing this right, you're doing this
wrong. It's just pretty much the same.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you, Daryl. Appreciate that. And then, as far as IT spending goes, in the near term prior to the close
of the deal, do you guys adjust how you're spending or how you're thinking about spending, and then any
changes in your longer term spending strategies once the deal does close?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. David, this is Brendon. No, I think as we talked about in the call, I think both banks have really robust IT
roadmaps. We're going to continue to complete those roadmaps and make incremental investment where it

makes sense as the time goes, but no material change in the run rate of our IT spend has been contemplated.
But, we think we have plenty of room to invest in some technology investments that will be meaningful to the
combined organization going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. David, I would just add that the war for talent will continue on our side. We're going to continue to ramp up
talent at all of our markets and especially doubling down in Chicago and Milwaukee and places like that. So, I'll
just add that we're going to continue to invest. I'm convinced that the key to our success and our story resonates
really well right now, and we're going to take advantage of that and make sure we invest in a lot of great talent.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
