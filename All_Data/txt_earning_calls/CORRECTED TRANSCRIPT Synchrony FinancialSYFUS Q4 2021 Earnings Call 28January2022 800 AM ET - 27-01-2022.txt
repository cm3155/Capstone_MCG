President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. We're really proud of our Synchrony team and the strong level of
execution that enabled us to close the year out with such strong results, including several company records.
Our core strategy to drive sustainable growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns is founded on three primary
objectives: first, grow our existing partner programs and win new partners; second, diversify our programs,
products and markets; and, third, deliver best-in-class customer experiences.
During 2021, we added 36 partners and renewed another 38. We're excited about the prospects in both our
existing portfolio and new partner pipeline to power innovative financing experiences and serve the ever-changing
needs of our customers. As you know, we're constantly seeking opportunities to extend our leadership position
and much of that will continue to be driven by the ongoing diversification and expansion of our distribution
channels.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
To that end, we acquired Allegro Credit at the beginning of the year, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer
financing audiology products. This acquisition allowed us to deepen our foothold in the Health & Wellness space,
reaching more providers and customers and empowering them with an expanded suite of financing products and
services.
We also announced our strategic partnership with Clover, which will enable us to deliver our innovative products
and experiences to more merchants and customers. As a reminder, our integration with Clover will enable small
businesses to access Synchrony financing products and services and accept private label credit card payments
via the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform.
In addition, Synchrony continued to expand our two main consumer-facing marketplaces, MySynchrony.com and
CareCredit.com during the year. These marketplaces are broad and deep networks that provide consumers with a
one-stop shop to find a shop with merchant partners and providers as well as submit applications and service
their accounts. And through the broad reach, easy accessibility and strong utility of these networks, Synchrony is
driving strong repeat sales.
Combined annual visits across these networks surpassed 300 million by yearend and we drove about 1 million
referrals and received almost 19 million provider views through CareCredit.com. Repeat sales across our
networks were 52% in the fourth quarter of 2021. An additional metric that we are focused on driving is sales per
active account, which are about twice as high in our CareCredit and Home & Auto networks compared to the
average Buy Now Pay Later products that we see in the marketplace. This is a testament to the deep customer
relationships that our network products foster.
Synchrony's ability to leverage our networks and drive new customers and repeat sales to our partners at higher
spend levels has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator, an important growth driver
for our business.
Another element of our continued diversification and expansion over the last year includes our health system
initiative, through which we successfully signed 7 new systems, bringing our total to 20. By integrating with health
systems through technology platforms like Epic, Synchrony is able to meaningfully extend our customer and
provider reach while also enhancing the utility of our CareCredit card.
For example, the Epic MyChart user base spans about 150 million patients. And by making our Patient Financing
App available within the Epic App Orchard, we're able to provide those patients with expanded access to
financing options wherever the provider or health system is part of the CareCredit network across a broad range
of needs from elective care to routine medical expenses and non-elective care needs.
In an environment where insurance coverage is increasingly limited, but health and wellness needs are rising, we
are empowering more patients and providers with greater choice, flexibility and utility as we expand our networks
and integrate with more health systems.
So, overall, 2021 was a year in which we accelerated our business strategy. Through strategic partnerships like
Clover, we can expand our reach by tens of thousands of new merchants. Through the expansion of our digital
networks, we can reach hundreds of millions of consumers. And collectively, the health systems with which we
have launched CareCredit in some capacity have over 40 million patient visits.
No matter how you look at it, Synchrony is at the center of a large cross-section of commerce in the US,
regardless of whether the purchase takes place in person or digitally. We connect almost 70 million average

active accounts through seamless omni-channel experiences to nearly 450,000 locations and we power their
everyday purchases from furniture and home improvement to healthcare products and services, car care needs
and clothing, jewelry and powersports with customized financing options that optimize value and outcomes for
both our customers and partners.
The more consumers, merchants, providers and partners that Synchrony reaches, the more diverse the demand
for products, services and value propositions becomes. So, we continue to diversify both our products and
programs in 2021 with the launch of our industry-first program with Walgreens and the introduction of our SetPay
Pay in 4 product.
In addition, we continue to advance the growth of our Synchrony Mastercard, which represents an important
opportunity within our product strategy to drive highly scalable growth and above-average returns to our business
over the long term.
During the second half of the year, we broadened our Synchrony Mastercard acquisition efforts to include new
digital channels, expanding our reach and accelerating our speed to market. With the real-time activity and data
capture, along with our sophisticated dApply capabilities, which include advanced prefill and credit decisioning
insights, we streamlined the application process and optimized the customer experience.
As a result, active accounts grew 11% in the second half compared to the first half of the year. And thanks to the
compelling value propositions we offer, our sales per active account grew 18% on the same basis.
Of course, as we continue to expand our wallet share, Synchrony is able to reach and serve more customers and
provide them with more choices and greater value. And as we strive to provide easy and comprehensive access
to a broader set of financial products and services, we are excited to launch PayPal savings in the first quarter.
Through this expanded partnership with PayPal, we will broaden the distribution of our savings product to reach a
unique set of customers with key features and functionality, including instantaneous fund movement between
PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their
financial goals.
Existing PayPal customers will be able to quickly and easily open their PayPal savings account inside the new
PayPal Super App.
We're proud to partner in this transformative initiative and remain intensely focused on continuing to elevate the
customer experiences we power across all our partnerships. It should come as no surprise that Synchrony's
consistent investment in digital innovation has enabled each of our product and partner successes along our
evolution. We are continuously enhancing the ways in which we deliver simple and seamless customer
experiences because the outcomes are far stronger for all of our stakeholders.
For example, during the past year, we upgraded close to 11 million accounts across 14 partners to our new alerts
platform, which delivers customizable e-mail, text messages and push alerts with real-time and rich transaction
data and notifications.
We also rolled out some upgrades to our SyPI platform, including several new features like digital wallet
provisioning and enhancements to push notifications and e-bill. Collectively, the availability of these features
contributed to a 40% increase in unique visitors in 2021 and 56% growth in the number of payments we received
in SyPI.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
With the rollout of enhanced native acquisition capabilities via SyPI and our client mobile apps, we've grown new
accounts for that channel by 67% year-over-year. And more specifically, by enabling wallet provisioning for
cardholders to add their Synchrony account to their digital wallet, fourth quarter wallet provisions grew 32% year-
over-year and wallet sales volume increased 63%.
So, when you put it all together, the unique combination of our deep lending expertise, the industry's most
complete product set and our advanced digital capabilities has enabled Synchrony to evolve into a leading
financial ecosystem that delivers compelling outcomes for our partners and our customers. There is no other
industry provider that offers the full breadth and depth of digitally-powered financing products, services and value
propositions that Synchrony does today and this ability to connect our partners and customers through best-in-
class omni-channel experiences is deeply resonating and driving record results for Synchrony and our
stakeholders.
In this past year, we achieved almost 25 million new account originations and record purchase volume of $166
billion and a 19% increase in spend per active account. These milestones, combined with strong credit
performance and our continued discipline around risk-adjusted returns and expense management enabled
Synchrony to deliver record financial results for the full year, including $4.2 billion of net earnings or $7.34 per
diluted share, a 4.5% return on assets and a 39% return on tangible common equity.
As a result, we were able to return $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.9 billion of share
repurchases and $500 million of regular dividends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the fourth quarter performance, which reflected broad-based
momentum across our business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results,
reflecting our differentiated business model and the strong partner and customer value propositions, which have
been made possible as we execute on our strategic priorities.
Our net earnings were $813 million or $1.48 per diluted share. We generated a return on average assets of 3.4%
and a return on tangible common equity of 28.7%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power
and efficiency of our digitally-enabled model, combined with the compelling value of our financial products and
services we offer through our ecosystem.
Not only were we able to support the strong seasonal customer demand with our diverse range of products, but
we were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns. We achieved record
purchase volume of $47 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18% compared to both last year in 2019,
excluding Walmart.
Purchase volume was up double digits across four of our five platforms, demonstrating clear broad-based
strength through the range of diverse industry verticals we serve. Purchase volume per account also increased
during the quarter, up 13% compared to last year and 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding
Walmart.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the fourth quarter and increased 30%
from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, including the loans receivable held for sale, Dual and co-branded
cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 10% from the prior year.
Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 20%, totaling more
than 7 million new accounts in the fourth quarter and almost 25 million new accounts originated for the year.
As you may recall, we reached an agreement for the sale of our Gap portfolio, which represented $3.9 billion of
loan receivables in our held-for-sale portfolio at yearend. Continuing our commitment to achieving appropriate
risk-adjusted returns, we are discontinuing our partnership with BP, which resulted in the reclassification of
approximately $500 million of loan receivables to held for sale in December.
Excluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, loan receivables would have increased by 4% versus the prior
year as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate.
RSAs were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and 6.15% of average receivables. The $220 million year-over-year
increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program
performance, including receivables and purchase volume growth as well as the improvement in net interest
income.
Focusing on our credit performance, provision for credit losses was $561 million. Included in this quarter's
provision was a reserve build of $72 million, net of the reserve reductions from our held-for-sale portfolios of $98
million. Excluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, the $170 million reserve build reflected the impact of
loan receivable growth within the context of our unchanged set of macroeconomic assumptions and credit
normalization outlook, which includes peak loss in the first half of 2023.
Other income increased $85 million, driven by a $93 million gain in a venture investment. While we'll provide more
details later on in our discussion, I want to highlight that the majority of the fourth quarter EPS benefit from this
gain was offset by unrelated asset impairments and certain opportunistic marketing investments we executed in
the fourth quarter.
Moving to slide 8 and our platform results, our Home & Auto, Diversified & Value, Digital and Health & Wellness
platforms each continued to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong
diversified demand.
Our Lifestyle platform also experienced robust demand as purchase volume increased 6% year-over-year, but
faced a tough comparison to last year's strength in power sports volume. Loan receivable growth trends by
platform generally reflected the more modest growth versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was
partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates.
Average active accounts trends ranged on a platform basis up by as much as 9% in both Diversified & Value and
Digital. Home & Auto, Lifestyle and Health & Wellness average active accounts grew in the low-single digits were
relatively flat.
The average active account growth in Diversified & Value largely reflected the stronger retailer performance.
Digital active accounts were up versus the prior year due to the greater engagement across our existing customer
base and new programs. Interest and fee trends, while generally improved across the platforms, continued to be
impacted by elevated payment rate.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
I'll move to slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. The accumulated savings by consumers,
combined with seasonally higher holiday transactor behavior, impacted payment rate during the fourth quarter. As
we progress through the period, payment rate moderated somewhat from the third quarter levels, but increased
with the seasonal holiday spend we typically see in December.
Payment rate for the period was about 180 basis points higher than last year and 290 basis points higher than our
five-year historical average. When tracking the account payment trends from the third to the fourth quarters, we
see a slight mix shift away from above and full statement balance payments towards more minimum and below-
minimum payments.
More specifically, the percent of account balances paying their full saving balance decreased sequentially by
approximately 20 basis points and the percent of accounts paying between their minimum payment and their full
statement balance decreased sequentially by approximately 70 basis points. The percentage of accounts paying
their minimum payment or less than their minimum payment increased sequentially by approximately 90 basis
points.
We continue to expect payment rate to gradually normalize as customer spend remains robust, the consumer
savings rate is declining and industry-wide forbearance expires. While it is difficult to predict elevated consumer
spending, lower consumer savings, inflationary pressures and return to full financial obligations has begun to
impact accumulated savings levels by consumers which we believe will lead to a moderation in payment rate.
Fourth quarter interest and fees were up approximately 2%, reflecting average loan receivable growth. Net
interest income increased 5% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as
well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.77% compared to last year's margin
of 14.64%, a 113-basis-point improvement year-over-year, driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and
favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs.
More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 500 basis points
from 79.9% to 84.9%, driven by average receivables growth and lower liquidity held during the quarter. This
accounted for a 96-basis-point increase in our net interest margin.
Interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.18%, a year-over-year improvement of 51 basis points, primarily due to
lower benchmark rates. This provided a 42-basis-point increase in our net interest margin. The loan receivable
yield was 19.61%, a year-over-year reduction of 32 basis points. This resulted in a 26-basis-point reduction in our
net interest margin.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 10. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year
improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.62% compared to 3.07% last year
and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.17% compared to 1.40% last year.
When removing the impact of the held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the fourth quarters of
this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down approximately 60 basis points
versus 45 basis points and the 90-plus metric will be down approximately 30 basis points instead of 23 basis
points.
Our portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive strong year-over-year improvement we've seen
in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.37% compared to 3.16% last year, a 79-basis-point improvement. Our

allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.76%, down 52 basis points from 11.28% in
the third quarter.
Let's move to slide 11 to focus on expenses. Other expenses of $1.1 billion include the impact of $46 million of
asset impairments and $29 million of certain incremental marketing investments. Excluding these impacts, other
expenses increased 5% compared to the prior year.
Focusing on employee compensation, fourth quarter was impacted by two key factors: one, higher hourly wages
as we raised the minimum wage to $20 during the third quarter; and second, higher incentive compensation as
2020 levels were negatively impacted by the pandemic. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 41.1%
compared to 37.1% last year.
Excluding the impacts of the gain on our venture investment, the asset impairments and the incremental
marketing investments, the efficiency ratio will be 39.7%. Even with these adjustments, our efficiency ratio
remains elevated compared to our historical average due to lower revenue, which has resulted from the impact of
higher payment rate and lower average receivables.
We will continue to take a disciplined approach to expense management while also maintaining the pace of
strategic investments in the business. This continues to be a clear point of differentiation for Synchrony.
As we demonstrated through our Investor Day, Symphony leverages our legacy of operating smaller dollar
balances to acquire, originate and service our accounts more efficiently than other general purpose issuers. Our
cost to acquire is half that of private label peers and a quarter of the broader industry's average.
It's also important to remember that throughout the course of the pandemic, we have maintained a relatively
steady level of marketing spend to stay engaged with our customers, much of which is largely contemplated
within the RSA. As a result, Synchrony generally does not ramp up our marketing expenses in order to compete
for new customers.
Similarly, we consistently prioritize investment in our business and technological innovation. The digitally-enabled
products and services that we offer and the seamless omni-channel experience that we power for some of the
most sophisticated technology partners in the world would not be possible without our tireless focus and steady
investment in innovation year after year.
So, while the return of our operating efficiency ratio to approximately 32% will primarily be driven by the
normalization of payment rate and thus the recovery of revenue, we are confident in our ability to continue to
achieve market-leading operating leverage as loan growth continues.
Now, let's move to slide 12 and discuss another core strength of Synchrony's, our funding, capital and liquidity.
Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, coupled with the stickiness of our deposit base,
we have generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during the year. While we believe it's prudent to
maintain a higher liquidity level during periods of uncertainty, we've been actively managing our funding profile to
mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile.
As a result of this strategy, there was a slight shift in our funding mix compared to last year. Our deposits declined
by $512 million from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.3 billion. This
resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized funding comprising 10%
of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at quarter-end.

Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $15.7 billion, which equate to 16.4% of our total assets,
down from 24.7% last year.
Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the
transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits. First, it delayed the
effects of CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years. And, second, it allowed for a portion of the
current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.
With this framework, we ended the quarter with 15.6% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 30 basis points
lower than last year's level of 15.9%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.5% under the CECL transition rules
compared to 16.8% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 30 basis points to 17.8%. And the Tier 1 capital
plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.4% compared to 27% last year.
During the first quarter of 2022, we will recognize the first portion of the CECL transition adjustment which
reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 60 basis points. As a reminder, the impact of CECL has already been
recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our
regulatory capital metrics.
We continue to execute on our commitment of strong capital return to shareholders by returning $1.1 billion to
shareholders in the fourth quarter through $982 million in share repurchases and $120 million in common stock
dividends. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and $500 million in
common stock dividends.
Given the strong performance of our business during the year, our board approved an increase in our share
repurchase authorization through June 2022 by an incremental $1 billion. As of December 31, we had $1.2 billion
remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We have begun our normal capital planning process and we'll
provide an update to our planned capital actions once approved.
Our business generates strong returns and considerable capital, reflecting our commitment to drive consistent
growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our continued cost
discipline. We have considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy either through growth or returns
to shareholders.
Accordingly, we will continue to take an aggressive but prudent approach to returning capital to our shareholders,
guided by our business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory
considerations.
Finally, let me focus on our outlook which is summarized on slide 13 of our presentation, assumes a stable to
improving macroeconomic environment and a well-controlled pandemic. For the upcoming year, we expect
consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the various
industries and markets we serve. As consumer savings begins to decline and payment rate moderates, we'd
expect purchase volume growth to moderate somewhat. We expect our net interest margin should reflect the
trends consistent with those during the second half of 2021 and should follow historical seasonality.
With the advance of our held-for-sale portfolios in late Q2, we anticipate some excess liquidity, creating a modest
headwind to NIM in both the second and third quarters. And as we've done in the past, we will work to reduce this
excess liquidity quickly.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
As payment rates moderate and credit trends normalize through the gradual rise of delinquency and loss, we
expect higher interest and fee yields to be offset by higher reversals. Our current expectation is that delinquency
will peak in the fourth quarter.
Given our reserve levels at yearend, we'd expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven and partially
offset by the approximate $130 million of final reserve reductions associated with our held-for-sale portfolios. RSA
expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, but should
begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise.
In terms of operating expense, we generally expect quarterly expense to run in line with the fourth quarter 2021
levels, excluding the impact of asset impairments and certain marketing items we discussed earlier.
And lastly, with regard to our held-for-sale portfolios, we anticipate conveyance to occur in the second quarter,
producing a non-recurring gain on sale of approximately $130 million. We expect to redeploy this gain through
completely offsetting incremental investment in our business, thus be EPS neutral for the full year.
So putting it all together, Synchrony's differentiated model is powering strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted
returns through changing market conditions and we're emerging from the pandemic with considerable momentum.
As we continue to leverage our core strengths, our diversified portfolio, which provides resiliency and sustainable
growth, our deep industry expertise, advanced data analytics and digitally-enabled product suite, the combination
of which enables strong risk-adjusted returns and our scalable technology platform, which powers efficient
customer acquisition and servicing as well as swift partner integrations.
Synchrony will continue to engage more customers, drive greater lifetime value and deliver sustainable growth at
peer-leading risk-adjusted returns. So, as operating conditions continue to normalize, we remain confident in our
ability to achieve the long-term operating metrics we laid out at Investor Day to continue to drive considerable
value for all of our stakeholders.
I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his concluding thoughts.

Thanks, Brian. I could not be more proud of the Synchrony team and all that we have achieved this year for our

This has positioned us as a leader in the digital commerce revolution with very exciting opportunities ahead of us.

Hi, Sanjay.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. How is it going? Question for both Brians on loan growth. I know payment rates are sort of weighing against
the underlying loan growth expectations. But your long-term targets are sort of high-single digits to low-double
digits. Some of your peers are at their average, if not above their average. Maybe you could talk about what's
driving sort of the weakness relative to your long-term expectations or do you expect in 2022 to get there?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sanjay, maybe I'll start and then ask Brian to comment. I would say, look, generally, we feel really good
about the operating environment right now. We feel really good about where the consumer is. Last year was a
record year in terms of purchase volume on our products. And if you look at that, one of the things that's really
encouraging is if you look at that by demographic, a lot of that is actually driven by Millennials and Gen Z.
Sales on our accounts with Millennials and Gen Z were up 42% compared to 2019. If you look at Baby Boomers,
that was up only 6%. So, as you think about that mix shift, our products are definitely, very attractive to that

younger demographic. We also generated 25 million new accounts for the full year. So, we actually feel really
good about the growth prospects.
And as you said, the thing that's a little bit difficult to call right now is the payment rate, but I think if we see
payment rates just normalize a bit, they don't need to go all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. If they just
normalize a little bit here in 2022, we could definitely see loan growth in the high-single digits for the full year.
I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The color I'd add, Sanjay, is that when you look across purchase volume across all our segments, we're
seeing strength in all the platforms. So, that diversification is pulling through. And I think when there's a
comparison to some of our peers, what gets lost here is the resiliency in our business, right? We do not have as
much volume decline as others or asset decline as others last year. So, we are being more consistent with that.
And listen, I definitely agree. As we entered into 2022, we came off a record purchase volume. I think as we think
about the first month of the quarter, we're seeing a strong mid-teens growth in purchase volume as that continues.
And we do see – and I'm sure we'll talk later in the call on payment rates, we are seeing some moderation.
So, I do think you can see that high-single digits. And in certain scenarios, we have one scenario that says you
can give me in double digits with regard to loan growth. So, we feel really good about the model and where we're
entering 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
The last thing I'll add, Sanjay, just if you look at that across the platforms, it's pretty broad-based. If you look at
purchase volume, Digital was up 22%, D&V up 26%. We got a ton of room to grow in Health & Wellness. Their
sales were up 14% in the fourth quarter.
So, again, pretty broad-based growth and it's nice to have turned the corner with all of our platforms having
positive receivable growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's wonderful. Maybe another revenue driver, you guys sort of talk about the NIM, Brian Wenzel. And I
know there's a lot of liquidity and all this other stuff that affects that metric. But as we think about the yield, I see
that last bullet says higher interest and fees offset by higher reversals. Is that one for one or do we expect the
yield to improve over the course of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The way I would think about it, Sanjay, is as you see the payment rate decline, you're going to see the yield
go up on the book, right? The reversals that come ultimately will be with the charge-offs, which will trail that and
it's not one for one. It never has been. The impact on the NIM this year, it is benefiting from reversals, but not
necessarily the key driver behind it. So, it trails and it won't be one for one.

Operator: From Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Brian Wenzel, I guess, you talked about the normalization of the efficiency ratio. And in this
environment, investors are paying a lot more attention to expenses and costs. And you said that you'd be driven
by the revenue that has been kind of deferred, lost, suppressed. Can you talk about how you think about how
large that is and over period of time that comes back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. A great question, Moshe. First of all, I want to start with the expenses. We're up – when you strip out the
impairment and discrete items that we elected to execute based upon some gains we had in the quarter, our
expenses are up 5% year-over-year. And if you think about that, just to start, a lot of it is employee-driven, right?
We increased our hourly wage to employees. We also had some onetime adjustments relative to some critical
roles in the organization, you think about data scientists, technology, et cetera.
So, the base in the run rate as we see going forward is pretty stable. And as I said in my prepared remarks, first of
all, we don't have to inject a lot of money into this in order to drive our growth. So, the expense base, as we step
through each of the quarters, will be relatively consistent.
As you think about the efficiency ratio, clearly, the revenue and the yield is lower than we anticipated. So, I think
over the course of that, call it, the revenue normalization between 2022 and 2023, you will see come back and we
see a pathway back to that 32%, 33%. But right now, we're managing hopefully tightly to the dollar amount as we
step through. Again, it's mainly volume oriented now with more active accounts and higher volume that go through
the associations or networks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
So, I guess just to be clear, your cost base is going to be closer to fixed as volume expands and maybe credit
normalization causes the RSA to actually benefit revenue over the course of the next several quarters. Is that
what we should be thinking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
I would say on a dollar basis, that would generally be true. I think what we're going to drive is there will be an
increase in the variable components of that, but we'll drive productivity to offset that and keep the expense base
relatively flat. So, I wouldn't say there's a [ph] ship (38:06) to be fixed. It's we're going to drive productivity and get
operating leverage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q

Good morning, Ryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Brian, maybe as a follow-up to Moshe's question, if I look at the expense guidance, I adjust for the $75 million, I
think it points to about 7% to 8% expense growth. So, I just wanted to clarify, for 2022, is the expectation that
you're going to generate positive operating leverage? Can you maybe put some parameters around how to think
about expenses relative to the revenue backdrop?
And then, more specifically, the slides talk about you reinvesting the $130 million from the gain, is that included in
the expense outlook? And should we then view that as a onetime step-up or will it remain in the run rate? And I
have a follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Ryan. Let me deal with the latter part of your question. The $130 million and
any potential offsets we have will not be in the run rate. They will be onetime. So, when we actually make those
decisions, and that could be a wide ranging effect, that could deal with some of our fixed costs and again,
continuing to adjust for the way in which we work. There could be some investments in marketing programs and
we'll highlight those, but it should not go into the run rate of the business and would be additive to what we have
here on the page.
I think generally, when you think about the expense base, we are going to generate positive operating leverage
and that's the way the model was set up. So that, as we think about the expenses this year, our view would be
that we would have greater growth relative to the assets and the revenue. So, we do believe we're going to get
operating leverage. We're going to manage the positive operating leverage throughout as we step through 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks. And if I can ask a follow-up question, on credit, loss is obviously at very, very low levels. And
we've seen a little bit of increases in delinquencies and charge-offs. So, I was wondering, can you maybe talk

about any noticeable trends you're seeing across the portfolio? Are you seeing any more normalization in the near
prime relative to the prime?
And then second, Brian, just to clarify, the allowance at 10.76% versus 10% day one CECL, although I recognize
that 4Q is seasonally low. You mentioned it being asset-driven. So, is day one CECL still the eventual
destination? And maybe can you just give us some color on how to think about the trajectory of the reserve over
time? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, let me – I'm probably going to give you a longer answer on credit, Ryan, because I do think it's
important to get this background. To specifically answer your question, we have not seen anything discernible in
our results and I'll explain to you where we come out. But there's nothing that we see that says this is performing
worse than our expectations.
I think we understand there's a lot of concern about what the term credit normalization means and how fast that
comes and the ranging damage. I want to give you a framework. First, we talked about, earlier in the call, in my
prepared remarks, about the delinquency being 60 basis points better and 30 basis points better than previous
periods when you exclude the held for sale. So, the delinquency formation of how that will give you lost content
for the first half of the year is in great shape.
I think, Ryan, when we look at the vintage performances, both on a cumulative basis and a coincident basis and
look at it from 2018 forward in these six-month kind of tranche views, each of the vintages from 2018 through
2020 have improved. And we see no deterioration in those vintages as we sit here at the end of 2021.
When you look at 2021, both 2020 and 2021 are significantly better than all of the pre-pandemic vintages,
significantly better. When we look at 2021 specifically, that's a little bit worse than 2020, because we took some
credit refinements. We don't believe we have added incremental risk in, but slightly worse performance, but,
again, significantly better than pre-pandemic.
I then think you have to think about three other factors, Ryan, as you think about credit. The first is our credit
strategy and multiproduct strategy. Our credit strategy is we have a tighter [ph] loan grow line (42:39) strategy.
We have tighter account management strategies, which gives us lower severity as you head into this
normalization period.
So, we think we'll be less volatile and that's been demonstrated when you go back and look at the loss curves
both in the GFC, recessions and then the pandemic. And then, I think when you look at the tools we outlined on
Investor Day, the increase in data analytics, the unique sources, the ability to be more surgical, we can control
credit as we step through 2022.
And then, the last thing is the RSA, right? The RSA will ultimately take those charge-offs and our partners will
offset that. You combine that with the revenue generation, this would give you a resilient risk-adjusted margin as
you kind of step through. So, that's how I think about credit. I think Brian and I and leadership team are really
comfortable with how credit will develop in 2022 into 2023.
With regard to your second question on the allowance, we don't have a differing view that says we're not going to
get back to day one CECL. It really goes back to what you think your target loss rate is and what your mean loss
rate is and we don't really have a fundamental view.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
There'll be some portfolio mix that comes into that, but I think we ultimately can migrate back to that, assuming
that's the view that we hold, it's really the timing. And that generally – if you hold that view, there could be offsets
to asset-driven provisioning as we step through 2022.
So, I apologize for the long answer, but I think a framework for how you think about and talk to your customers.

Operator: From Citi, we have Arren Cyganovich. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. On the NIM outlook there, I was wondering when you look at the guidance there on the kind of 2H
levels, which is, I guess, around 15.60%, I would have expected that to rise a bit more with the rate increases
we're seeing. How many rate increases do you expect for the year? And what are some of the other aspects that
are keeping that somewhat lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, with regard to expectations for rate increases, we have three rate increases is our current view.
Obviously, the market, I think, depending upon the day, may be different than that. But you got to remember, in
our portfolio, less than 50% of our receivables are variable rate and then when you factor in the transactors, it's
rough – I think less than 30%.
So, we're not going to be highly subject to, I'd say, NIM movements. There could be 20 basis points, 30 basis
points potentially as it relates to NIM. But to be honest with you, it's not a significant driver. And at the end of the
day, we intend to run our book really on a rate-neutral scenario. We're slightly asset-sensitive, but not a lot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then, it's helpful to have a discussion of expense base [ph] with a counter (45:44) revenue item,
the loyalty program cost kind of ticked up a decent amount in the fourth quarter, I guess, likely from, I guess, the
sales volume you had there. But what's the outlook on your loyalty program cost ahead?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Great question. Brian and I look at this, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It really means that our
customers are engaging with our products and driving volume. So, you're right, it is volume-driven, number one.
And you can see that in our dual card volume, our co-branded volume. Our new programs are contributing to
some of that rise. And then, the final thing is, obviously, value proposition changes where we refresh value props
to drive volume factor in there.
The other important element that sometimes gets lost is this is a program expense where approximately 80% of
this is shared back through the RSA. So, we don't bear the burden. And I think, again, going back to the unique
model, we don't have to inject a lot of marketing to drive growth. We don't have to inject a lot in the loyalty. And
then, our partners are sharing both in the marketing expenses and the loyalty. So, there's a natural buffer in the
RSA. So, again, a lot of it's offset in RSA and it's generally a good thing that it's rising, means our customers are
engaging with our products.

Operator: From Morgan Stanley, we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks so much. Couple of questions here. First on just expenses to tie that up a little bit. I know you've got
the longer-term guide on expense ratio out there from your Investor Day last year, 32%, 33%. Is that something
we should be expecting you would be targeting over the next year or two or is that more like a 2024, 2025 kind of
timeframe?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. First of all, good morning, Betsy. I would not consider that a 2022 related metric. We're in a transitory year
relative to the revenue. So, I think you begin to look at that when you move into 2023 and how the revenue really
develops. Again, we're going to control the expense dollars. We can control that. The actual output of that has a
denominator that's a little bit less controlled, given the elevation in payment rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, the other question just on expenses has to do with the investment spend you're making. You've
got the $130 million gain and then you're going to be investing that. And from the commentary, it sounds like
you're talking about making those investments like during the second, third and fourth quarter next year. Is that a
fair read of what you're telling us?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, I would look at the investment being primarily in the second and third quarter. That's where we'd like to
have it in there to get the leverage effect of it. Obviously, it will depend upon the types of actions. And again, I
think there will be a combination of actions that both had tried to reduce the fixed cost of the business as well as
incremental investments really to drive the growth side of the business. So, Brian and I will review that with the
team and set our plans out and hopefully be able to give you an update at our first quarter earnings call in April.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
It's fair to say, Betsy, we're not going to make any investments that don't have a really good payback, a really
good return use of those dollars.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Are you talking more about like marketing or investments in the programs as opposed to technology? Is that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
It's going to be a combination of things. It will be and potentially could be. We'll look at some of the fixed costs that
we have in the business relative to facilities. It could be refreshes of certain programs where we may reissue

cards and do things like that, campaigns like that. It could be in technology where we may try to accelerate and
continue the acceleration of our digital capability.
So, it's a combination, but Brian has hit on it. We're going to go through a review and the best projects with the
best payback and IRRs will ultimately win.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
It's usually two lists, Betsy, that we look at. One is to drive long-term efficiency in the business and the other one
is to drive growth, right? Both lists have great paybacks. We have a really disciplined process around how we
evaluate those investments and we'll obviously run that same play this year.

Operator: From Wells Fargo, we have Don Fandetti. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Seems like the CFPB has been talking a little bit more about cards recently. Can you provide
your updated thoughts on the regulatory environment? And secondarily, how is the pipeline for new partners and
portfolios?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Hey, Don. So, look, I'd say the regulatory environment has been fairly stable. Obviously, we saw the
CFPBs request for information regarding fees. First, I'd just say that we always strive to be very transparent in
terms of our disclosures with our consumers. We really don't have a lot of fees other than late fees. As you know,
those are already governed and calculated by the CFPB. We're completely compliant with that and their guidance
on late fees today. So, we'll obviously stay close to that, but nothing more to report really at this point.
And then, I would say, generally, the pipeline is strong across all five of our platforms, a lot of nice new program
opportunities in the pipeline that we're looking at, a lot of opportunities to partner on new distribution channels that
we're excited about. So, a pretty strong pipeline. I would say there's not a lot of large existing programs out there
right now. A lot of them have been locked up, but some really exciting new program opportunities out there. So,
we're excited about that.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2022
Thank you. Just a follow-up on that question. Your late fees are relatively high compared to the industry just given
the amount of accounts you have. So, it naturally would be higher. If the CFPB were to do anything or there was
any regulatory changes, do you feel like you have the flexibility to adjust your model to continue to generate
similar type revenue trends, just given your relationships with other merchants?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Well, so just the first thing I would say that, I mean, we don't disclose the aggregate amount of late fees, but the
late fee dollar amount that we charge on accounts is, again, regulated by the CFPB and very consistent across all
of the general purpose card players out there. And, look, if something were to change on that front, we could price
for it in other ways and protect our revenue and our margin. But, look, I think we just got to stay close to this, as I
said.
And I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The way I think about it, Kevin, is we look at it, the average late fee, for instance, and being that we're in
the safe harbor with the CFPB, it shouldn't be any real difference between us and I'd say industry participants. I
think if you go back historically, under the CARD Act, our revenue when the CARD Act changes went into place,
essentially remained the same. We went back to partners and we worked that.
So, I think, historically, we've had – run the play where if the environment shifts with regard to how the revenue
may or may not be impacted, we'll work with our partners to, again, provide the value to our customers to them
and then return an appropriate risk-adjusted return.

Hey, how are you guys. Just – you talked about the RSA, but just thinking – like RSA, the relationship to rising
delinquencies or charge-offs, what's the timing there? And is it kind of basis point for basis point? And then also,
how do loyalty program costs kind of influence the RSA? Just trying to kind of think about those moving parts
within that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A

Sure. So, if you think about delinquency, John, delinquency should yield higher revolve and higher late fees, that
flows generally immediately through the RSA. The same things with charge-offs. So, when they happen, it goes
immediately. There's no lag, no delay. Loyalty is exact same way. It flows through in the period in which [ph] it's
been counted (54:17).
So, to the extent that you see higher interest and fee yield that will flow through, giving upward bias to the RSA,
charge-offs will give you the downward bias and then either marketing or loyalty, depending upon which program
expense line comes through, that will also provide immediate downward bias through the RSA.

John Hecht Q

Okay. So, it's in that same period we should think about the fluctuation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Correct. The only thing that really fundamentally works more on the lag would be reserves, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Okay. And then, follow-up – second question on a different topic is you had Clover go into play last year,
you developed SetPay, new partners, Venmo, Verizon, maybe can you comment on kind of the contribution this
year of those new partners and products?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. I mean a lot of really exciting growth opportunities in front of us for 2022, John. You hit on a bunch of them.
I would say Venmo and Verizon are doing extraordinarily well, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The feedback
that I get on the Venmo experience is just off the charts. The feedback that we get on the Verizon value prop and
how much you're able to save and the fact that, that card is definitely acting like a top of wallet card, which is
exactly what we intended, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of both of those.
We also launched Walgreens, as you know. It's still very early there, but I think we've got a great customer
experience, very integrated, both in-store, online, mobile, et cetera. And then, Pay in 4, obviously, it's still very
early, but we've got a really good pipeline of partners that we'll be integrating this year.

In addition to individual partner integrations, we're also looking at broader distribution opportunities in Health &
Wellness. We're going to be turning this on in that – in dermatology in the first quarter. We think just given the
ticket size there, it's a product that will really resonate. The providers are excited about it.
So, just a lot to focus on for the team. This is definitely a year of execution. I think we've got the product set that
we want. We made a lot of progress on distribution channels and now it's just getting those products out there as
much as we can, so they're available to consumers and we're laser-like focused on the customer experience.
I mean at the end of the day, that's what's winning out there and you just can't invest enough and making sure
that you can make it really easy to apply for our products, really easy to service and really easy to buy. So, that's
where we're focused, but a lot of exciting things for 2022.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. A question for you on the credit guidance. There has been a lot of investor focus on just kind of the
pace and magnitude of normalization. With that context, just wanted to clarify, when you say peak DQ is expected
in Q4 that – what you're referring to is just that's kind of your seasonal peak for 2022, it's not your assumption of
when you normalize. And if that's the case, how are you kind of thinking about kind of the pace and magnitude of
normalization we'll see?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
First of all, good morning, Mark. When you talk about normalization of delinquencies, that really is going to
happen kind of post peak of losses and we've kind of indicated the peak of charge-offs will be in the first quarter,
maybe early second quarter of 2023. So, it would happen – normalization happens on delinquencies after that.
We expect it to rise.
Now, I think you have to start out with where we start the year at and how that's going to build, we're at low levels,
we haven't seen anything, but it will begin to rise as we step through 2022, which, again, we think is going to be
closely aligned with how payment rate will begin to change. If payment rate remains elevated for longer period,
delinquencies will be slower to rise.
So, I think that's – it's all going to hinge on that payment rate behavior pattern. And I outlined a little bit in our
prepared remarks how we see some movement in there. And I think as payment rate has changed, the one thing
that we've started to notice in some of our cohorts is that, on a unit basis, we see migration back for some cohorts
of accounts back to 2019 levels.
What's happening is that we have another cohort of accounts that have increased spending and increased
payments. And so, on a dollar basis, at the top of the house, it looks like payment rate is not slowing down for
certain pieces. For some pieces of our portfolio, it is clearly migrating back to 2019. So, when that happens more
in total for the portfolio, you'll see delinquency trends, I think, move with it.

Okay. Great. And just on the pace of normalization, if you think about kind of the macro assumptions that you've
made about a stable to improving macro and it contained pandemic, kind of how are you thinking about – without
economic stress, how quickly delinquencies could normalize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Well, typically, vintages take about 18 months to begin to season from a delinquency perspective. So, again,
being that we started some credit refinements in the first quarter this year, you would begin to see some of that
flowing through in the latter part of this year, so the third or fourth quarter, mainly the fourth. So, you'll begin to see
that absent any changes in the macroeconomic environment, just the simple fact that we've unwound certain
things and begun to induce what we would call smart growth with regard to some of our CLIs and upgrade
activities inside our Dual cards and private label book.

Operator: We have time for one final question. From Wolfe Research, we have Bill Carcache. Please go ahead.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hi, Bill.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Brian Doubles, I believe you said that even if payment rates normalize just a little bit, you could see high-single-
digit loan growth. Can you give a little bit more color on what you mean by a little bit? Could that be 50% of 2019
levels?
And, Brian Wenzel, you said there's a scenario where loan growth could be double digit. Could you expand a little
bit more on what that scenario looks like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, look, Bill, I would say we certainly don't need payment rates to come all the way back to pre-pandemic
levels to post high-single-digit loan growth. I mean a modest improvement and just a slight reversion to the mean
and I'm not going to give you basis points here, but would put us in that high-single digits for the full year.
I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. What I'd say, Bill, is our planning process this year, we had multiple scenarios that we ran and we ran it on
varying degrees of how the payment rate evolves. So, there is a scenario where the payment rate slows down
quicker. And in that scenario, given the timing lag on purchase line, you will see potentially under that scenario a
higher rate of growth when it comes to loan receivables.

So, it really is going to hinge off of – I think the important part is what is that payment rate doing and the trend of
the payment rate throughout the entire portfolio as we step through 2022, which would give you the range of
outcomes. But again, when we're printing a mid-teens type of purchase volume growth, it doesn't take a lot on the
payment rate in order to impact the sequential loan growth that we're seeing.
And Brian hit on this earlier. I mean, we are seeing some positive developments in terms of the payment rate in
terms of fewer people paying in full. And so, I think there's some indication that there will be some reversion to the
mean in 2022. It's hard to call exactly when and how much. But, again, if you look at the purchase volume across
the platforms, we feel really good, closing out a record year last year and as you look across all platforms we see
broad-based growth in purchase volume. And we did have every one of our platforms in the fourth quarter, had
positive receivables growth. So, it's a pretty good setup as you look to 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yes. That's really helpful. Thank you. And I guess expanding on some of your earlier comments and sort of
thinking about the interplay between that normalization in payment rates and credit, are you at all concerned over
the risk of credit normalizing faster than payment rates and alternatively, based on what you're seeing in credit,
could there actually an opposite scenario where receivables growth leads credit on the normalization side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Absolutely to the latter part, we could see loan growth going faster than credit normalization. It may be able to
stay there. More likely than not, they're going to move in sync. We do not generally see a scenario where credit
normalization happens and you have elevated payment rates, the way we have. That would be highly unusual
and probably not something we've ever seen before.
