Good morning, everybody, to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our financial results for the First Half
of 2023. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to
you on our website.
I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Héctor Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their
presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator

With this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Héctor, the floor is yours.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Begoña. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me share what we will focus on
today. First, I'll talk about our half one results on the context of how we are progressing with the strategy we
outlined our Investor Day. José will then review our financial performance in greater detail. And then, I'll conclude
with a few closing remarks.
Despite the challenges the financial system experienced at the beginning of the year, Q2 was another strong
quarter for Santander, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our strategy and unique business model even
in times of market volatility. We delivered record profit of €2.7 billion, an increase of 14% compared with Q2 in
2022, that's plus 17% in constant euros.
In the first half of 2023, profit was €5.2 billion, up 7%, supported by robust customer revenue growth. Revenue
increased double digits year-on-year, supported by all regions and global businesses. Global and network
businesses are contributing around 40% of total group revenue. Our numbers of customers grew by 9 million
year-on-year, taking the total to 164 million. And loans increased by 1% and deposits by 5%.
The group continues progressing towards a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation, the
program that is accelerating our structural model change to drive efficiency improvement and growth in
profitability. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved 1.3 percentage points year-on-year to 44.2%, and our net
operating income grew double digits.
On return on tangible equity guarantee, RoTE, rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5%, while our earnings per
shares improved 13% year-on-year, supported by greater profit and share buybacks. At the same time, our strong
balance sheet with solid and sound capital ratio, liquidity at comfortable levels and robust credit quality
contributed to solid profitable growth, value creation and shareholder remuneration. These results allow us to
deliver value creation in terms of TNAV plus EPS year-on-year of 11%, of which represents an increase of more
than €6 billion in the first six months of the year.
Moving on to the income statement, firstly, remember that as we usually do, we are presenting growth rates both
in current euros and constant euros. This quarter, there was no material difference between them. As I have just

mentioned, profit increase in the first half supported by, first of all, a strong line performance with all the regions
and global businesses growing, cost in line with our expectations growing 1% point below the rate of inflation,
double-digit growth in net operating income to approximately €16 billion which demonstrates the strength of our
results, and low loss provisions normalizing in line with our expectations. These trends resulted in our highest
quarterly profit on record, 4% higher than in Q1 even after the following impacts net of taxes recorded in Q2. The
SRF contribution of more than €200 million and additional Swiss mortgage provisions in Poland of €140 million
and one-offs in Brazil of €137 million. José will go into more detail on all of these points later on.
This was a great first half that makes us confident that we will deliver on our 2023 targets. Good business
dynamics are translating into double-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved as a result of good cost
control and revenue trends. Our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at
year-end. CET1 was 12.2% after profitably growing our businesses organically and at comfortable levels allowing
us to accrue the funds to meet our shareholders' remuneration targets of a 50% payout. Our RoTE also grew
year-on-year to 14.5%, on track to reach our target and would already be close to 15% if we don't annualize
extraordinary banking tax on revenue earned in Spain.
As we announced at our Investor Day, we have entered into a new phase of value creation that will help us grow
TNAV per share, plus EPS at double digits during the or through the cycle. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes
updating you on the progress of our transformation plan now that we are six months down the road from our
Investor Day. We are transforming the bank in the right way, because we are structurally changing our model to
improve both cost and revenue. We are making great progress in the implementation of One Transformation,
creating a common operating model and technology for our retail business across our entire footprint, to better
serve our customers and to improve efficiency and to increase the size and profitability of our customer base.
We are delivering across the three pillars of One Transformation. In simplification, we already have reduced 5%
our number of products, nearly 400 fewer products in 2023. We are progressing in our digital self-service model,
increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels, and reducing the use of our contact
center by 17%, just alone in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. We are digitalizing
the onboarding process end-to-end in Mexico. This initial pilot has resulted in a 36% growth in digital accounts per
month compared to those in 2022. And we have already captured around €70 million in savings so far in the US
from transformation and simplification initiatives.
As you can see on the slide, the initial efficiencies for One Transformation and the impact of our [ph] good spread
(00:07:18) management in a context of higher rates – higher interest rates, which our CFO will cover later in
depth, have already contributed 85 basis points in efficiency improvements. Our global and network business
continue contributing to the group's profitability and have already delivered another 43 basis points. Multi-Latinas
and Multi-Europeans, our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through regional
coverage model, are growing at a very high rates, with revenue increasing by more than 70% year-to-date.
In asset management, we have progressed to enter the alternative business. It's starting to serve open market
and institution segment and has reached more than 2 billion commitments already. In payments, we have
deployed Getnet in Portugal and Argentina in the first half and we expect to launching latest in Chile in the second
half. In auto, we are increasing managing OEMs and retail relationships globally, expanding our partnerships in
Europe to LatAm and the US. We have recently onboarded new partners in the USA – in the US, leverage the
existing agreements in Europe, which are expected to materialize in around €4 billion of new business per year.
We have also deployed a new pan-regional leasing platform in two markets, and more countries will be added
throughout 2023 and 2024. Finally, our global technology capabilities have already resulted in 36 basis points

improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture €80 million in
savings this year, mainly driven by, one, efficiencies from the recent development and deployment of Gravity in
two countries which has contributed to with €31 million in savings in the first half. And new global agreements with
vendors which represent around €40 million in cost reduction year-to-date.
The actions that we are beginning to carry out as a part of One Transformation, which we are expanding across
the group are starting to be reflected on cost and on operational efficiencies. As you can see on the slide,
simplification has already driven significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer ratios. The
solid progress we are making with the process digitalization and automation to capture efficiencies enables us to
spend less time on operations in branches and turn the branch network into a powerful sales and advisory
channel. Portugal has already taken out most of the operational activities from the branches, freeing up branch
employees so that they can spend more time supporting customers and commercial activities. We're extrapolating
this to other of our ranks.
In only six months through One Transformation, we have already reduce the number of operational FTEs per
million customers by 3%. We are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience,
leverage economies of scale, and extend best practices. Open Digital Services, as we call it ODS, our cutting-
edge front-end platform, allow us to deliver a best-in-class omni-channel experience to our customers. At the
same time, the Gravity, our award-winning core banking platform, drives significant efficiencies versus mainframe
technology. We have integrated both in the US, so we will operate it on an end-to-end cloud-based retail
technology stack, core and omni-channel, which is already tested and will result in significant improvements in
service quality and customer experience.
Our global and network businesses continue to contribute to this new phase of value creation. In CIB, we continue
growing the strongly after record performance in 2022, beating the market. Our global presence has allowed us to
grow at 24% year-on-year, well above the average of annual growth target of 10% for the period 2022-2025.
Because, first of all, we can provide a one-stop-shop service to our clients across all geographies, thereby
capturing cross-border flows and because we bring CIB products and services to our wealth, retail and
commercial clients across the group and vice versa. As a result, revenue related to these two concepts, which we
call network revenue, grew 27% year-on-year to €2 billion. Wealth management and Insurance grew 25% year-
on-year, well above our target, and this has been boosted by the financial benefits obtained from the Santander
network effect.
A fundamental part of our value proposition in private banking is our unique combination of local presence and
local reach – and global reach. Our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another, and
that's the reason why customers have €50 billion in assets under management booked abroad, 10% higher than
one year ago.
Our payments business is also growing very strongly. Two years ago, we began to move our payments business
on to scaled global platforms. And as of today, our Payments Hub platform already manages a significant part of
all payments in the Eurozone, and we are progressing in another key countries such as Brazil, Mexico and the
UK. We are in the process of expanding our cards platform across the group, delivering real-time digital
processing capabilities to our banks, accelerating our business growth as well as generating operational
synergies of around €100 million per year during the next two years alone. First delivery of the platform will be live
in Brazil by the second half of 2023. In auto, we continue to prioritize profitability over market share growth in a
context of rising interest rates.

Our transformation plan, which is making us more – much more efficient and increasing contribution of our global
and network businesses, is helping us reach our 2025 profitability targets across all regions and businesses. As I
mentioned earlier, the group's RoTE rose 80 basis points year-on-year to 14.5% and would be around 15% if we
[ph] didn't annualize (00:13:54) the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which is in line with the group's targets for
2022 – sorry, 2023 and 2025.
José will now go in more detail to the group's first half performance. Please, José.

Thank you, Héctor. And good morning, everyone. [audio gap] (00:14:16-00:14:38) tailwinds and Latin America
driven by growth in volumes and fees. Digital Consumer Bank benefited from asset repricing actions and gains on
financial transactions due to FX hedges. We also saw a strong performance across businesses. The only
exception was auto. The result of lower leasing income in the US, which as in previous quarters, was affected by
an increase in the share of end-of-lease vehicles repurchased at the dealership. Revenue at the Corporate Centre
also improved, up nearly €400 million, due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from FX
hedging which negatively affected revenue last year.
Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued its upward trend, increasing 6% in the quarter alone,
driven in particular by Europe. We see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters.
First half 2023 was 15% higher year-on-year in constant euros, with positive sensitivity to raising rates mainly in
Europe and Mexico, and volume growth in auto, North America and South America, which more than offset
negative interest rate sensitivity in Brazil, Chile on auto.
In terms of profitability, we have improved our margins every quarter since the first quarter of 2021. We'll continue
to actively manage our credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment. Gains from credit
yields outweighed higher funding costs, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration strategy adapted to each
country's specific needs.
In Europe, we are strictly managing deposit costs, especially in Spain and Portugal, where there is excess
liquidity in the system and much lower credit demand. The UK has a more competitive environment in line with
our expectations.
In LatAm, deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates, which implies negative sensitivity and will
benefit margins when rates start to decline over the next few months.
Finally, in the US, deposit betas are higher due to the heightened competition following the collapse of Silicon
Valley Bank. All in all, net interest income sensitivity to interest rates has resulted on €500 million above the
assumptions that we shared during our Investor Day. Therefore, we are well on track to meet our double-digit NII
growth guidance for 2023.
Turning now to fees, in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subpar loan demand, weaker
activity, consumer activity and higher margins, our net fee income grew at 4% in the quarter compared with the
same quarter last year and 5% in the first half year-on-year.
CIB and PagoNxt are leading the way in terms of growth. CIB is increasing its share of leading roles and
mandates. And PagoNxt continued to expand total payment volumes, which rose 25% year-on-year, and

transactions 32%. We also had a very good performance for cards, with turnover increasing 9% year-on-year,
with fees growing 20%.
Retail Banking also continued to grow well, primarily driven by an increase in customers and transactionality.
Wealth Management and Insurance grew less as customers moved to lower-risk fixed income products with lower
fees and margins. However, we saw volume improvements in both private banking, net new money of €6.5 billion,
and Santander Asset Management over €3 billion net sales. Auto performance year-on-year was affected by the
new insurance regulation in Germany in the first quarter, but recovered significantly in the second quarter.
In terms of costs, our transformation efforts that Héctor took you through earlier, are paying off. Despite initial
investments, cost in real terms are growing below the rate of inflation across most of our footprint, reflecting the
savings we are beginning to generate on our strict cost control. This in turn is reflected in efficiency improvements
led by Europe, which improved 7 percentage points, thanks to strong revenue gains, together with a 2% fall in
costs in real terms. As a result, group efficiencies were really at the bottom end of our target range, where we
expect it to remain for the rest of the year.
Credit quality remains robust across our footprint. The non-performing loan ratio remained stable in the context of
an expected soft landing and strong labor markets, as unemployment is a key driver of credit quality. Of note, with
the positive trends in Brazil driven by the more selective lending policies that we introduced a year and a half ago.
We said in the fourth quarter of last year that we believe the Brazil NPL ratio had already peaked and trends so
far this this year support that view, having improved almost 60 basis points year-to-date.
In terms of cost of risk, we remain comfortably on track to meet our 2023 target to remain below 1.2%. Spain
continues to perform well with a 12-month cost of risk down 16 basis points year-on-year, supported by the quality
of the loan book and improving macro conditions. Normalization in the US continues but is more resilient than
anticipated. Brazil remains elevated due to the unsecured individual borrowers' portfolio, but we are seeing signs
that cost of risk has stabilized. Brazil's 12-month cost of risk at the end of June was 4.74%, but if we annualize the
first six months, that improved to 4.5%. Mexico is increasing from low levels, mainly due to a changing mix
towards unsecured loans, which require more provisions upfront and obviously more – is more profitable. Other
units such as the UK, Portugal and the Digital Consumer Bank are rising but from a very low base and should
remain below all in line with through-the-cycle averages.
Moving on to our balance sheet structure, as we have discussed in previous presentations, our credit portfolio is
well diversified by segment, product and country. Moreover, our balance sheet is low risk. The portfolio is highly
secured with quality collateral and has low average loan-to-values. Loan growth year-on-year was flat in constant
euros, as growth in auto and consumer was offset by falls in CIB, mainly in Spain from very high levels in 2022,
mortgages driven by early repayments in Europe, and slowing demand from corporates also in Europe. We saw
positive dynamics in North America, South America, and DCB.
On the other hand, deposits continued to grow well, up 4% year on year following a €3 billion increase in the
second quarter in constant euros, reflecting new customer capture, which more than offset mortgage
prepayments. We saw growth across the bank concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher
rates. Our deposit base is diversified and highly stable. Using LCR criteria, 75% of our deposits are transactional,
which are stickier, and a high proportion for deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes.
We have not seen any unusual movements in deposits in the year-to-date following market turmoil, particularly in
the US. In fact, deposits in the US grew in the quarter, remained flattish year-to-date, which implies that we are
7

gaining market share in deposits and with an average cost which was well below our main competitors. Mutual
funds have begun to recover, up 4% year-on-year following a year of instability in 2022.
To close, let me cover capital. Our fully loaded capital ratio remained at a comfortable level of 12.2%, backed by a
strong organic capital generation, which was again 10 basis points net of dividend accrual in the quarter. We
accounted for the buyout of the minority shareholders in Mexico, which costs 4 basis points in terms of capital.
We also had a series of other small positives and negatives this quarter that almost offset each other. We
continued to focus on profitable growth opportunities, which is reflected in a front book RoRWA of 2.9%, up from
2.5% in the first half of 2022, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity in excess of 15%. So in excess of
the current group return on tangible equity, which will support profitability going forward. Additionally, we
continued to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of risk-weighted assets with positive
economic value-added, progressing well towards our Investor Day target of 85% in 2025. This increased
profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years, and we are confident our capital ratio will
remain above 12%, even after taking into account the final implementation of Basel III on January 1, 2025.
Let me turn it back to Héctor for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. In summary, Q2 of 2023 was another strong quarter supported by customer growth, double-digit
revenue increase, and also backed by strong performance by all the regions and businesses. We are accelerating
the structural change to a simpler and more integrated model through One Transformation, is spreading the
initiative all across the group, which is driving efficiency improvement and also profitable growth. A rock solid
balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth, value creation and shareholder remuneration.
In summary, we have a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will achieve our 2023
targets and remunerate our shareholders in line with our 50% payout policy, supported by our global and network
businesses, while we continue with our structural model transformation. We see upside potential for further net
interest income growth in the coming quarters, as tailwinds in Europe and Mexico are expected to remain and
inflation and interest rates in our largest Latin American market – Latin American countries seem to have peaked
or nearly peaked, resulting in a positive outlook for margins in the next six to nine months.
Cost of risk is normalizing in line with our expectation in a context of an expected soft landing of the economy and
strong labor markets. We continue to see resilient customer and corporate behavior in most of the geographies.
Group RoTE has reached 14.5% in the first half and we expect to close about 15% at the end of the year. All in
all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing at the double digit, well on track with our target of average growth
through the cycle.
And now, we would be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call – my question. The first question would actually be on Brazil.
Margin stabilized quarter-on-quarter, still a bit under pressure year-on-year. I was wondering what type of
evolution you expect for the rest of the year? And also on cost of risk, what's the outlook there?
Then the second question would actually be on capital. So basically, the capital generation in this quarter was
only 3 basis points, a bit below the run rate you have discussed in previous quarters. I reckon that this partially
has to do with the [ph] Mexico minority's incorporation (00:27:19), but I was wondering how do you see this
evolving for throughout the rest of the year? And also what is behind the increase in RWAs in the – in this
quarter? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Carlos. What I'll do is I'll answer the first question on Brazil. We'll give a comment on capital, and then
José will tell you a little bit about what's going on with increase in RWA, okay?
In terms of the Brazil margin quarter-on-quarter, as we say, basically is explained by the following: On launch
since 2021, we have become much more conservative and growth – and growing volumes very selectively,
changing the loan mix to lower risk. Okay? So, we mainly get out of credit cards, went on to consignado, auto
loans and mortgages.
On deposits, also the fast increasing rates has mean a rapid rise in the cost of deposits, okay, as well as a
change of the mix on the deposits. Rates are staying higher for longer has prevented that the cost of deposits
from coming down impacting NII. Remember that in Brazil we have negative sensitive – sensitivity to rates, okay?
So Brazil NIIs in the second quarter of 2023 is already flat, okay? As we said and José was very precise on that,
the worst seems to be behind us and we're already seeing a reduction on the average cost of deposits and we
also see an improved customer spread, okay? So, we expect NII in the second half of 2023 to be higher than the
first half of the year, leading to a flat NII in the year with a substantial improvement in 2024. Okay?
In terms of the cost of risk, not only the macro outlook is improving, but since 2021, as just I explained, we've
been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate
customers as I explained, okay? This is showing good results and we believe the worst, as I said repeatedly, is
worst – sorry, the worst is behind now.
Cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving versus the first quarter and the vintages are showing really
good performance as we have seen. So, we don't expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in Brazil in 2023 versus
2022, excluding the one-off that – which implies us staying close to around 4.6%. Okay?
And then to be on capital, to be very precise, we expect to generate at least 10 basis points of organical capital on
average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place. As a result, we will be
9


Banco Santander SA

on track to meet our target to be above 12% even when the final implementation of Basel III comes into effect on
January 1st on 2025, okay?
And with that, I don't know, José, if you can comment on RWAs, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Thank you. So, morning, Carlos. You're right, loan growth was zero, but risk-weighted assets grew more or
less 2%. Half of that growth is due to FX as we consolidate the Latin American, basically the peso and the
Brazilian-based assets into the group. Of the other half, half of the other half, so a substantial amount
corresponds to a stock finance. And this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in Europe and this will
eventually translate into auto loans. So, this is obviously short-term that will eventually lead to higher profitability
going forward.
When we look at the outlook, as Héctor said, we don't expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital
impacts in the second half of the year. We see no inorganic charges in the second half of the year. Obviously, it
looks like the available-for-sale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable. We see improving profitability, as
we have mentioned, particularly driven by higher NII in the second half, and risk-weighted assets that should be
probably under control. So, net-net, we see a stronger capital – organic capital generation in the next couple of
quarters, again leading to a capital that will remain well above 12% every quarter and building up sufficient capital
to be above 12% post Basel III.

Operator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions, please, from my side on US and Spain.
US has obviously done much better in provisions. I know you've touched on it, Héctor, but maybe you can give a
bit more detail as to why the provision was so low in the quarter. Is it collateral? Is it default rates? And when you
think about the rest of the year, maybe you can update us about the guidance. What do you expect in cost of risk
for the full year? I think you gave us some color in Q1, maybe an updated view or the moving parts there.
And second question on Spain, deposits much more stable this quarter, previous quarter. I wonder if you can give
again a bit more color on the deposit migration, remuneration, and when do you – would you expect NII to peak in
Spain? I'm extrapolating Spain, Portugal, which I assume has the same dynamics. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Alvaro. Okay. Let me give you an outlook in the US. Okay? And I explained it. it's basically the same
dynamic as I explained you on the first quarter, okay? Credit provision, as you know, decreased as credit quality
is remaining robust and credit net charge-offs, actually what we call realized losses, showed better-than-
anticipated performance. And this is basically on the back of US prices continued to be strong, okay, as I
explained, and declined at slower pace than we previously anticipated.

The change in auto loans portfolio mix are more primed. Remember that I told you that before 2018, we had a lot
more subprime than prime and the change on the mix has helped. Also, we have robust and better-than-expected
labor market in the US, okay, which is sustaining that. Okay? And auto customers that are delinquent, exactly as I
was explaining in the first quarter, for more than 90 days are rolling into charge-off status at historically low levels.
Okay. Normally, they were above 90%, 95%. Last quarter, they were around 59%. This quarter, around 67%.
Okay? So it's still much better than we expect and much better than it was actually happening pre-COVID. Okay?
And in that, in 2023, we expect cost of risk to continue under normalization at around 2% and after two years of
artificially low figures given COVID, et cetera. As I was saying, normalized levels should be below pre-pandemic,
cost of risk at around – if you remember pre-pandemic was around 2.85%. It's never going to get there, okay,
because of the change of mix and what I was explaining, okay?
In terms of the Spain, okay. In Spain, the deposits, I mean, continued to be stable, okay, at around – we have
€299 billion. Okay. We have excess liquidity in Santander Spain to the LTDs around 78%, as this is the case for
the whole Spanish system that is around 80%. Quarterly decline is mostly into CIB deposits, flat in Retail in the
quarter despite the early repayments of mortgages, okay, 60% compared to the same period of 2022, and the
increased volume of deposits moving off balance sheet products.
Also, what we see between the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022 is plus 0.9%. Okay? So, we have a
different change on the mix with time deposits going up at around 61% up year-on-year, while demand deposits
are going down around 5% on the back of the higher rates, driven by the growth of CIB, which allows us to
maintain also our – and maintain a stable net liquidity position. Okay?
In terms of what I was saying, NII, we don't expect too big yet. I mean, we have still revisions and I will have José
explaining in detail exactly how we see NII evolution in Spain.

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Morning, Alvaro. Let me talk about the Corporate Centre of Santander SA more than Spain, because this is going
to give you a better view of our euro sensitivity to rates in the – in Spain. So, we have assets of €330 billion, 60%
floating, 40% fixed. This fixed includes the ALCO, which is €27 billion that we've been buying recently, with an
average duration of six years and an interest rate of over 3%.
We also have intra-group transactions, et cetera, money markets that are fixed, but these are very short-term, so
they will reprice as short-term Euribor actually goes up. Of the floating €200 billion, €65 billion will reprice or
reprices with 12-month Euribor. We expect the – if we use today's 12 month Euribor compared with the average
of the first half, so let's assume that the Euribor remains flat in the first half of next year, we have at least 50 basis
points pickup in the repricing of this part of the portfolio next year. And then we have €60 billion – sorry, €30
billion, we've repriced it with the six months, €40 billion with the three months and €65 billion with one month. So,
we would still expect significant repricing upwards in the first half of next year as interest rates in Europe may go
up once or twice, but as they stabilize, we will still have significant repricing of a big chunk of the portfolio in the
first half of next year.
So, obviously, the asset yields are expected still to expand well into 2024. Obviously, margins will depend on the
cost of deposits, but we – as Héctor said, we're not seeing any pressures today to increase the remuneration of
retail deposits. We are already paying almost Euribor for CIB deposits, institutional deposits, but we don't see any

pressures on the retail side of deposits, which means that probably the peak in net interest margins will not
happen until well into 2024 in the Eurozone.

Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
I wanted to ask about NII in the UK and in the US, if you can please update your guidance in the UK. I see lending
is weak, falling, local mortgage market is declining, asset spreads are low, the deposit betas is still relatively low,
how do you see all these dynamics going forward on the NII?
And also in the US, you are gaining market share, but are you gaining new clients or do pay enough for deposits?
How do you see the beta compared to the local peers and – on absolute terms going forward on the NII there in
the US? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. Okay. Let me give you all the details, okay? In the – let's talk about first about the UK. NII
was up double-digit in the first half of 2023, okay? It was driven mainly by higher rates and a strong focus on
money and spreads, and profitability, although the UK tends to be more competitive than other European
markets, as you know, okay?
So, we're putting profitability ahead of market share, okay? And we have a lower risk appetite, but we're expecting
good performance to continue leading to NIM expansion, okay? So, we expect it to stable – to stabilize towards
the second half, okay, 2023 with a high single-digit growth on higher rates, and despite the lower volumes that we
have because of why you explained about profitability. Okay?
In the second quarter, NII was flattish. Okay? Higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding
and the slowdown in new originations. Okay?
In terms of the betas, José will tell you afterwards that I tell you about what's going on in the US.
In terms of the US, overall, as you have seen, has been better than expected given the change of mixed over
prime. Okay? As I explained in detail, lower yield, but also the risk profile and the lower grade provisioning is
helping us. Okay? NII is flattish in the quarter and year-on-year on funding pressures on the wholesale and retail.
As you know, a lot of this is funded by wholesale as well. And a common trend across the sector which has been
partially offset by higher yields that we have.
Santander US betas are above what we expected but lower than the average of our peers, just to give you exactly
what's going on. And we expect NII to be down mid-single-digit on lower originations and also the higher funding
pressure, again, in line with the peers.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
However, given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first
half, the US NII could do better than we expect, okay? US NII is not the only one that has been better. Cost of risk
and profitability are also better than expected in the country. Okay?
So, José, I don't know, you can comment on the betas, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
On the betas, in the UK, when we look at cost of deposits today relative to the level of rates today, that's around
slightly below 30%. It's increasing slightly in the quarter, 3 percentage points. We still think that it will continue. So,
the UK market with less excess liquidity than Spain, for instance. So, we would expect, as Héctor said, that
margins probably – they were stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to
remain more or less flattish in the third and probably slightly going down from there.
In the US, as Héctor said, we kept our deposits flat, paying less than our regional bank competitors. The beta in
the US is 36.8%, up 2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. So after the spike that we saw in February, March,
the betas in the US have remained very stable. And we are actually increasing deposit market share at a lower
cost than our competitors.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is one of the Spanish loan book, if you
could update a bit on the trends that we have seen in the quarter. Year-on-year, I do see an 8% decline. If you
could elaborate a bit on what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward?
And the second question is a bit at a group level. If I just look to the first half cost of risk, it's around 106 basis
points. You are sticking to the guidance below 120 basis points. Is there any region besides the US where we
could see some deterioration in the second half that makes to keep that conservative guidance, which would
imply a run rate of around 175 basis points, 140 basis points in the second half to make the 120 basis points?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. Let me tell you a little bit about what's the dynamics on the Spanish loan book, and then José
will talk about your second question. Okay? In the Spanish loan book, the dynamic that we have seen is quite
clear. Okay? We have seen low demand of credit, okay, which is impacting us a little bit, mainly also we have
seen an increase on the prepayment mainly on the mortgages, okay, because of the increased rates. Remember
that a lot of our big percentage of our portfolio is from variable rates and floating rate. So, in that sense, that's the
dynamic that we have seen. And also we have seen, due to the increased rates, the corporates and the SMEs
being more cautious in new credit demand. Okay? And the dynamics we live throughout the year continuing that
13


Banco Santander SA

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
way, let's see what happens at the beginning of the year and also if we can see more confidence a little bit on
investment. Okay? But now, we see the dynamics in that way.
Please, José, on the second one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Good morning, Ignacio. Cost of risk, well, we see cost of risk normalizing in the US as we discussed. Also, in
Mexico, where we are seeing the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business – the business mix.
In auto, it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to sell, but it should remain stable in the
second half of the year. So, we feel very comfortable that we will beat our 1.2% guidance for the end of the year.
We expect it to be better than the 1.2% that we gave as a guidance.

Operator: Next question from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my questions. Sir, can you just explain there the difference
between your reported net interest income which was €10.5 billion and the underlying €10.7 billion? What
explains the €200 million delta and are there any more one-offs in net interest income that we should be aware of,
I mean, in the short-term?
And then, the second question would be on the capital headwind. You mentioned that you expect it to remain
above 12%. But can you just outline what capital or core equity Tier 1 headwinds you are expecting in the coming
quarters or at least on the year-end? And also, if you could remind us what the Basel IV impacts are? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, [ph] Francois (00:47:18). So, José will explain to you the NII evolution. On capital, let me
reiterate exactly what I said and then José can expand a little bit. So, as I told you, we expect to generate at least
10 basis points of organic capital on average per quarter. Okay? And with – that is included with the current
remuneration policy that we have. Okay? So, as a result, what I told you, we will be on track to meet our target to
be above 12% also with the final implementation of Basel III comes into effect in 2025 to be precise on that point.
José will comment a little bit more on that and explain to you the NII evolution.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So, Sofie, hi. Good morning. As I said, we don't expect any headwinds – significant headwinds from any of
the three big components that could affect capital, regulatory or supervisory charges, inorganic charges, or other
charges, basically market-related pensions, intangibles, we don't significant headwinds in the second half of the
year.

In terms of Basel III, we have seen the proposal, is still a proposal. So, we need to wait to see exactly how is –
how the regulation is approved. We still think we will have an impact of between 40 basis points to 60 basis points
probably. And again, depending on how this is finally written, probably towards the lower end of that range if
things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved.
In terms of the accounting. Well, I think Investor Relations will give you more details about this. This is pretty
detailed. But in the first half, there is no impact, no adjustments between net interest income, statutory and
underlying. Zero. What happened in the first quarter is we had a net positive adjustment of €211 million and we
have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter, which by the way, in terms of the €20 billion, it's a
very small amount.
So, no adjustment to NII in the first half. What we added to underlying in the first quarter was reversed in the
second quarter. There are other adjustments in the P&L, but basically netting out in most cases will happen in the
first quarter, in the second quarter. But Investor Relations will give you all the details line-by-line of the differences
between the first and the second quarter. Thanks, Sofie.

Operator: Next question from Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marta Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you very much. My first question is on the Digital Bank. Could you please provide an update on your
strategy for gathering deposits here? You've raised roughly €3.4 billion year-to-date. That seems a bit below what
you had planned a few months ago. And then deposit ratio is running at 200%. So, how much more deposits do
you expect to get and where do you feel like you need to put rate in order to be more successful in Northern
Europe and Germany? The second question is a follow-up on mortgages in the UK. You are shrinking pretty fast,
€4 billion per quarter. When do you expect to stabilize that book? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Marta. Okay. On the strategy terms, the Openbank is quite clear. Okay? And we just don't have
Openbank as the only vehicle to raise deposits. We have some other vehicles also we have in some of the other
different countries. Okay? We believe that the strategy is right and the one that we manage with Openbank is
going along our expectations and we believe that we are going to continue to manage that accordingly. Okay?
And in the some other different initiatives that we have, for example, in Germany and some other places, the
strategy has been proving very successful, and we don't believe we need to basically continue raising rates
depending on what the market reacts to it. Okay? So, we're going to be moving it according to the market.
In terms of mortgages in the UK, I was very specific about what we're thinking in terms of profitability, okay, and
the way we're managing the portfolio. First of all, we've been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk
appetite is being very prudent in the way we're managing the UK. Okay? If we see there is a change of how we
see the market, then we'll adjust at the point. But right now, we're concentrated in the two things I told you. First of
15


Banco Santander SA

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
all, profitability, and being cautious on the risk appetite there. If we see one of these changes, then we'll adjust in
anyway. I don't know, José, if you'd like to comment on that a bit more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
In the Digital Consumer Bank, that now includes Openbank, we have €60 billion in deposits, like you said. And I
think we obviously manage that to maximize profitability. So, it's not only a question of the amount of deposits, but
the question is managing the margins in a business that has negative sensitivity to rates. And I think we've been
very successful. If you compared this figure to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and
interest rate sensitivity management, I think you have to look at the whole picture. And I think we've been very
successful in managing interest rate sensitivity in a business that is naturally – has naturally negative sensitivity to
recent rates.

Operator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. And the question, [indiscernible] (00:53:13-00:53:20) going to the different geographies and particularly
you've given a lot of detail on NII in a lot of countries. Can you do the same for Brazil, please?
The second question is on Spain. If you could split the drivers of NII there between bit of increases in interest
rates of deposit beta and the ALCO portfolio contribution? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Andrea. Let me explain a little bit the NII in Brazil, and then José will give you the details of the
drivers of NII and the betas in Spain, okay – in Spain. So, to start, I mean, Brazil NII, okay, performance in recent
quarters explained. First of all, on loans, since 2021, I've been very specific on that. We have become very much
conservative and we have changed the mix. Okay? And we have grown volumes selectively, okay, changing the
loan mix to lower risk. On deposits, okay, the fast increasing rates means a rapid rise in the cost of deposits.
Okay? We expect NII in the second half of 2023 to be higher than in the first half of the year, leading to a flat NII
in the year with a substantial improvement in 2024. Okay?
If we see that the rates basically start to come down, because it's very important to understand that Brazil has
negative sensitivity to the rates, we should gain traction and we maintain – we're going to maintain our cautious
stance, but we believe that we can go back to the market. Okay? And we believe that [ph] functional (00:55:05)
rates could fall in the second half, bringing the cost down in retail funding. Okay?
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
And then in the drivers of NII in Spain and also we give you more details, Spain is one of the countries that has
benefited most from the higher rates. Okay? We continue to see strong growth in clients. Just in the first half of
the year, we have 300,000 more active clients. Okay? NII in Spain is up around 57% in the first half of the year
and 60% just alone in the second quarter. It's mostly supported by repricing of the loan portfolio, the higher yields,
and remain contained on the cost of deposits. So, we have been managing very well in that sense.
We expect double-digit growth for NII in 2023. And regarding the peak of NII in Spain, there are several things to
consider that José already explained you. Assets will continue to reprice at least during the first half of 2024.
Clients, which we expect, will continue to grow. And betas, which will be key, are – we're still seeing a rational
competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid. Okay? So as of today, we don't
expect much higher remuneration on the foreseeable future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So hi, Andrea. The ALCO in Spain, we have €27 billion. ALCO €21 billion is a structural long-term held-to-collect
with an average maturity of – duration of 7.7 years and a yield of 3.3%, 3.4%. And then we have €6 billion, which
is more associated with short-term liquidity management, average duration of 1.2 years and yields slightly below
3%.
We expect to continue increasing the amount of the ALCO portfolio in Spain to gradually reposition the balance
sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity, because as interest rates start reaching a peak, we don't want to run a
balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates. So, one way of doing that is not the only, we are also
taking other measures, but one way is obviously increasing the ALCO portfolio.
In terms of betas, the beta for deposits in Spain is 17.8%. If we exclude CIB, by the way, this is 3 percentage
points higher than in the first quarter. If we exclude CIB, the beta is 9.5%. The beta in CIB is around 60%. So, I
think I've given you all the numbers to figure it out exactly how we see the betas and the NII going forward.
Thanks.

Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah. Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give a bit more color on the NII increase, the absolute
NII increase in Spain Q-on-Q? The customer spread was up less in the previous quarter, but NII was up a lot
more. And then secondly, could also update us on the net interest income sensitivity in Brazil over one year and
two years. And lastly, on the €500 million rate benefits that you see more so than previously, can you give us an
idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current run rate? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, let me go backwards here. Yeah. In the first half, the sensitivity was more or less €500 million higher
than what we – the guidance we gave in at the Investor Day. We would expect more or less a similar amount in
17


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
the second half in euros. So, we – relative to the figures we gave at Investor Day, the interest rate sensitivity in
euros due to the fact that, obviously, rates are higher and we are seeing betting betas, remember that the betas
we used to give that sensitivity at Investor Day in euros was around 30%. We are below 20% right now and it's
already half of the year. So, we would expect another €500 million more in the second half, over €1 billion higher
than what we mentioned at Investor Day.
NII sensitivity in Brazil. I'm going to give you the rest of the currencies as well. So, if today we had 100 basis
points parallel shift upwards, we would make €1.1 billion, €1.2 billion more in euros, €250 million more in the UK,
flat and slightly negative in the US, and €100 million less in Brazil. I think we gave you all the details to
understand the NII sensitivity in Spain. But we can take it offline and if you wanted more detailed analysis, but I
think we gave you all the details. I'll give you the composition of the balance sheet by repricing on the asset side.
So, I think that's sufficient, I think, but we will take it offline.

Hi. Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up from me on capital. You mentioned
the stock finance impact, could you please quantify that in terms of stock and one single specific impact on risk-
weighted assets just to clear that out some of the impact? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, the stock finance is seasonal. It tends to go up in December, which is the peak in the year, then goes –
it goes down in March, goes up a little bit in June and then same in September, to peak again in December. This
year, the increase in June was higher than we expected. We are talking around €6 billion in total risk-weighted
assets from stock finance in the first half.

Okay. So, Fernando, let me tell you exactly how we are in Poland, okay? Up to today, okay, and with the extra
that we did, okay, we believe that is completely adequate, okay? We're talking about that in the blended
provisions that we have, we are provisioned up to 58%, okay, of the outstanding that we have, okay? And we
believe that's enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there, given the dynamics that we have seen
in the market. And if you're basically changing to a [indiscernible] (01:03:36) when the – these mortgages has
started, they'll be about there, okay? So I believe that we're at the right point and we believe the provisions at this
level is completely adequate, okay? On the second, I will have José....

José Antonio García Cantera A

...I explained, loan growth year-on-year was zero. Risk-weighted assets increased 2%, half of which is FX. And I
can take you through the composition of risk-weighted assets by country, but half of the risk-weighted asset
inflation has to do with FX.
Of the other half, we had some positives and negatives. As I said, we have contraction in the UK. We have
contraction in terms of risk-weighted assets, ex-stock finance in auto, and slight contraction in Europe. And then,
we had the stock finance expansion in Europe and also risk-weighted asset growth both in FX effects in Mexico
and in Brazil.

Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, it's just a quick follow-up on Brazil. If you can give us a little bit more color or at least
ballpark magnitude of the substantial growth of NII you're expecting in 2024? And the sensitivity to rate also was
mentioned and suggests probably around, yeah 1% for 100 basis points decline. So, just trying to understand
basically what kind of magnitude in terms of acceleration of NII you are expecting next year in Brazil? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hector Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Ignacio. I will answer the first part of the question and then José will help me out with the rest.
Okay? This is sensitivity. What I told you is that we believe that the worst is over in Brazil, okay, and we're starting
to see a little bit more growth in the portfolio. Okay? So, we're changing that around. We're starting to basically go
back to the open market, which in 2021 we decided basically to come out of it given the – what we saw in the
current environment. Okay?
So at this point, we believe that Brazil is going to be able to turn around. And also we see that the rates are going
to be helping us out, because we believe that the rate in August should start coming down. So in that sense, we
don't know exactly how the trends are going to work, but we see that is – this is coming much better than we
expect. Okay? And we see that we're going to end up the year basically flattish to where we started. Okay?

So, hi, Ignacio. We believe interest rates in Brazil will start coming down in August. They are at 13.75%, our
central scenario is for rates to end the year at around 12%, 12.25%, and then probably below 10% by the end of
next year. So NII, when you look at sequentially quarter-on-quarter, NII probably will be flattish in the third, but it
should increase in the fourth and more so into next year. And the exact sensitivity, I mentioned the sensitivity to
higher rates. But the sensitivity in Brazil to 100 basis point, but this is a parallel shift, I insist the parallel shift which
is not will happen probably, because what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve, but flattish in the
long end of the curve. But through a parallel shift, a drop in 100 basis points will generate €140 million higher
revenue in Brazil. Thank you, Ignacio.
