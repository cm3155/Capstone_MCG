Brian Mauney
Director-Investor Relations, KeyCorp
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining KeyCorp's second quarter 2024
earnings conference call. I'm here with Chris Gorman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Clark
Khayat, our Chief Financial Officer.
As usual, we will reference our earnings presentation slides, which can be found in the Investor Relations section
of the key.com website. In the back of the presentation, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosures
and certain financial measures, including non-GAAP measures. This covers our earnings materials, as well as
remarks made on this morning's call. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements, and
those statements speak only as of today, July 18, 2024, and will not be updated.
With that, I will turn it over to Chris.

Thank you, Brian. I'm on slide 2. This morning, we reported earnings of $237 million, or $0.25 per share, which is
down $0.02 from the year-ago quarter, but up $0.05 sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue was
essentially flat as we offset the expected pullback in investment banking fees from a record first quarter with
growth across the balance of the franchise. Expenses remained well controlled and credit costs were stable.
Importantly, we continued to deliver on our clearly defined path to enhance profitability as we – that we detailed a
little over a year ago.
Net interest income grew from what we continue to believe will be this cycle's low in the first quarter. And we
remain confident in our ability to deliver on our NII commitments for both the full-year 2024, as well as the fourth
quarter exit rate. Deposit value creation continues to be a positive story for Key. This quarter, deposits grew by
1% sequentially, while the pace of increase in deposit costs continued to decelerate. Additionally, noninterest-
bearing deposits stabilized at 20% of total deposits. We were also pleased to see client deposits up 5% year-
over-year. Consumer relationship households are up 3.3% annualized year-to-date. Finally, we continue to be
very disciplined with respect to pricing. Our cumulative deposit beta stands at 53% since the Fed began raising
interest rates.
With respect to noninterest income, we have made continued progress against our most important strategic
initiatives. In our Wealth Management business, targeting mass affluent prospects, production volumes hit
another record in the second quarter as we added 5,600 households and over $600 million of household assets to
the platform. Since launching this business in March of last year, we have added over 31,000 households and
about $2.9 billion of new household assets to Key.

Within our existing customer base, we believe we have a great opportunity. Over 1 million Key retail households
have investable assets of over $250,000, and only about 10% are existing customers in our investment relation –
in our investment business. Overall, as a company, our assets under management have now reached $57.6
billion.
In Commercial Payments, we continue to see strength in our commercial deposits, with 9% growth year-over-year
and a relatively flat beta since year-end. Cash management fees are growing at approximately 10%. Our primacy
focus has made this a core competency for us. We continue to see momentum as our clients are more focused
than ever on working capital solutions and driving efficiency in their own businesses. Additionally, our focus on
verticals like healthcare, real estate and technology create meaningful deposit opportunities, and our embedded
banking strategy was well-timed given the growth we're seeing in that market.
In Investment Banking, as we have previously communicated, our second quarter fees were below those of the
first quarter. Our positive outlook for the business, however, remains unchanged. Our pipelines are higher today
than last quarter, year-end, and year-ago levels. Our M&A pipeline remains near record levels, and the near-term
outlook for other Investment Banking fee revenue streams have improved.
At this point, we expect a stronger second half of the year, consistent with our prior guidance. Our national third-
party commercial loan servicing business also continues to perform well. This is a countercyclical business that
also gives us unique insight into the commercial real estate market. We continue to feel very good about our
growth prospects for this business.
Lastly, on loans. Broadly, loan demand remains tepid, and the pricing environment remains competitive. It is also
taking some time after our focus on improving our liquidity and capital ratios last year to get our machine fully up
to speed. Despite recent volume trends, we are optimistic we will start to see stabilization and potentially some
growth in the back half of the year. Our pipelines are building. In the middle market, our pipelines are over 50%
higher than last quarter. And in our institutional business, engagements broadly are picking up as well.
Turning to capital. This quarter, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio improved by roughly another 20 basis points to
10.5%. Our marked CET1 and tangible capital ratios also improved. As reported a few weeks ago, we have
received the results of the Fed's stress test or DFAST, which implied a preliminary stress capital buffer for Key of
3.1%, which is up 60 basis points from the SCB we received in 2022.
I'll make just a few comments. First, even under this preliminary buffer, we have plenty of excess capital. Our
10.5% CET1 ratio compares to what would be a new 7.6% implied minimum. So, the results continue to illustrate
our strong capital position. Secondly, we, like others in our industry, don't have insight into the Fed's models. The
Fed's model for loan losses for Key, particularly for our commercial real estate and first-lien mortgage portfolios
are inconsistent with our internally run stress tests. We look forward to a continued constructive dialogue with our
regulators on this topic.
Looking forward, I am excited about what lies ahead for Key. We have been discussing our net interest income
pivot for each of the last several quarters. The pivot is now upon us. NII headwinds that we have experienced will
now become NII tailwinds as we go forward. Concurrently, I'm also encouraged by the business momentum we
continue to see across the franchise. We demonstrated momentum in Wealth Management and Commercial
Payments begin this past quarter, and we are driving meaningful client deposit growth across the entire franchise.
Lastly, investment banking and loan pipelines are up meaningfully from prior periods.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Clark to provide more details on our financial results. Clark?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Clark H. I. Khayat
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Now, on slide 4. For the second quarter, as Chris
mentioned, we reported earnings per share of $0.25, up $0.05 per share versus the first quarter or $0.03 per
share adjusting for last quarter's FDIC special assessment. Sequentially, revenue was essentially flat, down 0.5%,
as a 1.5% increase in net interest income was offset by a 3% decline in noninterest income, while expenses
declined more meaningfully by 6%, or 4% excluding FDIC assessment impacts.
Credit costs were stable and included roughly $10 million build to our allowance for credit losses this quarter. On
a year-over-year basis, EPS declined, driven by a tough net interest income comparison. But as we've shared
previously, we expect NII will start to become a real tailwind next quarter or in the back half of the year.
Noninterest income grew 3%, while expenses were flat.
Moving to the balance sheet, on slide 5. Average loans declined about 2% sequentially to $109 billion and ended
the quarter at about $107 billion. The decline reflects tepid client demand, a 1% decline in C&I utilization rates,
our disciplined approach as to what we choose to put on our balance sheet, and the intentional runoff of low-
yielding consumer loans as they pay down and mature. As Chris mentioned, we continue to have active dialogue
with clients and prospects and our loan pipelines are building nicely, which gives us the optimism that balances
will stabilize or begin to improve from June 30 levels.
On slide 6, average deposits increased nearly 1% sequentially to $144 billion, reflecting growth across consumer
and commercial deposits. Client deposits were up 5% year-over-year as brokered deposits have come down by
roughly $5.8 billion from year-ago levels. Both total and interest-bearing cost of deposits increased by 8 basis
points during the quarter, a slower rate of increase compared to the first quarter as short-term rates have
remained high. 3 basis points of the increase is due to the intentional addition of roughly $1.6 billion of time
deposits, reflecting a more conservative approach as we prepare for anticipated changes in liquidity rules.
Noninterest-bearing deposits stabilized at 20% of total deposits. And when adjusted for noninterest-bearing
deposits in our hybrid accounts, this percentage remained flat linked-quarter at 24%. Our cumulative interest-
bearing deposit beta was 53% since the Fed began raising interest rates. Our deposit rates remained stable
across the franchise with ongoing testing by product and market. Given higher rates through the year, we have
not seen as much opportunity to reduce deposit rates. However, we have continued to attract client deposits
without having to leave the market on rates, nor have we been paying the cash premiums that many of our
competitors are offering to attract new operating accounts.
Moving to net interest income and the margin on slide 7. Tax-equivalent net interest income was $899 million, up
$13 million from the prior quarter. The benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, mostly from swaps and short-dated
US treasuries, was partly offset by higher funding costs, lower loan balances, and impact from roughly $1.25
billion of forward-starting swaps that became effective this quarter. You will recall that we put these swaps in
place in 2023 at a then prevailing forward rate of 3.4%, as we were managing the roll-offs of the 2024 swaps.
Net interest margin increased by 2 basis points to 2.04%. In addition to the NII drivers just mentioned, the
previously mentioned liquidity build this quarter impacted NIM by about 2 basis points. Cash assets increased by
roughly $3.5 billion sequentially. We continue to believe that our NIM bottomed in the third quarter of 2023 and
that NII bottomed in the first quarter of 2024.
Turning to slide 8. Noninterest income was $627 million, up 3% year-over-year. Compared to the prior year, the
increase was primarily driven by trust and investment services, commercial mortgage servicing fees, and
5

investment banking fees. This offset a 21% decline in Corporate Services income, which has reverted to a more
normalized level at 2022 and the first half of 2023 benefited from elevated LIBOR-SOFR related transition activity.
Commercial mortgage servicing fees rose 22% year-over-year, reflecting growth in servicing and active special
servicing balances. At June 30, we serviced about $680 billion of assets on behalf of third-party clients, including
about $230 billion of special servicing, $7 billion of which was in active special servicing. Trust and investment
service fees grew 10% year-over year, as assets under management grew 7% to $57.6 billion. We saw positive
net new flows in the quarter and, as Chris mentioned, sales production set another record in the quarter. Our
investment banking fees were consistent with our prior guidance for the quarter. Across products, higher M&A
and debt origination activity offset lower syndication and commercial mortgage activity.
On slide 9, second quarter noninterest expenses were $1.08 billion, flat year-over-year and down 4%
sequentially, excluding FDIC special assessment. This quarter, we incurred an additional $5 million FDIC charge
on top of last quarter's $29 million adjustment. On a year-over-year basis, personnel expenses were up due to
Key's higher stock price, offset by lower marketing and business services and professional fees. Sequentially, the
decline was driven by lower incentive compensation and employee benefits from FICO seasonality in the first
quarter.
Moving to slide 10. Credit quality remained solid. Net charge-offs were $91 million, or 34 basis points of average
loans, and delinquencies ticked up only a few basis points. Nonperforming loans increased 8% sequentially and
remained low at 66 basis points of period-end loans at June 30. And as expected, the pace of increase in
criticized loans slowed markedly to 6% in 2Q following our deep dive in the first quarter. We expect that to
continue to moderate and flatten out by the end of the year, assuming no material macro deterioration.
Turning to slide 11. We continue to build our capital position with CET1 up 20 basis points in the second quarter
to 10.5%. Our marked CET1 ratio, which includes unrealized AFS and pension losses, improved to 7.3%, and our
tangible common equity ratio increased to 5.2%. The increases reflect work we've done over the past year to build
capital and reduce our exposure to higher rates. We've reduced our DV01 by 20% over the past 12 months. And
at June 30, our balance sheet was effectively interest rate neutral over a 12-month run. Despite higher rates, our
AOCI improved by about $170 million to negative $5.1 billion at quarter-end, including $4.3 billion related to AFS.
On the right side of the slide, we've extended our AOCI projections through 2026. As we've been doing, we
showed two scenarios, the forward curve as of June 30, which assumes six cuts through 2026, and another
scenario where rates are held at June 30 levels throughout the forecasted time horizon. With the forward curve,
we would expect AOCI to improve by $1.9 billion, or 39% by year-end 2026. If current rates remain in place, we
would still expect $1.7 billion of improvement, given the maturities, cash flow, and time.
Slide 12 provides our outlook for 2024 relative to 2023. Our P&L guidance remains unchanged across all major
line items. We have updated our loan guidance to reflect the lack of demand we referenced. We now expect
average loans to be down 7% to 8% in 2024 and for the year-end 2024 loans to be down 4% to 5% compared to
the end of 2023. This implies fourth quarter loan balances are flat to up $1 billion from June 30 levels. We also
positively revised our average deposit guidance to relatively stable from flat to down 2%, with client deposit
growth in the low-single-digit range. We continue to believe we can hit our full year 2024 and fourth quarter exit
rate net interest income commitments even if loan volumes end up slightly short of our revised target.
On slide 13, we updated the net interest income opportunity from swaps and short-dated treasuries maturing. The
cumulative opportunity stood at about $950 million using the June 30 forward curve, little change from last
quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've realized approximately 50% of this opportunity, which is

shown on the left side in the gray bars. This leaves about $480 million annualized NII opportunity left, which we
expect to capture over the next three quarters with the most meaningful benefits expected to occur in the fourth
quarter and first quarter of 2025.
Moving to slide 14, we've laid out for you the path of how we intend to get from the $899 million of reported net
interest income in the second quarter to a $1 billion-plus number by the end of the year under a couple potential
rate scenarios. In short, we believe we have about $130 million of tailwinds from lower fixed rate assets and
swaps running off and from higher day count. The rest largely nets out and includes what we believe are relatively
conservative assumptions around modest loan growth, deposit costs, funding mix, and near-term negative NII
impact from a Fed rate cut or two.
In the top block, we've laid out the drivers of the growth, assuming the Fed cuts once in December. In this
scenario, we expect about $80 million of benefit from swaps and US treasuries. We also expect growth from
redeployment of lower yielding assets, more specifically, approximately $2 billion of other security cash flows in
the back half of the year and about $1.5 billion of maturing consumer loans. Day count and some pickup in loan
fees drives the other $10 million to $15 million.
In the bottom block, we performed the same exercise, but this time assuming the Fed cuts by 25 basis points in
September and again in December. While we still believe we can comfortably achieve our full-year NII target rate
in this scenario, we do become a little tighter on fourth quarter exit rate, although we still think we'll hit that guide.
Keep in mind, while two rate cuts this year would have a near-term impact on NII as it takes time to deploy
deposit beta, we would expect to recapture that effect in 2025. It would also likely drive improved balance sheet
dynamics as we would see benefit from the approximately $7 billion of forward-starting received fixed swaps that
come off in the first half of 2025, as we position ourselves to be modestly liability sensitive next year. In addition,
rate cuts would most likely provide benefits beyond NII, higher client transition – transaction activity, more
demand for credit, and improvements to capital so we would welcome this trade-off.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
Please go ahead.

Good morning, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, I guess, maybe, Clark, just starting out with NII. It's a huge focus for the stock. Looking at the slide 14, it
seems like the $120 million is locked in no matter what, so fourth quarter NII, [ph] 1 or 2 (00:19:23). And then the
upside from there is driven by how some of the second part of that works out. So, give us a sense of the
downside risk on NII if loan growth ends up being weaker or negative in the back half and implications, I guess,
more so for 2025 versus 2024? Just talk through us in terms of are you giving good color on the Fed rate. I'm just
wondering what weaker loan growth would imply and the scenario where we get to the 2.5% NIM versus 2.4%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Ebrahim. And maybe I'll just kind of reground everybody in the whole thing and then I'll
get to your question, because I'm sure this is not – you're not unique in the NII question for the fourth quarter. So,
first of all, I think we've been really consistent or tried to be that a lot of this pull-through will happen in the second
half of 2024, which we would expect will materialize as you see on the slide and you noted.
So, we've talked a lot about the structural roll-off in swaps and treasuries. So, just a reminder, $5.5 billion of
treasuries maturing in the second half at an average yield of about 47 basis points, $3.8 billion of swaps at about
60 basis points, and then $2 billion of securities repricing at roughly low- to mid-2% yield. So, just that's the piece
on the left that you referred to. There is another $10 million to $15 million in day count and fees. So, again, we
feel fairly good about that pulling through.
We do expect deposit costs to continue to rise, so let's assume one cut coming in December. We guided to a mid-
50s beta if there's no cuts. So, a little bit of drift up if there's one cut in December. That won't be impacted
materially. We will see some benefit on betas if there is a cut in September. But we will also see the impact,
obviously, of loan yields coming down. And that will happen in advance, not just because the loans reprice
immediately, but SOFR will reflect that, as you know, a little bit before that cut. So, there's a little bit of negative
drag in 2024, if there is a first cut in September.
As you commented, right, loan balances will be the variable. So, we've been a little weaker in the quarter than
planned. As Chris said, our pipelines are strengthening materially. I think that's a function of ongoing engagement
with our teams, with clients and prospects. As you said, middle market is up 50%-plus on the pipeline side. So,
8


KeyCorp
(KEY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
we do expect and are starting to see some traction in the back half. I think if there's a little bit lighter loan growth
than what we guided to, we'll still be okay getting there. And if it's materially lower, then that's a different
conversation.
What the real implication is, I think, and probably where your question is going is, what does that mean for 2025
and the size of the balance sheet and the loan book going there? So, look, I do think we all expect rate cuts to
come, although I'm certainly not very good at predicting the economy, so I won't try to do that. But should we get
some rate cuts, we do think that will create more client activity. We're already, as we talked about in pipeline and
engagement dialogues, seeing client interest in that. I think that means, even if we start on a lower exit rate on
loans, we will see good strong growth going into 2025 on loans.
In the 12 years I've been at Key, other than the last 12 months, we've been a leader on commercial loan growth.
And I don't see anything today that would cause me to believe that will be different going forward. But I do think
it's valuable maybe to add a couple pieces of content on 2025 that we really haven't covered. We've been laser-
focused on 2024 swaps and treasuries.
So, let me just add something that we've included in the appendix on slide 20, which just gives you some sense of
maybe some repricing opportunity in 2025 as well, and that is about $20 billion of additional asset repricing that
comes next year. Those yields are low-3%, and that comprised of $5.2 billion of swaps coming off of 1.80%. So,
some more swap pickup, not as meaningful as what we're seeing today, but not unmeaningful at those levels.
Another $11 billion-plus of fixed rate loan repricing that are coming off at 4.15%, and then $4.2 billion of fixed rate
securities that are about 2.75%.
So, definite opportunity there. You'll also get the full year move and impact of the fourth quarter treasuries that will
come off the books and swaps. And then as rate cuts come in, we'll have the full year 2025 to deploy that beta
into our consumer book. So, I do think there are headwinds – or tailwinds for us, sorry, as we get into 2025. And I
think we have confidence we'll be able to grow loans and add clients on the commercial side as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's great color. Thanks, Clark, for walking through. The other question, just on slide 10, you look at NPLs and
criticized picking up sequentially. We are seeing a lot of banks talk more about losses coming from C&I. Remind
us in terms of your outlook on sort of what you are seeing from your customers on C&I? Any specific areas where
you're seeing credit degradation that could lead to just higher NPLs going forward and charge-offs? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, Ebrahim, it's Chris. A couple of things. One, the normal migration from criticized to nonperformers, it's playing
out exactly as we would have expected it to. Stepping back for just a second, our C&I book, 53% of it is
investment grade, 70% is secured. And so, most of our – have very utilization in terms of borrowing. So, we start
from a pretty good place.
Your question is a good one, though, as to where sort of the action is. And let me tell you where we're seeing
some people impacted by the higher-for-longer scenario, consumer goods, some business services, some
equipment businesses. On the other side of the equation, we're starting to see actually healing in the healthcare
sector. So, think about seniors housing, think about facilities-based healthcare, we're seeing that kind of going in
the other direction. The other thing that we always look at is what's the mix of downgrades to upgrades, and
9


KeyCorp
(KEY) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
downgrades still exceed upgrades, but that ratio is starting to close. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
Obviously, C&I is a very broad category, in general, but that's kind of sort of how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. And the only other thing, Ebrahim, I'd just follow on from the financial standpoint, we built the reserve very
strongly over the last 12 months. We came in, I think, solidly in net charge-offs and provision in the quarter. We
do expect some normalization. So, we'd expect net charge-offs to pick up in the back half. That's, I think, fairly
consistent with where we've been. We're comfortable on our 30 basis point to 40 basis point range. I did say last
month, we probably tend to the higher end of that, but that's really a denominator issue on loans versus more
charge-offs than expected.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Clark, appreciate that sort of walk-through on the NII. I
still have sort of an NII-related question. Maybe when you look at sort of the deposits that – so the deposit base
looks like it's going to come in better than you had anticipated previously. Can you maybe walk through what
kinds of deposits you're growing and what – sort of what the spread looks like on those? So, I think there's
probably some question if we dial back the loan growth expectation, but we're still getting funds in that will go into
something, just sort of what that spread looks like in your view?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, good – thanks, Scott, for the question. So, one, I'd say, look, we're always trying to grow operating
accounts and checking accounts. So, we're going to – we'll do that kind of regardless of what we think is
happening on the asset side of the balance sheet. We did mention we added a little bit of CDs intentionally just to
get ahead of what we think are some tightening liquidity expectations. And if we don't see loan growth for
whatever reason, and again, we don't expect that, we do have some funding optimization, whether it's continuing
to drive down the brokered CDs or our FHLB advances. So, we think we'll have some opportunity to do that.
We have built the cash position. So, at the end of the quarter, we were kind of in the $15 billion range. So, that
gives you some indication of where that cash is sitting at the moment. But I would say just on deposits, maybe
highlight a couple of things on where we see the back half going. One, I think, positively, in the commercial book,
we continue to have very active dialogue with clients about their accounts. We've talked a lot about hybrids, for
example. That continues to be a really good product for our clients and for Key. And we've actually moved pretty
meaningfully the percentage of clients that we would deem as sort of index or index-like.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
So, as we have dialogue, as they talk about rates, we've been able to move them to a more index-like product or
structure with obviously anticipation of down rates. So, we think that will benefit us when cuts start to come. And
we're continuing to shorten the CD maturities – rates have stayed higher, so we haven't been as active driving
those prices down. But we have been pulling in the maturities and we do have a decent amount coming due here
in the fourth quarter that we'll be able to reprice to the extent rates do come down. So, that's kind of the long view
on that. And we'd expect – we've been pretty clear conservatively on down betas, if there's one cut. If there's a
second cut, we'll obviously have more opportunity to deploy that in the fourth quarter, but we still think we'll
probably lag a little bit, but that will be a tailwind for 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Thank you, Clark. And then a little bit of a ticky-tack question on the swaps commentary on slide
13. So, you said the $950 million annualized opportunity, which was – that's down a little from $975 million last
quarter. So, I've got a couple of questions. Does that represent a reduction in expectations? Or is that we've just
already absorbed that difference and the $950 million is what's still remaining in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
That should be a function of just where rates are as we do the calculation, but I can – we can follow up and give
you the detail on that. If the forward curves come down a little bit, that would impact that.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on just the loans and the context of the whole balance sheet. So, I'm
just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how much of the loan growth versus what we see in
[ph] HA (00:31:19) when we see your peers, is this you guys just being more conservative? And can you talk a
little bit about like how much did you keep of your originated? Did that change? And where – specifically, when
you mentioned earlier, Clark, the pipelines, like what areas do you see those pipelines coming in? Is it more just a
straight-up commercial? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Ken, it's Chris. Let me start by kind of sharing with you kind of what's going on out there in the marketplace,
because I think loan demand is pretty tepid across the board. And here's what, as we're talking to clients, I think
these are the unknowns that are keeping people from borrowing in general. One is just concern about the
11

economy, what's the trajectory. The next is rates, and it's two things. One, obviously, the cost of capital has gone
up significantly as Fed funds rose from 25 bps to 525 bps. But on top of that, we've just had a lot of volatility in the
tenure. And so, today, it's around 4.2%. I actually think we'll have higher for longer. And I think once that settles
in, people will borrow. But as I talk to clients, if they think that it's going to go down and they think rates are going
to go down and go down precipitously, they're less inclined to make a move.
Also, there's kind of a 12 to 18-month lead time around most big CapEx and property, plant and equipment
projects, and people have kind of been putting those on hold. I think the election, I think that also is just another
variable out there, a lot of these closely held businesses as they think about things like tax policy and the ability to
take accelerated depreciation. So, I think all of those are in the mix.
The next thing that I think also impacts it is there's no question that the rate of inflation is coming down. And so,
people that were first during the pandemic motivated to kind of go long inventory because of the supply issues
and then they were motivated to go long inventory because of inflation, that's kind of wearing off. So, what we
actually saw was a contraction in our utilization rate by 1 percentage point.
Going to your question about kind of what we keep on the balance sheet and what we place, in the quarter just
ended, we raised $23 billion for the benefit of our customers and we kept 16% of it on our balance sheet. And
typically, throughout our history, we typically would have 20%. 16% is up a bit from last quarter. So that kind of
gives you sort of a flavor of what's going on.
I sat down with all of our senior credit officers yesterday and we are seeing in the marketplace some degradation
in terms of structure. And as people compete for the loans that are out there, we clearly are not going to reach for
structure at all. We don't feel like we need to do that, but that is an element, but it's not the lion's share of what's
going on.
On the positive side, we're starting to see transactional finance starting to come into the pipeline. For example, in
our real estate business, 30% of the pipeline right now is transactional, which is a big change. So, maybe that –
hopefully, that's helpful, Ken, in terms of how we're thinking about it and what's going on out in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you for that color. And second question is just, when we think about just the entirety of the balance
sheet, your RWAs have come down a lot over the last year or so. CET1 is growing. CET1 even with AOCI, we
can see in slide 24, up to 7.3%. The stress test went a little bit tougher. So, just how important is managing to that
with AOCI number, if at all, relative to your 10.3% regular way and just how you're thinking about just managing
your capital position vis-à-vis the loan book and RWA growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Ken, we feel good about our capital position. Obviously, since the beginning of – since the initial proposal of Basel
III Endgame, clearly, when the re-proposal comes out, it will be pushed out and it will be less severe. We had said
initially that we had a clear path to get to where we wanted to get to on both a CET1 and a marked CET1, and
that really hasn't changed. The other thing that I've said in the past is, I think as all these rules are applied and
there's a lot of question marks, because we've got the long-term debt proposal, we've got the Basel III Endgame, I
think when you put it altogether, I won't be surprised if most people are where we are right now, where you have
kind of a mid-70s sort of loan-to-deposit ratio. But that remains to be seen, because we'll have to see how it plays
out on a couple of these rules.

Operator: Our next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. My first question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just on slide 14, so it's pretty clear that $899 million plus, let's call it, $125 million, you've got $1.024 billion in
theory "in the bag" for 4Q 2024. And I'm wondering of those green bars, Chris and Clark, in terms of improved
funding mix and loan growth. And we just heard Chris talk about how perhaps the macro environment is not that
great for loan growth. Could you walk us through sort of the probability of those green bars staying green?
Obviously, the last two will have everything to do with the rate curve, right? And you gave us pretty good
guardrails in terms of how to think about deposit costs. But tell us a little bit more about how you plan to achieve
the improved funding mix and the loan growth to be net positive to that number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, let me handle the first one, Erika. So, look, on improved funding mix, we're still sitting on something on
the order of kind of $7 billion of FHLB advances. So, we have some opportunity to continue to bring that down.
We brought brokered down close to $6 billion over the last year, but still some opportunity to manage that as well.
And then, on the margin, we can kind of calibrate where we think overall deposit costs will be based on the size of
the balance sheet and the loan book. So, we do think we have some opportunity to do that and a little bit of
leverage here in the back half of the year on maturities around things like CDs and MMDAs. So, we're looking at
that very dynamically. We're watching our loan pipelines as they materialize and we feel like we should be able to
pivot one way or the other based on how much traction we're getting on loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
And Erika, where we would expect to get loan growth are in areas where we've always been able to get a lot of
loan growth, things like renewables where we're a market leader, and those are project financings where we were
not aggressive last year and now we are, the things like affordable similarly and also sort of the healthcare area
where there's just a lot of consolidation.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is a follow-up to Ken's question about capital. I think what struck me on slide 11
is, I'm not sure how different the forward rate versus flat rate scenario are in terms of [indiscernible] (00:39:12)
declined by that much. But how time versus rates, although granted you only have 25 basis point difference in
terms of the belly of the curve here, is really what's going to heal the AOCI. And obviously, the stress test was a
bit of a negative surprise. As Clark said, you guys have always been a premier grower in commercial. And if
macro comes back, you would think that Key is in a position to outperform peers.
So, to that end, I guess, how much is this adjusted AOCI impacting, if at all, your growth plan? It seems to be
impacting your multiple and how investors think about you. But perhaps sort of square that for your investor base
first in terms of how your RMs are going to market versus the sort of the difference between adjusted and
reported? And Clark, just quick confirmation that should we assume a flat balance sheet from the [ph] 170.6
(00:40:18) through the end of the year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I'll start with the first part of that. Our AOCI position has no impact at all on our RMs outcompeting in the
marketplace. That's just not a variable for them at all. And to your point, under the two different rate scenarios we
talked about, the difference is only $200 million. So, it is a function of time, but it doesn't impact how we run the
business day in and day out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. And I would just add to that, right? We do have consumer loans that continue to come down, and that gives
us both liquidity and capital to redeploy into commercial there. So, to Chris' point, right, that's not something we're
viewing as a limiter in the field. As far as the balance sheet, through the rest of the year, I think relatively flat is a
good place to start. As I said to your – in response to your optimization question, that can move around a little bit,
but I wouldn't expect it to be meaningfully large moves on earning assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, just to confirm, it feels like, obviously, the go-to-market strategy, you're very firm, Chris, that that's not
impacted in terms of managing the balance sheet for these wins. Should we expect any RWA mitigation or credit
risk transfers, or do you feel like that's very much a 2023 story at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. I mean – and I appreciate your consistency on that particular item, Erika. It's – look, it's something we
spend a lot of time looking at and understanding, which I think a lot of us did. We obviously had some peers do
some things, by the way, in places where we had already made moves. So, auto, in particular, where we had
exited back in 2021. There are some opportunities for us to do that. But frankly, we don't see a huge value in
getting that additional CET1 at the moment. If something were to change, we know how to execute a transaction
like that. We have a couple of portfolios that are likely prime candidates for that. But it's not clear to me at this
moment that that's a lever that we need to pull to drive improved capital.

Chris, I know this is not really quantifiable, but, obviously, you've been at this for quite some time. But I took
interest in your comments about your pipelines and how strong they are. Can you give us some confidence on –
there's [ph] pipelines (00:43:19) and there's pipelines. How confident are you that these are real that they could
pull through as you look at it over the next 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Well, we – as you can imagine, we have a pretty detailed review of our pipelines for just the reason that
you mentioned. And I look at pipelines, it's a combination of probability times time, times fee. We spend a lot of
time looking at them. Will some fall away? I'm sure they will. Will some things appear that will be relative short-
dated that will close expeditiously? That will happen as well. But we sweat the details on these pipelines, where
we haven't been as tight as – has been on some of the loan pipelines just because those – they have a few more
variables and people sometimes, they – those deals get done away from you. But with respect to our investment
banking pipelines, we're in good stead. Now, if we have a huge downturn and all of a sudden, the markets change
significantly, obviously, those pipelines can go away. But we feel good about the pipelines.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up on the credit, your slide 10, I think you guys mentioned that there seems to be
some improvement in the healthcare area. And in the C&I, I think you said it may have been durable consumer.
The question on the C&I portfolio, obviously, you guys have been very strong in capital markets for a number of
years. And part of that, I presume, you work with your – the sponsors, the private equity guys, and in earning the
fees from those folks, they tend to also use your balance sheet. Is there any evidence that on the private equity
side or the loans to non-depository financials, that category, and I know it includes insurance companies and less
riskier borrowers, but is there any evidence that there's any credit concerns in that category of loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
No, there's not. And you asked specifically about loans to the private equity community. Obviously, those are in
the category of leveraged loans. And we are literally in this kind of rate increase. We're underwriting those literally
every quarter. Are there some issues? Has there been some migration? Absolutely. But we're not concerned
about that universe of borrowers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
And Gerard, that portfolio that would drive kind of that financials concentration, we've been in that 20-ish years. I
think maybe there's one loss in that timeframe, like literally one credit. It's super clean, great returns, and it is
actually the portfolio that we entered into that forward flow agreement with Blackstone and that was entirely to
manage the credit risk concentration, not for any concerns about the quality of that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. And Clark, while I have you, just a quick technical question on that slide 20 where you gave us the 2025
refinancing dollar amounts and the coupon on the – what you're receiving. What's the increase, for example, the
1.80% on the weighted average rate received, if that was to convert today, what would it convert to? Same thing
with the fixed rate loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, today, we are putting forward starters on in 2025 for the purpose of getting a little bit liability sensitive
going forward, and we're putting those on kind of in the 4% range. So, obviously, that depends on how forward
starting and how long they are. But that compares to the 1.80% quite favorably, obviously, and even the 2.78%
that sits out there in 2026. So, definite benefit there.
On the fixed rate consumer loans at 4.15%, those are probably – well, one, the student loan market just isn't there
for a variety of reasons, rates and sort of...

...overhang and the forgiveness in the holiday from the government. But if you were going to put on kind of the
jumbo mortgage market, that's probably in the 6.5% to 7% range, but that isn't incredibly vibrant at the moment
either. But those would be the kind of comparison points.
And then, on your – yeah, if you did C&I, you'd be at 7%, so that would be the way we'd probably think about that
replacement rate. And then, on the securities, that 2.74% today is coming on kind of 5.5% to 5.75-ish range.

John Pancari Q

As you're looking at the impact of the swap and treasury maturities and the benefit to NII, heavy focus on the 4Q
exit rate of the NIM and what it means. And clearly, that is a pretty positive impact on 2025. And I believe from a
revenue perspective, you could be looking at double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens or so on NII next year in
terms of growth, just given that dynamic. What type of – how should we think about how much of that benefit
really fall to the bottom line? Operating leverage for next year looks like it could be anywhere in the ballpark of
800 basis points to 900 basis points positive operating leverage based on how consensus is thinking about it if
you're looking at a 2% expense growth rate. So, is it that wide of positive operating leverage that you're allowed to
materialize and allow this fall to the bottom line, or you think that we could be looking at something less than that?

John Pancari Q

Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately, on the deposit costs side, I know you indicated that you expect
some incremental pressure on deposit costs and they increased this quarter, but a little bit less than first quarter,
and you cited the CDs actions on that front. Could you maybe just help us think about the incremental upside that
you think is likely under maybe a forward curve assumption when you look at deposit costs from here?

Clark H. I. Khayat A

When you say upside, just so I understand, you're talking about increase in rates or beta?

Increase in rates. Yeah. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look, so we guided to kind of mid-50s if there were no cuts. One cut will have a maybe minor
impact on that, if that cut is in December. As you know, there's just not a lot of time to implement that. And the
reality is, I guess, technically, if that cut occurs, the beta cycle is sort of over. So, the question is, is your beta on
that first cut positive or negative? I think it would be – in December, again, not a lot of impact. If we do get a cut in
September as well, as I said, I think you're going to have a little bit of drift just by nature of stickiness of the
consumer book. But we think we'd have kind of a plus or minus 20% beta coming down. What that does on the
overall cost, again, you get kind of into the technical definition of beta cycles ending, but I think you'd see in
September cut, rates start to really flatten through the back half of the year, whereas with one cut in December,
they may still be up a bit.

Just to bring it altogether on the investment banking fees, the strong kind of pipelines, how are you feeling about

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well, first of all, thank you for the question. The three things that really drive that are, as you point out, loan
growth, your view of the macro economy, and then idiosyncratic to the actual credits. I could see a scenario
depending on how this plays out where we evaluate what the total reserve is. But I think it's premature right now
only because it's still unclear to us exactly what path the economy is going to take. But as we get more clarity,
we'll continue to evaluate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, I guess, what you're saying is until there's uncertainty, probably keep the reserves at these levels and then
when you get a little bit more certainty, you can start to bring that down and rightsize that relative to your loan
growth. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Right. We've constantly been looking at it and adjusting it based on the three metrics that I just shared with you.

an overall health of the business, I'd take the second cut, because I think it drives more loan demand. I think it
buys more capital markets activity. I think it gets people more engaged in economic investment. So, I think it's a
trade we certainly would make going into 2025 versus, I guess, maximizing what's in the fourth quarter.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And for my follow-up question, I want to go back and ask John's question a little bit different
on expenses. I know you're not going to give 2025 outlook at this point. But if you do achieve the expense outlook
this year, I think it's basically three years in a row where you haven't had any real expense growth. And I guess
what we're curious of, there's lots of ways to achieve that. One of them is just deferring expenses and projects
until the environment's better. And is that the key? Just help us understand that. Is there a catch-up in expenses
coming, because you've been deferring and you have an expense growth for multiple years? Or could the next
year, as the revenue environment gets better, just look like a more normal expense year for the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, Steve, the answer is, as we look forward, it will be a more normal expense year for the company as we
continue to come out of the position that we're in. We have been investing, though, and the reason we've been
able to invest is we took $400 million of expenses out last year just for the purpose of being able to invest in
people and in technology and in the businesses that we're trying to grow like our private client business, our
payments business, our investment banking business.
So, expenses will go up in 2025 as you see the pull-through of the earnings that we're talking about. But we have
not starved the business. We've continued to invest in our migration to the cloud. We've continued to spend $800
million a year in our tech area. But in order to be able to continue to invest in the business, I think you can
imagine that expenses will go up in 2025. But it's not because of deferred expenses, it's just because our
business continues to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Just to reiterate Chris' point there, investment will be stable to up. It's just the lack of a clear takeout to fund
that, that will be the difference.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. Okay. That's great color. Thanks a lot.

Operator: Next we go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I think I'm missing something very basic, and that is that you have the same – no change to the fixed asset
repricing. You have less favorable loan growth guidance, yet you still have the same NII guidance. So, what am I
missing in my logic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Look, I mean, part of it is there is a range, Mike, so where you land in the range is part of that. As we've
talked about on the call, a lot of the increase is going to be structural to the fixed asset repricing. So the plus or
minus pieces on that, I think, is largely going to be whether or not we have loan growth. But a little bit of that
muted loan growth is offset by a little bit stronger deposit performance. So, we hit both of those balance sheet
components, one to the negative, one to the positive, and we think those are somewhat offsetting. So, the amount
of loan growth we see in the second half would be kind of the plus or minus on that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
You said middle market pipelines are up 50% quarter-over-quarter. Is that correct? And how much is middle
market of your total commercial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
The answer is the 50% quarter-over-quarter is correct, and middle market would be of total commercial, probably
40%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, even though you have such strong backlogs and it seems like you have a certain degree of conviction, you
still thought you should guide loan growth lower. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
We did. And one of the reasons we felt that way, Mike, is that our exit rate was lower than our average loan rate,
which was part of our thinking there.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
And then just a separate topic, Chris. In terms of the merger environment, I feel like the topic died down here
recently. But you said that you'd be willing and able to pursue another First Niagara sort of deal. Is that still the
case, and under what circumstances do you think it would become more likely? Would it be more likely after the
election? What do you think the tone is in D.C., and what's your appetite?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, as it relates to depository, I don't see anything happening in the near future. I think the obstacles to
completing a deal is, first of all, can you get it approved? Secondly, if you can get it approved, how long does it
take and what's left of the business after you get it approved? As I mentioned earlier, I think there's some real
questions on everyone seems to be coalescing around a soft landing. I hope people are right. I'm not sure that
that's a fait accompli. And so, I think as you're thinking about buying a business, you're buying their book and, of
course, unrealized losses become realized losses. So, for all those reasons, I don't see it happening in the near
future.
What I had mentioned on the call that [ph] you had (01:01:47) sponsored is I said, with respect to First Niagara,
we were able to keep the clients and keep the people and take 42% of the costs out of the business. And I think
that's a pretty good business model in any industry. So, I think that – I think there will be consolidation. What I've
shared with our team is I don't think there's going to be any consolidation until there's a lot. So, I think there will be
consolidation. Where you will see us spending time is on these entrepreneurial businesses. I'm really proud of our
ability to buy entrepreneurial niche businesses and integrate them into our business. That's really hard for a big
company to do, and I think we've done it pretty well. And that would be things that we'd be focused on in the near
and medium term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last question, investment banking, I know your mix is different. You're more loan syndications. You have
mergers. But relative to the big banks, I know it's not apples-to-apples completely, but it just doesn't really
compare so favorably to them. On the other hand, you said you have record backlogs in investment banking. So,
what areas of investment banking are you seeing the record backlogs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, the divergence – I'll start with the divergence. We are focused on certain industries. I think a lot of
people had a pretty good quarter with respect to equities. We did not particularly just because, one – it's not a
huge business for us, and secondly, equities team tend to be issued in certain verticals at certain times. Where
we have a strong backlog, and it's the most important place for us, given our middle market franchise, Mike, is in
M&A, because our M&A business pulls through a lot of things like loans, like hedging. So, that's where our
pipelines are strong.
The other area, we have a commercial mortgage business. And as rates come down, I think you're going to see
that business – as rates come down and stabilize, and I think you need both candidly for all the reasons I talked
about earlier, I think you're going to see that really pick up in terms of what comes out of the pipe in the second
half of the year.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.

Good morning, Peter
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. The consumer loan growth was under quite a bit of pressure in the second quarter. I'm just
wondering if you could talk about the outlook on the consumer side of the lending business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. One, our consumer lending, we – as you know, Peter, we don't have a huge credit card book. It's really
mortgage, home equity, personal loan, student loans, not an enormous amount of volume in the mortgage
market, the jumbo mortgage market or nonconforming market or the student loan market, which is generally what
has been on balance sheet for us. We continue to score clients where we can, particularly in held-for-sale
mortgages. But I would suspect, as we go forward, you will see us do – and rates come down and those
businesses get a little stronger. You'll see us support those clients very actively, but probably do a little bit more of
that off-balance sheet. So, it will – we'll be that a little bit more as the fee income generators as we service those
clients. We will always have some room on the balance sheet to accommodate good clients as it relates to
nonconforming structures as an example. But that will be probably less so than it's been in the last few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Would you expect, just given the low yields, a similar type of decline going forward on consumer side?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Well, just relative to the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. I mean, I'd have to go back and look, for sure. But you have, yeah, student loans and mortgages, right?
They just have structural paydowns every month. So, we'll see that book continue to come down at a sort of
normalized rate. I think it will accelerate as rates come down, but they have to come down quite a bit, frankly, for
a lot of refi. So, I think what you're seeing is probably illustrative of what you'd expect going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, definitely, I don't know of any unique thing that happened in the second quarter that would have driven
consumer growth down more than expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then just on a different question, just on buybacks, I know there are no plans to buy back stock this
year. But Chris, I'm just wondering, what are some of the parameters you're looking at to get back into the market
to buy back stock?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, the first parameter would be to really have a firm understanding of where Basel – the Basel III Endgame is
going to be, because until we know what the phase-in period is and what capital is going to be required, it's –
that's just – I think that's very important piece of the equation. And for us, obviously, we had mentioned we've
been under-earning. And as our balance sheet yields, that will give us an opportunity at the appropriate time to
revisit that. But we've been very clear, we're not going to engage in any buybacks this year, for sure, because we,
in fact, don't even have a plan approved by the board. But going forward, obviously, like everybody, we'll be
taking a look at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
And then just one last, just clarification question, Clark, on Steve's question about the NII range. You mentioned,
with two rate cuts, closer to the bottom end of the range. Does that mean closer to 2% down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Closer to 5%. So, it would be the [ph] towards that end of the range (01:08:12). Yeah.
