Eric Wasserstrom
Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of the earnings
presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that
appear in our first quarter earnings press release and presentation.
Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session. During the
Q&A session, you'll be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After a follow-up
question, please return to the queue.
And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In my comments this morning, I'm going to
address three topics: our strategic and financial highlights for the first quarter; the expected impact of the current
environment on our 2022 results; and some of the exciting advancements we've made around our DE&I and ESG
reporting.
Starting on slide 3. We had another quarter of outstanding results with earnings of $1.2 billion after tax or $4.22
per share. Our earnings this quarter were the result of consistent execution on our business priorities against the
backdrop of complex economic and geopolitical conditions.
Consistent with our expectations, our loan growth accelerated to 8% from the prior year as we benefited from
continued strong sales and investments in new account acquisition last year and into 2022.
Year-over-year card sales were up 23% with improvement in all categories. There's been a lot of discussion about
the impact of energy price inflation on consumer spending. We believe that higher prices at the pump were a
relatively small contributor to sales volume, adding approximately 200 basis points to our first quarter volume
growth.

We also continue to lean into account acquisition and new accounts grew 11% year-over-year with particular
strength in the Prime Cashback segment, reflecting our attractive value proposition. Credit performance remains
strong with credit losses normalizing in line with our expectations.
This is an outgrowth of our consistent focus on prime lending and our strong credit management throughout the
pandemic, along with robust labor market conditions. Importantly, we have not seen evidence of credit stress
beyond the moderate pace of normalization that we anticipated coming into the year. In fact, as John will address
later, we're narrowing our expectations for credit losses to the low end of our prior range.
We continue to effectively manage expenses while making investments for profitable growth, analytic capabilities
and product enhancements. As our account growth demonstrates, we're making significant investments in card
growth. But we're also focused on innovation in our non-card offerings to further enhance our full suite of digital
banking and lending products.
In early April, we launched our Cashback Debit product. This product is digitally native including a mobile-first
customer experience. It provides features like early access to paychecks as well as items that others will struggle
to match, including no fees, 1% cashback on debit transactions and our industry-leading service. We plan on
investing more for growth of this product with broad market advertising later this year.
Now let me talk about how we expect the current environment to impact Discover. We provide some views on
macro conditions on slide 4. The most pressing issue is Russia's invasion of the Ukraine. Naturally, our primary
concern is for the resulting humanitarian crisis and the well-being of the Ukrainian people as well as for our
employees and customers with close ties to this nation.
From the more narrow perspective of our business, we currently have no activities in either country, and we do
not anticipate any material impacts on our business from the war. We have indefinitely suspended our efforts to
open an office in Russia. And while we have temporarily paused our certification of a Diners Club bank issuing
partner in Ukraine, we plan on moving forward as soon as we can.
The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia have also raised concerns about the risk of
recession globally and domestically. We do not see any evidence of this across our consumer lending portfolio.
Our credit metrics remain good, and there is nothing we're seeing in terms of consumer spending or borrowing
behavior that suggests that a broader downturn is imminent.
Another concern has been the significant elevation and flattening of the yield curve given the anticipation by the
rates market around aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve to stem high inflation. Because we are
modestly asset sensitive, the potential for a greater number of Fed rate hikes has improved our outlook for spread
income, which John will discuss momentarily.
And while we're not immune from the effects of inflation, our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge as
the pressure that inflation may create on elements of our expense structure are partially offset by the contribution
inflation makes to our sales volume.
In summary, while macro conditions are much more fluid than we had thought coming into this year, we're
positioned to benefit from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin and slowly
normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over our forecast horizon.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Finally, I want to point out our new ESG-related disclosures. In March, we produced our first diversity, equity and
inclusion transparency report which highlights our commitment to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects our
communities and customers.
We also recently published our first ESG summary that includes details on our greenhouse gas emissions among
other items. The data in our new reports is encouraging, but we intend to do more to reduce our impact on the
environment and to advance diversity and equity in our organization and communities.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our
expectations for the rest of 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution on
our business priorities with accelerating loan growth and solid credit performance. I'll begin with our financial
summary results on slide 5. There are a few things I'd like to call out here.
The first is that our net income is lower year-over-year because of our reserving actions. In the first quarter of last
year, we had an $879 million reserve release, while this quarter included a $175 million release. Adjusting for
reserve changes, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 19% year-over-year.
Second, our reported total revenue net of interest expense increased $107 million or 4% from the prior year.
However, this included $162 million net loss in equity investments. Excluding this loss, total revenue increased
10%. These points underscore the strength of our core earnings power even in a fluid economic environment.
Let's turn to the details of the quarter. Looking at slide 6, net interest income was up $149 million or 6%, driven by
improved net interest margin and higher average receivables. NIM was 10.85%, up 10 basis points from the prior
year and 4 basis points from the prior quarter.
The year-over-year increase in net interest margin reflects lower funding costs and a favorable shift in funding
mix, partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. We made further progress on our funding mix
with consumer deposits now making up 71% of total funding.
On a sequential basis, the modest increase in NIM was driven by a slightly improved revolve rate on credit card
loans, partially offset by increased funding costs. The better revolve rate reflected a 70 basis point decline in the
payment rate quarter-over-quarter. This helped boost sequential loan yields by 5 basis points.
However, the payment rate remains nearly 500 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect
that the normalization in the payment rate will continue through the back half of 2023.
Receivables were higher driven by card, which increased 10% year-over-year from the continued strong sales
and robust new account growth last year and into this year. Organic student loans increased 4%, reflecting solid
originations through the 2021 peak season. Personal loans were down 1% due to a sustained high payment rate.
Looking at other revenue on slide 7, excluding the $162 million loss in equity investments, non-interest income
increased $120 million or 26%. This was driven by net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $79
million or 33%, reflecting strong sales. Sales were up 23% year-over-year, with growth across all categories.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Inflation drove a modest portion of the growth in the quarter, and we expect that inflation will remain a benefit to
sales growth over the short term. Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year.
However, the rewards rate was down 2 basis points year-over-year. We still anticipate the full year rewards rate to
increase 2 to 4 basis points. Loan fee income was up $33 million or 31%, primarily driven by an increase in late
fee instances.
Moving to expenses on slide 8, total operating expenses were up $49 million or 5% year-over-year. Excluding
marketing investments, expenses increased just 1%. Compensation expense was slightly down year-over-year on
lower bonus accruals and head count, which was partially offset by higher average salaries. We expect some
degree of salary and wage pressure in 2022 and possibly into 2023 as we take steps to remain competitive.
Marketing expense increased $38 million or 25%. We continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer
banking products, including support of our relaunched Cashback Debit product. Information processing increased
$16 million or 15% year-over-year versus a low level in the period a year ago. This expense was flat sequentially.
Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in analytics to support growth, innovation and generate
operating efficiencies.
Moving to slide 9. Net charge-offs remained low and were in line with our expectation for modest credit
normalization. Total net charge-offs were 1.61%, 87 basis points lower than the prior year, and up 24 basis points
from last quarter's record low. Total net charge-off dollars were down $169 million from the prior year and up $55
million sequentially.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. This quarter, we released $175 million from reserves and
our reserve rate continued to decline, dropping 17 basis points to 7.1%. The reserve release primarily reflects the
sustained strong credit performance in our portfolio, partially offset by loan growth.
Looking at the macroeconomic environment, the pandemic now has a lesser impact on our outlook. The primary
sources of risk have shifted to the impacts of inflation and a potential slowdown from Fed actions. While the risk
has shifted, the economic view of the US consumer remains healthy.
Looking at slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 14.7%, slightly lower than the prior period and
still well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $944 million of common stock during the quarter, executing on
our remaining authorization. Our board of directors also approved a new $4.2 billion shares repurchase program
that expires on June 30, 2023, and increased our common stock dividend by 20% to $0.60 per share. This
repurchase authorization represents our largest ever over a five-quarter horizon. It is evidence of our commitment
to returning excess capital to shareholders while sustaining our investments in strong organic growth.
Concluding on slide 12. Our outlook for 2022 remains favorable, and we are improving some elements of our
expectations. Starting with loans, spending trends through the first quarter and a modest decline in the payment
rates improved our conviction for high single-digit growth. We are revising our view on NIM. We now see 5 to 15
basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter.
This view includes five Fed rate hikes at 25 basis points each. Our prior view reflected two rate hikes of the same
magnitude. If the Fed increases rates beyond this, it would provide modest upside to net interest margin.
Despite inflationary pressures, there's no change to our guidance for operating expense. Marketing is expected to
be above 2019 levels with non-marketing expenses up low single-digits.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
We are improving our credit outlook. We expect losses to be between 2.2% and 2.4% for the full year. While
there's still some uncertainty about the back half of this year, our current credit performance and delinquency
trends give us confidence in a tighter range. And as previously mentioned, our board recently approved a new
share repurchase program and increased our dividend.
In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisitions last year
and into 2022. Credit performance reflected our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management with
moderate normalization as expected.
We manage operating expenses, while investing in new product, features and functionalities. And our highly
capital-generative model enable us to increase our dividend and share repurchase authorization, while supporting
strong organic asset growth.
These results demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility of our integrated digital banking and payments model, and
I'm confident that we are well-positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.

Competitive intensity and elevated expense pressures are leading your peers to report negative operating
leverage, but you just reported over 500 basis points of positive operating leverage and your results certainly
stand out. That degree of positive operating leverage was much stronger than I think anyone was expecting. Can
you frame for us whether an efficiency ratio here in the 37% range is sustainable?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Hey, Bill, thanks for the question. So certainly, we were pleased with the execution in the quarter. And in terms of
the specifics around efficiency ratio, what we've guided to in the past, and we're still holding there is that over the
medium-term, we would expect an efficiency ratio in the upper 30s.
Now this quarter certainly demonstrated some progress on that front. There is a bit of timing there. We kept our
marketing guidance, as we indicated before, which would bring that above 2019 levels. So there's a slight
skewing towards the back half of the year.
We continue to invest for growth. There will be some upper funnel or broad market advertising as well. So we're
watching every dollar and making sure we get an appropriate return for our shareholders as we invest it whether
from an expense standpoint or from a loan lending standpoint. So I don't want to get over our skis here on that
efficiency ratio, strong execution, and we're going to continue to kind of work towards the medium-term target.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's helpful. If I may follow up on capital from the 14.7% CET1 level that you're at today, would you
expect capital consumed through loan growth and the $4.2 billion authorization that you announced to be enough
to get you down to that 10.5% target over the next five quarters? Or would you still expect to be sort of running
above 10.5% at that point? And how much flexibility do you see in that $4.25 billion, is there some chance we
could see you take that higher depending on how things play out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So in terms of the CET1 ratio, we're sticking to the 10.5% target. There is about 175 basis points from CECL
transition still yet to impact that CET1 ratio. So then that still puts us over 200 basis points above the target I just
expressed. So our thinking is that over the next two, three, perhaps four years depending on investments and the
broad economy to close down to the 10.5% target. But in terms of the repurchase authorization, our board just
approved it. So it'd be way premature to talk about any changes to that.

Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. So in terms of leaning into growth, I would say we're pleased with our growth but it remains
balanced. In terms of the investments we're making, I expect our prime cost per account to be down from last
year. So we're not in any way overinvesting.
By and large, our credit policies are back to where they were pre-pandemic. But as we said at that time, it was
late cycle. So we're not exactly letting credit go. So we're still executing on a model of a disciplined growth even
as the economic environment, especially the US consumer remains strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And I guess maybe just following up on interest rate sensitivity. John, could you just talk about what you're seeing
– any – I know you raised the NIM expectations, but any changes in sort of industry behavior around chasing
rates from competitor banks and such? Maybe could you just talk about deposit beta? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So in terms of competitor behavior. So we have seen the competitor set that we benchmark
ourselves against recently through this quarter, this past quarter increased rates and into this quarter.
We – as you observed our behavior in the pandemic, we moved fairly aggressively down. As a matter of fact, we
led our competitive set on the interest rate movements downward. Now that we're in a rising rate environment, my
expectation is we're going to be disciplined around that.
So the principles are that we want to ensure we have a fair customer proposition. We also seek to kind of manage
our interest costs as effectively as we can. So a combination of funding needs and competitive dynamics will
dictate how we – how and when we take deposit pricing actions.

Great. Thanks. I guess I was hoping for – Roger, if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment?
And obviously, there's been a lot going on from some of your competitors.
You talked about an 11% kind of growth in new accounts and your marketing expense was pretty much under
control. So can you just talk about what it is that allows you to kind of do that and be comfortable in terms of your
account growth going forward?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Sure. Thanks, Moshe. I think it really comes down to having a balanced and distinctive value proposition. The
Discover brand is one of the most trusted brands in financial services. We provide a leading customer experience,
both through the phone and digitally, which helps with retention as well as booking new accounts.
We spent a long time building our skills around managing cash rewards, not just paying the higher rate but
focused on every part of the process. And then continuing to innovate with new features and functionality, and
you saw we just launched another one around helping protect your information from people reselling it on the
web.
And so that, I think, allows us to succeed in just about any environment. I view the card business as always
competitive. Occasionally, there's a lull in the depths of a recession. But beyond that, it's our job to execute for our
owners and grow, and you're seeing that this quarter. And I'm confident we'll be able to keep it going.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up in a completely different direction and that is you talked about the Debit
product. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much in resources you're putting behind that, how big it could
be? And are there any other areas in which you can kind of leverage the network in the coming year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So the network does give us advantages for both our credit card issuing business, but also in terms of being
able to support the 1% cash back on debit purchases, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace and builds
on the Discover heritage with cashback in a new direction.
So we'll work our way into it. As John mentioned, we'll start broad market advertising for that product later this
year. But we intend to sort of scale it gradually and build for the long-term. Over time, we expect it to be a key part
of our business.
And then, we see advantages on our core card issuing business. Good example is our ability, as we roll out, SRC
to pre-enroll our customers in a way that will be much more challenging for issuers on a third-party network. And
finally, we remain focused on the payment services business, monetizing our network investments through
attracting third-party volume.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Nice growth in the quarter and a really nice pickup, especially as we moved into end of period here. And I just
wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about funding that continued strong growth as we move through
the year given that you've got the Fed shrinking the balance sheet and probably some deposits growth slowdown.
I looked at the liquidity balances; it looks like they're down to pre-pandemic lows, which – well, during the
pandemic, I should say. So I'm just thinking through deposit growth versus liquidity utilization versus wholesale
funding, how should we think about how you're planning on funding the loan growth? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Great. Thanks, Betsy. So in terms of loan growth, we're going to take a balanced approach. So we talked
about the target of 70% to 80% of our funding needs coming from OSA or deposits from our customer base.
There's always the opportunity to go into the market and execute on broker CDs if liquidity needs dictate that.
We also issued an ABS transaction this past quarter in a rising rate environment at pretty compelling rates overall.
So we're going to take that balanced approach. And you will see or we did – if you haven't seen it, you'll see a
little bit more of it. There'll be a little bit more broad market marketing on deposits and then also targeted
marketing on deposits, and we're going to try to balance kind of the rate and the marketing in order to get the
most effective cost of funds as we can. So that's essentially the strategy in a nutshell. So we actually just went
through a review from the Fed on our liquidity controls, and it's come out very, very strong. So we're pleased with
the position of the business and the processes around it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, you indicated, I think earlier, John, that the outlook that you have for
NIM includes five rate hikes from the Fed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And maybe you could help us understand as we go to that six, seven, eight, nine rate hike that's expected, how
does your asset sensitivity change, if at all? Or should we just take what's in the 10-Q and apply that to whatever
comes after Fed rate hike five?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So the math on it would be for a 25 basis point increase somewhere between 3 bps and 5 bps to NIM on an
annual basis. Now there's a bunch of other dynamics that obviously impact that, right? So you touched upon it
earlier. So deposit pricing could impact that as well as the revolve rate, payment rate and then the credit impacts
coming through net interest margin.
So, there's a lot of dynamics there, and that was why we are conservative in terms of the number of hikes that we
baked into this updated guidance. If there are more hikes and we're able to kind of effectively manage our
liquidity, credit remains as we expect, we would certainly see some upside from that guidance we provided.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. So thanks, John. So I don't really kind of think about this in terms of a deposit beta. What I do here is think
about it in terms of broad principles. So the principles are that we're going to have an attractive proposition for our
customers, and that we're going to manage interest costs as low as we can, while still maintaining that proposition
I just talked about.
So I gave the point in terms of our actions during the pandemic when we had plenty of liquidity, that we were a
price leader down. And what I said in this rising rate environment, we expect that we're going to manage that
interest cost very, very tightly in order to hopefully drive overall cost low, increase NIM and benefit shareholders.
So I don't want to kind of tag to a specific beta because they tend to be – the numbers tend to be kind of off a
month from now, so.

Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then separately, just regarding the broader economic backdrop, given the
Fed's efforts here to tame inflation and slow the economy and then looks like this morning, we're getting a
probably a disappointing print here on GDP. I'm curious, does your 2022 outlook factor in a slowdown in card
spend at all?

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
It does. So actually, it was – the 23% for the quarter was higher than we anticipated. We're frankly happy to see
that. But there is a modest stepping down through this year. Effectively, it's hard to envision year-over-year kind of
sales growth to continue in the upper-20s.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
John, maybe to follow up on a couple of the questions that have been asked. I think the focus has been on the
liability side of the balance sheet as it pertains to rate sensitivity, but maybe we could talk a little bit about the
asset side.
And I'm just curious obviously a lot has changed over the last few years. So maybe can you unpack a little bit for
us have we seen significant changes in terms of floating rates relative to the last time rates rose?
How much more improvement do you think we could see in revolve rates? And I guess lastly, are we now back to
more sustainable BT level such that we can see the asset yields improving with benchmark rates? Thanks. And I
have a follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So there's a lot there. So revolve rate actually increased mildly in the quarter as the
payment rate decreased by the 70 basis points that I spoke about. And by the way, that payment rate decline was
essentially in line with how we built our original guidance.
So, as we think about inflation or other impacts that could drive payment rate lower, we've essentially de-risked
our guidance for loan growth. So we could see additional upside subject to payment rate and a bunch of other
factors.
The other pieces there in terms of kind of overall asset growth. What I would do is I would break it down into kind
of the three categories, our primary products. So card, you saw the double-digit growth there. Student loans at
4%, so we'll have another peak origination season coming in 2022. We hope to be able to execute there and
continue to take market share.
And personal loans the growth was down 1%, but originations were up strong double digits. So we had a high
payment rate impacting personal loans that we expect to moderate over time, giving some level of loan growth in
that product.
So I guess your question had a number of elements. Hopefully, I gave you enough detail to be able to piece
together the information you're trying to glean.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. And maybe as a follow-up on credit, it was good to see you lowering the high-end of the range. And I
understand you probably have about six months of visibility, so the fourth quarter is probably still hard to predict.
But just looking at some of the credit metrics, delinquencies remain really, really benign, they're only up 20 basis
points on the bottom. So can you maybe just talk about what's included now in the credit expectations? And do
we have the potential to see credit come in towards the bottom end of the range over the course of the year?
Thanks.

Yeah. So, when we gave this initial guidance, we gave a pretty broad range, and we batted around internally
whether or not we should tighten it. And as the quarter unfolded, our conviction around that tighter range and
perhaps the lower end grew.
So as you said, there's three months. The fourth quarter, we don't have perfect visibility in terms of kind of roll rate
performance. But our modeling analytics have been actually surprisingly accurate and we have a high expectation
there. So we'll see how the rest of this quarter plays out. And hopefully, we can give updated guidance in a
subsequent call.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. So your reserve rate is still about 100 points above CECL day one. Can you just talk about what
assumptions are embedded in that? How we should think about that ratio if a recession happens in the near-term
as some are expecting? I mean it would seem these levels that's, almost already in the reserve. And alternatively,
where could it go if some of this macro uncertainty clears?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Right. Thanks, Mark. So yes, the reserve rate came in at 7.1%, CECL day one was 6.1%. So some context
around CECL day one. So it was an accounting adjustment reflecting new guidance provided by the FASB, right?
So we did our best to capture life of loan estimates of what losses would be and embed them in our overall
reserve rate. Now the macro environment at the time versus today has certainly changed. Portfolio dynamics
have changed. As a matter of fact, our – the upper end of our kind of credit quality for the balance sheet is
stronger than it was CECL day one. But there's still a degree of uncertainty that we are managing through. So as
we said in prior quarters, we're conservative on this.
We want to make sure that we're appropriately capturing reserve rates under GAAP. If the broad macros are
positive and the portfolio performance is positive, we could continue to step down through a combination of
growth or reserve releases. And if the recession likelihood continues to increase, the broad macros could warrant
either holding or perhaps even increasing. But overall, I think the takeaway here should be, Mark, that the
portfolio performance is really, really strong. There's no view of any damage to the consumer. There's no view
that job losses are going to increase in the – definitely through this year and likely through the first half of next
year. So all those factors are positive from a credit and reserving standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then just a clarifying question on the OpEx guidance. You indicated no change there despite
what seemed like kind of growing wage inflation pressures that you've indicated you're not immune to. Should we
assume that as that pressure kind of builds in the second half, that what happens as you flex down kind of other
non-marketing non-wage expense to maintain some kind of a targeted operating leverage?

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So here's how we think about it. So – and I've tried to articulate this over the past 2.5 years. We're going to
be really disciplined in terms of how we spend our dollars. And Discover has got a long history of that. We've
done some stuff to kind of drive both accountability and visibility of the expense base, which my sense is, it has
helped. It's important to note that as we see opportunities, we're going to continue to invest. We also are – as you
paraphrased, we're seeing inflation coming in on salary and wages. We're also seeing it in third-party spend. So
we will have effectively managed that in order to be able to deliver to the guidance we provided. And if we see
incremental opportunity either for growth or otherwise, we'll invest to – and we'll create transparency on that in
order to drive long-term shareholder returns.

Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. When you consider this rate environment versus the last rate cycle, do you feel that the deposit betas
that are going to play out in this cycle are going to mirror what we saw in the last cycle? Or – and is that your base
case, when you think about funding costs despite what might be a much more aggressive Fed this time around?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Last time, I would take out as a proxy, but there's couple of things that are different, right? So the pace of
inflation is a heck of a lot higher here, right? We're at record levels of inflation. The other thing that is different is
the savings rate coming into this inflationary cycle, much higher. So those two dynamics could create some
offsetting impacts. But it will be subject to kind of liquidity and loan growth across the industry and who's got a
competitive proposition. And we're very comfortable with our proposition in terms of the customer experience, the
kind of the rate. And if you take a look at our rate versus a brick-and-mortar bank, I find it ironic that anybody
keeps any excess cash in those institutions whatsoever. So we're going to be diligent on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then you mentioned that you're very disciplined on how you spend your dollars. You're pretty
consistent on that commentary. Are you seeing anywhere where some of your competition may be a little
exuberant in how they're spending in dollars just given the opportunity set in the market today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yes. I would say, in general, in this business, you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in
marketing. And so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the
returns they got and maybe less happy with that. So we feel good about both what we're investing on the rewards
side and the guidance we provide there of only 2 to 4 basis point increase, but also that we'll see cost per

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes, good morning. I know home equity is a small part of your business, but I didn't know if there was maybe a
growing opportunity as a lot of the sort of cash out refi activity could potentially slow. And then secondly, I think
you have a partnership on account-to-account payments. I was just curious if you think that will take off at the
point of sale in the United States?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So in terms of our home equity business, we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive.
Perversely, many households, their greatest asset could be their 3% mortgage. So while we're excited about it, it
also isn't that huge. On the payment side, we're excited about our partnership, but I don't see tremendous
disruption coming to point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon. But we're excited to
work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks everybody for taking my question this morning. Can you talk a little bit behaviorally about the stratification
you're seeing in terms of borrower behavior, both in terms of credit performance and also in terms of spending
behavior, discretionary versus nondiscretionary shifts across the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. Seeing strength across all categories, revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactor sales
growth, but that reflects our lend-focused model. But – and that sales strength is continuing into April, where
through, say, the 24th sales are still up 23% year-over-year.
So consumer is good and breadth across all categories. In terms of different segments, from a credit standpoint,
you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments. But again, we're very pleased, and John
mentioned that in his comments, that the normalization is very much in line with our expectations quite frankly.

Not necessarily. There's been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go. Certainly travel growth

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a really good quarter. I mean, Discover has been a model of
consistency over the last decade plus, so it's just good to see. Just on your Cashback Debit product, just thoughts
on the growth of that business, the penetration rate.
Any comments on some of the other banking-like products in early paycheck, what kind of demand you're seeing
for that product? And then, economically, how you're going to monetize, these banking products over time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. It's still early days. So I probably won't provide much in the way of forecast, but we're very excited about the
demand we're seeing. We think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech
neobanks but also with any traditional branch player that's out there.
And over time, the balances build slowly, but a lot of opportunities to cross-sell, both other deposit products such
as savings accounts and CDs, but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point
into the Discover franchise.
So very much our focus is on building this for the long term. And as we said earlier, you'll start seeing more broad
market advertising later this year for that product.

Robert Napoli Q

done so very nicely. But just any thoughts on the competitive position today versus, say, five years ago.

Yes. I mean, I'd go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around 10 years of consistency,
right? Even five years ago, a brand value proposition that stood for trust, for a superior customer experience and
for innovation on the feature side. Back then, it might have been the ability to freeze your card; now it's some of
the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online. But the focus remains the same.
A very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there. You're pricing a little more
intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic. But we still
compete very much the same way, but also still feel as good about our competitive position.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, obviously really solid results here this quarter. So I
guess congratulations on that. But maybe you could just talk a little bit about Washington. We're hearing more
noises out there, both from the CFPB on the late fees, and which, I guess, to a certain extent, kind of plays into
your brand, about less fees and being consumer-friendly, but still, obviously, will have an impact for you to the
extent. I think yesterday, he announced – or this week he announced, he's talking about reopening the CARD Act
and the fees there, but also just on the student loan forgiveness side too. We're hearing more rumblings on that.
So just what's going on with Washington, your views on the situation? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Sure. So on the fee side, first, I'd say we have good relationships and enjoy working closely with all of our
regulators and by and large, are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected. [Technical Difficulty]
(00:53:29) as you've seen, it's a pretty small percent of our revenues. We waive the first late fee for our Discover
it customers anyway. Right now, we're set at the safe harbor. To the extent that that changes, we can change
accordingly. But don't expect it to have an overly material impact.
Certainly, on the deposit side, the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products positions us very, very
well compared to our competitors, and it's a key part of our value proposition.
In terms of student loans, we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing
payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan. It's important to realize though that there's a big
difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to, the types of
educations they fund. As an example, we do nothing in the for-profit sector. So, yeah, we'll wait and see what
comes out of Washington, but we don't expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business.

Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe turning back to credit for a second. Obviously, you're improving the
outlook for this year. But – how much of that is just a function of you gaining increased confidence based on and
the 1Q outperformance maybe versus any kind of change? I guess really what I'm trying to understand is, is the
path to normalization changing? Or is the curve like from here like a little less steep than what you had maybe
expected it to be – like when do we get back to a normalized state? Is it the front half of 2023, the back half of
2023, 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Thanks for the question, Mihir. What we said previously is we expect that normalization through 2023. Now
it's really hard to kind of predict anything when you get out, out into the kind of 2024 timeframe. What I would say
here is in terms of narrowing the range, that was a function largely of increased confidence around our forecast
with, frankly, an internal expectation that we're going to come in at the lower end of the range. So we're still giving
ourselves some wiggle room here. But if things proceed as we expect them to, we'll be around the lower end of
the range.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess – turning to the student lending business. I
mean it's important. I know it's small but important overall. But your results have been pretty consistent there, but
I'm wondering maybe if you just have any thoughts on the moratorium, its impact on your business. And more
importantly is, when the moratorium expires, is there any broader effect that you would expect to see on overall
credit trends even outside that specific segment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yes. We've modeled it pretty carefully. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans.
And as you think about student loans, it's important to look at how we underwrite those, right? For our undergrad
loans, the vast majority are cosigned by the parent, very strong FICO scores. So we've seen probably a modest
benefit on the benefit on the credit side, but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more
liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans. And again, I'd go back to the federal student loan
program in terms of who participates, the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance
is dramatically different than our portfolio.

Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Just a quick question on the personal loan portfolio. I guess are you
sort of tightening standards there just given the pristine early stage and loss rates that we've seen there. But I'm
also looking at the sequential sort of seven-quarter decline in yield. So just wanted to get your thoughts there? Or
is it just sort of primarily the elevated payment rates that's driving that? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes, it's a couple of factors that are playing out here. So the first piece was when we came in – prior to coming
into the pandemic, we were pretty tight. And then we hit the pandemic and we tightened the personal loan product
more stringently than any other product we had. What – and then we also we doubled down on our underwriting,
including 100% verification of all loans. So we were super careful. That had an impact on growth levels. We have
since reduced our manual underwriting. So it's back to kind of pre-pandemic underwriting standards.
And we also opened up the credit box because what we are seeing is the loans that were in there were pristine.
And we're now in a situation where we've got a high-returning asset. We're looking at the competitive dynamics.
We've made some conscious choice to reduce yield for the benefit of very profitable growth. And as I said earlier
in my comments, the expectation is that the payment rate will subside, and we'll see growth in loan balances in
that product. Originations have been positively strong, as I said earlier as well.
