Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening, and I'm
joined here today by Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer.
I'd like to start things off by reflecting upon my first full year, sharing highlights for the quarter and providing a
quick update on our strategic initiatives. From there, Chris will walk through an update on our funding and
margins, [ph] income (00:02:04) statement trends and capital. And then Pat will follow up with an update on
grants.
So last fall, we announced a new digital forward, growth-focused strategic plan built on Associated Banc's
foundation of strong credit and expense management. Our strategic plan is already well into the execution phase,
and we are driving significant positive core operating leverage, improving our ROATCE, and transforming our
systems to more efficiently serve our customers over time.
Our plan called for us to grow middle market lending. As you'll see, we've significantly grown and deepened our
core existing middle market and small business relationships. Our plan called for us to expand our lending
capabilities by adding higher-yielding asset classes in asset-based lending, equipment finance and auto finance.
All three of these verticals are now driving growth. And our plan called for us to shift investment dollars from brick-
and-mortar assets to digital platforms. And we expect the first of these digital updates to be rolled out to our
customers later this quarter.
But let me be clear. While we're excited to see these investments in growth and digital come to life, we are also
committed to sticking with the foundational principles that got us here, our disciplined approach to credit and
expense management. Taken together, after a full four quarters on the job, I'm even more impressed with the
quality of the team and more convinced that we're on track to deliver higher revenue growth, continued positive
operating leverage, and improving value for our stakeholders.
Now turning to the current environment in the most recent quarter. While the macroeconomic environment has
shifted over the past year, here in our markets, we've continued to see signs of strength. Unemployment levels
remain at near all-time lows in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Our business customers remain upbeat in their
outlooks, and our core consumer households are proving financially resilient.
On the commercial side, we hinted at improving commercial activity and upward line utilization trends back in the
spring, and that activity continued to ramp [ph] up throughout quarter (00:04:20). By June, line utilization reverted
to pre-pandemic levels as our customers continued to grow and expand.
On the consumer front, we saw steady activity as households purchased homes, put their home equity to work
and purchased [ph] autos (00:04:37), all while keeping steady deposit balances. These trends, complemented by
our selective additions of new RMs and our continued expansion of our initiative verticals, contributed to one of
the strongest loan growth quarters in our company's history. And importantly, we accomplished this while growing
point-to-point deposits and seeing further improvements in credit. We see this as a testament to the stability and
resilience of our customers and markets, but it's also a clear indication that our initiatives are having an impact.
Looking ahead, there is no denying that there are significant question marks remaining in the economy. The
continuing war in Ukraine, COVID lockdowns in China, inflation and supply chain disruptions, they all pose risks.
But our customer base remains strong, and we feel that we're very well-positioned to support them with an
expanding variety of products and services without stretching on credit. Our optimism stems from the fact that

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
we're growing in our core markets with our core customers and are comfortable with our credit, capital and
liquidity outlook as we look to the back half of the year.
With that, let me touch on a few highlights outlined on slide 2. Our second quarter results reflected robust loan
growth, expanding margins, stable deposits, and resilient credit trends. Through a combination of normalizing
business trends, a ramp-up of our initiatives and generally rising rates, our revenues increased 15% year-over-
year, while expenses were held to just 4% year-over-year. This drove a significant improvement in pre-tax pre-
provision income and another quarter of 13% plus returns on tangible common equity.
We also continued to see improving credit dynamics throughout our portfolios. In fact, we had less than 1 basis
point of net charge-offs for the quarter. We also resolved several nonperforming asset situations and saw
significant declines in non-accrual asset levels throughout the quarter. Together, these improving credit factors
allowed us to absorb this quarter's loan growth with zero net loan provision.
Now let me give some more color around our commercial loan dynamics, shifting to slide 3. As we move past the
halfway point in 2022, the uptick in line utilization has clearly been a driver of our balances. On the left side, our
PPP runoff has been more than offset by new activity in line uptick. Fueled by general commercial originations,
CRE expansion, and growth from our new verticals, average total commercial balances have grown strongly over
the past quarter. And line utilization has now reverted to pre-pandemic historical levels.
Turning to slide 4. While we are pleased with the rebound we've seen on the commercial side, we're also pleased
to report growth in nearly every vertical. The chart on the right-hand side shows this diversified growth. While
general commercial led the growth for the quarter, we also added significant balances in consumer, commercial
real estate, and specialized portfolios. And as you can see, we have broad-based growth reflecting the strength of
our franchise and the diversified impact of our strategic initiatives.
Based on the robust trends we've just discussed, we're revising our full-year loan targets higher on slide 5. Given
the continued strength in our markets, we now expect to end the year with approximately $17 billion of
outstanding core commercial loan balances. This outlook includes expected further moderation on mortgage
warehouse portfolio runoff and the runoff of our remaining PPP book. We continue to drive progress in our new
ABL and equipment finance verticals, with both teams adding new high-quality balances to our books. We remain
confident in the team's ability to hit the $300 million combined target we've set for the end of the year. Taken
together, we expect our total commercial book to end the year at approximately $17.3 billion.
Now, turning to consumer lending, we continue to be impressed with our auto team's ability to drive high-quality
balances that help diversify our loan book. And while this team is relatively new to Associated, they've been doing
this for decades in a variety of economic environments without sacrificing on quality. This makes the team a great
fit for us from a risk mindset and cultural perspective, and we're confident we're on track to hit our year-end
targets. We also continue to expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of
the year.
So to summarize, the growth we saw in the second quarter is driven by the resilience of our core customers and
the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and investments. Our results provide us optionality to pursue high-
quality risk-aware lending across a diversified set of business lines without the need to stretch on credit in the
current environment.
On slide 6, we show a five-quarter trend of our PTPP income. A year ago, we drew a line in the sand and stated
that $78 million was a baseline that we would improve upon. PTPP income has consistently performed above that

level in each subsequent quarter, and we remain on track to deliver strong positive operating leverage throughout
the remainder of 2022.
So let me pause there. I'm going to hand it over to Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a little more
detail on our funding, revenue and income statement trends for the quarter. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 7. We recognized that having access to core customer deposits and other low-cost
funding sources is more important than ever, particularly as we look to fund growth on the asset side of the
balance sheet. That's why we've taken meaningful steps in recent years to grow our core customer deposit base
while reducing our reliance on higher-cost wholesale funding sources. As we sit here today, we've started this rate
cycle from a much better funding position than where we were in 2016. We expect to hold wholesale funding to
approximately 15% of total funding going forward. Despite recent macro volatility, our core deposit customers
have remained resilient. While we typically would expect to see deposit outflows in the first half of the calendar
year, we've actually seen modest net deposit growth versus the prior quarter and year-end, and our consumer
and commercial mix has remained stable, reflecting consistent balances by business segment over the last
several quarters. Our consistent growth in low-cost deposit categories has resulted in a franchise with deposit
costs well below peer medians. Given our profile, we feel well-positioned to control our deposit betas going
forward.
Slide 8 highlights our asset sensitivity and our ability to manage funding costs in a rising rate cycle. Year-to-date,
we've seen a significant uptick in the average yields of most of our earning asset categories. Since the fourth
quarter of last year, earning asset yields have increased by 38 basis points on average or roughly 55% of the
increase we've seen in average Fed funds over the same period. Our assets are fundamentally positioned to
participate with further rate increases.
On the liability side, year-to-date interest earning liability costs have only increased by 9 basis points or roughly
13% of the move in average Fed funds. This reflects our ability to lag funding costs as rates rise and to capture
margin in higher rate level environments. This widening gap between rapidly rising asset yields and more
moderately increasing liability costs is the core benefit of our structural asset-sensitive profile.
Slide 9 highlights the resulting NIM expansion that comes from this structural asset sensitivity and the related
growth in net interest income that is derived from that profile. Our net interest margin expanded from 2.5% in the
month of March to 2.78% for the month of June, consistent with our quarterly expansion of 29 basis points on an
average. On a dollar NII basis, our growth in structural asset sensitivity provided a $28 million lift to revenue in the
quarter.
Moving on to slide 10, we've laid out several of the factors that give us confidence that we're well positioned for
the cycle ahead. First, as demonstrated during the second quarter, Associated is more asset sensitive today than
we were heading into last cycle. Roughly 90% of our commercial portfolio will re-price or reset within the year,
which boosts our one-year cumulative re-pricing gap.
Second, as previously mentioned, we work to improve the mix of low-cost core customer funding to liabilities.
Since 2016, low-cost deposits have grown from less than half to more than two-thirds of our total deposits. This
has also contributed to our increasing asset-sensitive profile.

We would also like to highlight that Associated benefits from a highly granular deposit base relative to our peers.
This reflects our emphasis on building stable, sticky household and small business relationships throughout our
footprint. Bottom line, we are structurally in a better place today than we were in the last cycle and we're confident
that we're operating from a position of strength as we head into back half of this year.
We now expect the Fed to raise short-term rates by 75 basis points at the July FOMC meeting and potentially an
additional 25 basis points at each remaining FOMC meeting later this year. Based on these assumptions and our
loan growth expectations, we now expect our full year net interest income to exceed $890 million.
Turning to slide 11, we've highlighted some noninterest income trends. While fee income continues to be a
headwind for the industry, we actually saw modest net growth versus the prior quarter and the same period last
year. In Q2, increases in card-based fees and other fee-based revenues partially offset the anticipated reductions
in mortgage banking and wealth management fees. I'll remind you that we expect to see fee income moderate
beginning in the third quarter based on the implementation of the new [ph] OD NSS (00:15:47) changes we
announced last quarter. We also expect commercial deposit account fees to move slightly lower as higher rates
translate into higher ECRs.
With the expectation for continued rise in rates, we also see mortgage banking revenue further moderating as we
move through the back half of the year. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our most recent full year noninterest
income guidance and continue to expect total noninterest income of between $290 million and $300 million in
2022.
Moving on to slide 12. Second quarter expenses came in at $181 million. This represents a 4% year-over-year
increase in expenses, consistent with our prior guidance. Driven by higher revenues and controlled expenses, our
efficiency ratio continues to improve.
As I stated previously, expect to continue to scale up investments in people and technology, but remain
committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth. Taking all of our initiatives into consideration, we
are tightening our expense guidance for the full year. We now expect full year 2022 noninterest expense to come
in between $730 million and $740 million, which is within our prior range.
Moving on to capital, slide 13, we managed capital levels towards the lower end of our range as we supported
customer loan growth during the quarter. Nonetheless, given our enhanced profitability trends, we fully expect
TCE will grow through year-end and we will end the year in a 7.25% to 7.5% range. We also expect CET1 will end
the year between 9.25% and 9.75%.
Now, let me turn it over to Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Chris. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 14. We've utilized the
Moody's May 2022 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast
remained fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes increasing Fed rate actions and minimal COVID
impact. Following five consecutive quarters of net reserve releases, we posted a net zero provision in Q2 with
less than 1 basis point of net charge-offs for the quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Our ACLL at June 30 was flat from the prior quarter at $318 million, with additions for loan growth and economic
factors fully offset by releases from declining NPAs and other credit improvements, totaling approximately $14
million. Our ratio of reserves to loans declined from 1.3% to 1.2% during the quarter.
Turning to slide 15, we highlight our quarterly credit trends. Overall, credit metrics remained strong, with
continued improvement in nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans as a positive indicator of the health of the
portfolio.
As compared to Q1, total nonperforming assets decreased by 22% in Q2, while nonaccrual loans decreased by
24%. Of note, our $10 billion commercial and business lending book currently has under $1 million of nonaccrual
loans, which equates to less than 1 basis point.
We would also highlight that across our entire book delinquencies, which are a leading indicator of potential
problem loans, were just 7 basis points at quarter-end.
Shifting to slide 16, we spent more than a decade bolstering the credit foundation of Associated. As you can see,
we've built a bank that is diversified and balanced, with a discipline on culture and a focus on quality. Of note,
year-to-date, our net charge-offs [audio gap] (00:19:46) zero and our total nonaccruals are down about one-third
year-over-year.
Strong growth in the second quarter was driven by investing in our [ph] core business (00:19:55), growing our
core relationships and expanding our engagement with customer segments with which we are very familiar. With
that said, we are fully aware of the warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in both portfolio
management as well as sensitizing underwriting to reflect rising interest rates, elevated inflation, supply chain
disruption and labor costs, to name a few economic concerns.
Going forward, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes
and other indications of credit quality.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. On slide 17, we recap our updated full year guidance for 2022. First, we remain bullish about quality
loan growth over the back half of the year and we're updating our outlook as a result. Specifically, we now expect
full year total commercial loan growth of approximately $1.7 billion in 2022. We continue to expect full year auto
finance growth of approximately $1.3 billion.
We now anticipate a 75-basis-point increase at this month's FOMC meeting and a 25-basis-point increase at each
remaining FOMC meeting this year. As such, we expect our full year 2022 net interest income to exceed $890
million. We continue to expect total noninterest income of between $290 million and $300 million for the full year.
And taken together, we now expect the combined total of net interest income and fee income to exceed $1.18
billion.
Lastly, we remain committed to expense discipline, and we're tightening our noninterest expense guidance as a
result. We now expect between $730 million and $740 million of noninterest expense in 2022.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Before we move to Q&A, I want to acknowledge that this call marks Chris Niles' last quarterly earnings call before
he retires. Since joining Associated in 2010, Chris has had a tremendously positive impact on the company and
has put us in an excellent position as we look to build on our strong foundation. From here, we're looking forward
to the addition of two experienced leaders to our executive leadership team. Bryan Carson officially joined us
earlier this week as our new Chief Product and Marketing Officer, while Derek Meyer will be joining Associated as
our new CFO at the beginning of August.
As I've stated previously, I believe we are making the CFO transition from a position of strength, especially given
our positive momentum in the first half of the year. Adding Derek and Bryan to the team will bolster our current
growth strategy as we look to deepen relationships, generate deposits, and execute our digital transformation.
This will further drive Associated forward on our path to value creation. And despite the macro headwinds in the
near term, we are executing our strategy in real time. And I'm confident our ability to deliver strong performance
for our stakeholders now and in the years to come.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Andy, I know you've been quite optimistic on the
potential for loan growth, but what we saw this quarter was pretty exceptional. I guess were you surprised by the
pace of the loan growth? Was there anything that was pulled forward from trying to get ahead of higher rates
within that number? And as you look at an optimistic second half of the year, maybe talk through some of the
industries and verticals where you think the majority of that incremental loan growth is going to be coming from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Well, thank you for the question. First, I'd say – I wouldn't say that we were surprised. What I'd say is we
had every – we had diversification of growth. So we had growth in almost every single category.
As we look, we did get a little tailwind on usage on commercial line utilization. We don't expect that tailwind in the
second half of the year. You can see in our forecast, we still expect very nice growth, but nothing where you'd
take the second quarter and multiply it. It starts to dampen just a little bit, whether that's from an economy
standpoint or our ability to be selective now that we have options on where we grow to try to drive value.
So, we feel very good about what occurred. And frankly, when you transition your assets, as we did, as we took
some nonperforming or some real estate assets and transition that into the RM ranks, we were able to grow, not
expand our credit box and still get some quality loan growth across the board.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, as you're looking to fund future loan growth, are there initiatives or visibility into incremental
deposits coming online in the second half of the year to kind of supplement that growth or will you continue
leaning on FHLBs to kind of bridge the gap?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. No, with the growth that we expect in second half of the year, we expect largely to be able to fund that vis-
à-vis our deposit growth. We have had a number of initiatives that we've been working on from our HSA to having
our commercial RMs focused on deposit acquisition, to having our business banking RMs focused on deposit
acquisition, to launching the mass-affluent vertical in the last half of the year, to work in digital account opening, to
having a focus on liquidity management or Treasury management for our RMs. So, we feel pretty good about
being able to increase the trajectory of our loan growth.
We've demonstrated the ability on our deposit growth. We've demonstrated that ability to execute on loan
initiatives, and I'm expecting that we'll be able to execute on the deposit initiatives as well. But I will say
structurally, we do have the luxury of being different this time than in 2016 coming through that rate cycle. Right
now, we have reliance of about 15% on wholesale network deposits versus six years ago, where we had a 30%
reliance on those deposits.
So, we do have the ability to borrow from the FHLB, but our intent is to continue to drive core funding. And with
the path that we're on, we feel very good about meeting the deposit betas. You can see we had a strong deposit
beta coming through this quarter, and our forecast is 30% to 40% for the year. And we feel like with the mix, we're
right in line to achieve that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And Timur, we would highlight also seasonally, we'd normally expect to lose deposits through the tax season.
That happened. We saw a stepdown from March into April. And then those balances basically held through the
second quarter.
Seasonally, though, we would also expect to generally see an uptick in the third quarter as we move towards the
September and the funding cycle for municipal governments and the collection of property taxes later in the year.
That's historically been a net benefit and a tailwind for us, and we have no reason to believe we won't see that
this year as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And then just lastly for me, looking at some of the wholesale borrowing that
was taken on, it looks like balances increased while the cost of that actually declined. Can you talk through that
dynamic? Was there some incremental duration that was added there? Yeah. Just any color on that decline in
costs would be appreciated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We do have a little color. We have a little color around that. Chris, why don't you take that one?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So in general, two things. Specific to the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, we did restructure some of
our term advances. As rates moved up, we were able to exit those with no penalty, no prepayment fee, and
moved those into a more advantageous funding profile. Second, we also had the retirement, and you'll see that in
sort of total cost of funds, of our senior notes, which obviously is flowing through now as a positive to the total
wholesale funding costs.

question.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good afternoon.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Hi, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Just wanted to get kind of revisit funding a bit. So, I mean, the funding profile, there's no question. It's
significantly better. You guys have such strong loan growth that's outstripping deposits materially. I guess you're
sort of getting towards one of the higher loan-to-deposit ratios.
So like what kind of loan-to-deposit ratio do you target? I imagine we'll get there fairly soon. So, thereafter, what's
the sort of the plan to fund the strong loan growth? And understanding that loan growth, overall, will probably
temper down a bit, but just curious for your thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, I'll start this. Chris, if you want to jump in. So, ending the quarter around 92%, 92.7% in loan-to-deposit
ratio, our expectation is that we have multiple areas that we're going to be able to attract core deposits. So,
largely, we'd like to keep that number between 90% and 95%, which we expect and hope to do.

If that is not possible, as we know, we have some ability to get wholesale funding. But I would say just as the loan
initiatives got going for us and the execution on that, there's a clear path for liquidity management, Treasury
management. When you do that, you get more commercial deposits from your customers.
There is a clarity for me when I see the numbers on mass affluent that we're underpenetrated in our customer
base. This will be the third time that I've launched a mass-affluent strategy. So, have a pretty clear indication that
there's significant dollars available to us.
Our account opening, we will work on a new account opening on digital in the fourth quarter of the year. That will
only gain momentum as we go into year-end and the first quarter. We've added resources on the HSA side of
things. That business starts to ramp up towards the end of the year and the first quarter, so we'll continue to get
balances there.
So, while we'd like to stay at the 95% and below range, we also think the deposit initiatives, which we've been
working on for quite some time, will continue to kick in in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter, in the second
quarter of next year as loan growth, I think, dampens. I mean it was a very good quarter for us, but it dampens...

Yeah.

Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And Scott, the only thing I would add to that is if you look back at some of our prior earnings deck and investor
decks, we used to highlight the seasonal factors that drove our loan-to-deposit ratio...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
...and the second quarter has historically been our peak loan-to-deposit ratio period and usually our fourth quarter
is [ph] a low (00:31:57). And so we have no reason to believe that some of those seasonal deposits aren't going
to swing the way they usually do, and that will contribute to an improving profile there.

Okay. Perfect. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
But even with wholesale funding, we believe strongly we can hold the margins that we forecasted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then I guess as we continue to go, do you just sort of naturally become a little less
asset-sensitive than if the loan growth still get – grip some things? I mean, it's going to be great and I have
trajectory here through the remainder of the year, just trying to get a sense for what the rate sensitivity profile will
look like as we go into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. That's one of the things we really like is on the way up, we're very asset-sensitive and you can see that.
That has worked to our benefit. But the initiatives that we have are larger on the fixed rate side, whether that be
asset-based lending, whether that be equipment finance, whether that be auto lending. So, as we're taking
advantage of getting a peak in rates, we expect that there is a dampening to asset sensitivity as we reach that
peak and have a potential for a decrease in interest rates at some point in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Scott, I think internally, we've sometimes discussed it as sort of the traditional bond portfolio laddering. We've
been laddering into higher rate fixed rate assets as the market has been moving higher and we're going to be the
beneficiary of that laddering up in this cycle here over the next couple of quarters. And if the cycle turns, will we
have the benefit? Those are less prepayment-sensitive asset classes than our historical reliance on mortgage to
play that part in our portfolio.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Chris, maybe a question. I think we've asked in the past what each 25 basis points means. I know
we're moving in chunks, but we've all got different rate assumptions. Just trying to see if our rate forecast is a little
bit different than yours and what the incremental benefit could be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So as we've said, it's roughly $1 million per month for each 25-basis-point increment above our forecast.
So we're calling for 75 basis points here at the end of July, that's baked in, and 25 basis points at each remaining
meeting. That's baked into the $890 million-plus. But to extent you had an extra 25 basis points because it was
100 basis points here in July or because one of the subsequent meetings ended up being 50 basis points, it
would be $1 million per month in the period following that rate increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then, Andy, maybe one for you. Just a bigger picture question. You've got a lot of momentum
on the initiatives. Can you just remind us like the long-term targets, ROE, ROA efficiency? Obviously, rates dictate
a lot of that. But just how you're thinking about levels and timing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So I think maybe I'll jump in. Initially, we said we're driving towards a 2.75% margin over the near term. In
the month of June, we got to 2.78%. So that feels like we're going to be hitting that goal here pretty soon.
We've also said we'd be driving towards a 60% – 55% to 60% efficiency ratio. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency
ratio came in at 59.8%, so we feel like we're moving in the right direction on that one. And our adjusted efficiency
ratio at just over 60% is consistent with that move.
And finally, we'd say we've targeted mid-teens ROTCE on a consistent basis and we came in at 13% again this
quarter. So I feel pretty confident that we're on the right trajectory to get to a mid-teens level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Perfect. Thanks, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Chris, I thought Chris Niles took the softball on that one by – on the margin one at 2.78% with a forecast of
2.75%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I guess, first, just a clarification on the impact in the second quarter of the
excess cash deployment. Obviously, that was because of the tremendous loan growth you had in the quarter. But
are you able to strip out kind of the – what the impact of the mix shift was on the margin relative to just the rate
hike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think the way we think about it, again, roughly using that $1 million per month, the $1 million per month we had
previously guided to a 25% benefit and, obviously, we saw more than that in the May and June action. So those
sort of stacked on top of each other, drove a good portion of the outperformance. But, yes, part of it was from
cash utilization, the balance sheet growth factor, and the other part was from the rates. But I think if you back out
the $1 million a month for the rate bumps, you can solve for the residual, which is sort of the balance effects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, my second question is on the expense guidance. The guidance assumes kind of a ramp-up in
the back half of the year in terms of annualized growth from last year. Just curious how we should think about
growth kind of in the fourth quarter or that base in the fourth quarter entering 2023 if the number should just flow
freely into 2023, or do you think annualized expense growth once we get past the fourth quarter is a better way to
look at it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I would refer you back to our prior investor presentations where we said that over the 2022-2023 horizon, we
expected to keep overall expense growth in that 4% zone. We've delivered 4% this year. Our baseline is that
we're going to try and be disciplined about expenses going forward as well. So we're going to hit the range that
we've given to you and we're going to see expense growth next year. We think it'll be in line with our overall long-
term guidance.
And I would say that it is in a ramp up, but in part it's ramping up because a number of the technology initiatives
that we've been working on for the last nine months are going to come into play and be put into service here and
that will start amortizing through our expense base. And we've still got hiring that we're working our way through
that is going to come online and have a full-year effect that's going to roll into the third and fourth quarters. So we
continue to invest in technology. We continue to invest in people. Those will bump the numbers, but we're growing
revenues even faster, and we'll be disciplined about how that grows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And what we've said before with regards to expenses, we'd only spend that money if we're driving revenue. And
so, we are hitting the revenue targets and exceeding them. Of course, it's a combination now of both growth and
margin due to the accelerated rate environment. What I would say, though, when we look at fourth quarter, we'll
try to do is we'll position ourselves as we've said we'd do every single year to acknowledge that there's a change

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
in the industry, there's a change in the marketplace. And we will try to make strategic cuts to redeploy that
expense back into the business. So, as we look at that in the fourth quarter, we took action on real estate last
year, we'll look across whatever we think is a less-producing asset and what we can put back into the revenue-
producing and the support groups and the technology initiatives that we have as a company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. Terrific. I appreciate that color. It's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Good afternoon, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Afternoon, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe the first question, just to dig back into the expenses. You continue to hire new teams. There's the
equipment finance team last week. And so, I guess just to be clear, the fourth quarter expense run rate, do you
think that'll capture the team building, the run rate, or will there continue to be growth off that fourth quarter as you
continue to kind of opportunistically add commercial lenders and build out those teams?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
There'll continue to be puts and takes as we build the expense, but we feel a lot of confidence that we're still in
that 4% range that we've said. I feel like the number for next year with our long-term forecasting is still in that
range. So we've been able to steadily build.
One of the other questions that we've been asked is, are you committed to growing the same number of
relationship managers, and what I would say to that is we've had a lot of success bringing in talent and getting our
own relationship managers' productivity up. And so we will be selective in who we bring in. We'll bring in – if
there's a talented RM out there, we'd hire them. I don't feel pressure to be at a 15% to 20% because we have the
run rate that we need to hit our midterm targets.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
So there's no pressure on adding, but now we're in a position where we can decide where we add and make sure
that we have the discipline around the expense approach and stay within those targets that we stated from the
beginning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then as a follow-up, could you maybe comment on any market disruption in Chicago or Milwaukee, which are
two important markets for you, and whether you've been able to capitalize on any of that in terms of talent or
customers and what your strategy is, given the window to possibly gain share? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We've been able to add new names. We've gotten relationship managers from almost every major national and
regional bank in our footprint. So the answer is yes. I believe we've been able to take advantage of that. And we
brought in some folks that have immediately come in and started producing. And our existing group is bringing in
new names as well. So I feel very good about the core franchise in our footprint and bringing in relationships.
So the answer is yes. We feel like we've been able to take advantage of some of the disruption, but I feel very
optimistic throughout the footprint. We've added very talented players in our Northeast Wisconsin. We've added
folks in Minneapolis. We've added people, key people in Milwaukee and Chicago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
And, Terry, the only thing I'll add to that is when we look at our commercial and business loan portfolio quarter-
over-quarter and we think about where do we add the most, Wisconsin, Illinois, we're at the top of the list. When
we think about the specific commercial banking little sub markets where we operate, Milwaukee, Chicago and
Minneapolis basically led the commercial banking pack. That's exactly where we want to be. That's exactly where
we're seeing the uptick. And I think that speaks to the diversification of growth that we saw across the franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Chris. And we'll miss you on all these calls after all those years. You definitely taught me to read
the press release, look at the supplement before asking a question because you were always quick to point that

Jon Arfstrom Q

Hey, thanks. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Once you're gone, Chris, we're just going to ask Derek to do the work for us, but we're going to have to wait for
you [indiscernible] (00:44:26). Question on for Pat. We haven't talked about credit at all. I think because it's so
clean. But on slide 14, there's an up arrow for qualitative and economic factors in your reserving. Can you talk a
little bit about that and what you have built in there in terms of some of your assumptions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I think what we tried to capture there is just the unknowns that we talked about in the marketplace. And
obviously, there's a lot of macroeconomic factors that are creating some uncertainty. We're not blind to that, and
we wanted to build that in and acknowledge that looking forward.
I think what we're doing now, there's nothing – I wouldn't say there's any overarching issues or concerns being
raised right now, but there's clearly inflation, continued supply chain, rising interest rates. These are all things that
point toward potential recession risk, and we wanted to be able to capture that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That knocked out one of my questions in terms of not really seeing any stress. But one other question I had
was on auto. Can you just remind us of some of the risk management factors you built in on auto and then touch
a little bit on pricing? Not being critical, but it looks kind of flattish and I'm just curious what you're seeing on
pricing and do you expect yields to rise there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. I think slide 16, Jon, has some of the core credit discipline factors around that. And, Pat, I think you've got
LTV factors and FICO factors. And then, I'll jump in just on pricing. To your comment, yes, we've seen pricing be
relatively tight there. We would expect that to rise broadly as rates overall rise. So I would expect to see that drift
higher as we move to the back half of the year, but let me turn it back to Pat for credit.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Yeah. I think from a from a risk management standpoint, we're constantly watching the valuation of what's going
on in the marketplace. We're reacting in terms of new applications and what we're seeing to what trends may or
may not be happening. We've got a lot of internal monitoring processes in place to deal with not only customers
that we're lending to, but also dealerships that we're working with. So we're constantly monitoring and we've got a
lot of internal scorecards that kind of give us leading indicators of what's going on there in that marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Jon, if you remember, we actually – this is Andy. We actually bought this – the legacy data customer information,
so that we had a balanced scorecard that was tested with the – back test with customer information already. So it
wasn't a matter of us just using the go forward information to build our models. And with that, I'd tell you we're
97% prime and super prime. We're 75% super.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just one, if I can squeeze in one more, a kind of a nonfinancial question. But you talked
about, Bryan, your new Marketing and Product Officer. What are you charging him with, Andy, and what kind of
goals would you set for somebody like that as you continue to try to grow the company? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Yeah, great question. So Bryan is somebody I know pretty well and what he is, is he has a strength on the
data analytics, the customer insights and success in driving growth via understanding customer and differentiation
on product. He also led much of the digital sales work that we did on the consumer side of the bank.
So when you think about understanding what matters to people that switch on the marketing side, when you think
about building a product that matters and you think about doing that digitally, to me, that's where the industry is
going on the consumer side of the business in particular. But he also had awareness on the commercial side of
the business.
And so when you marry the ability to understand liquidity and how to drive and capture customers with the ability
to work with our new CFO who has expertise on liquidity management and FP&A, I'm really very excited about
each one of them individually, and I'm probably even more excited about the combination and how they work
together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. I appreciate that. Chris, best of luck. I'm looking at your age here and SNL, and you're younger than
I am. And I kind of wonder what I'm doing wrong. And you're retiring. But I just I do wish you the best of luck,
okay?
