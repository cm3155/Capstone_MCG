Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and those closest to you are healthy and staying
safe. Before addressing our quarter results, I'd first like to discuss the current business environment in Puerto
Rico and how we're responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as outlined in the first three slides of the presentation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, creating significant volatility and
disruption in financial markets and increasing unemployment level. The Puerto Rico macro indicator that we
regularly provide remained stable through the end of February. However, the pandemic and related economic
disruption has had a very dramatic impact on the markets we serve.
The local response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been substantial. On March 15, the Governor of Puerto Rico
mandated a strict lockdown for residents and ordered all non-essential business on the island to close indefinitely.
Most business establishments are closed and those that remain open are only operating partially, causing a
significant disruption to the island's economic activity. Only businesses involved in providing essential services as
defined by the Governor's executive order have been permitted to remain open.
And even those that have been – even those have been curtailed in their operations. For example, banks have
had to temporarily suspend mortgage and auto loan origination. The severe lockdown restrictions have also
disrupted commercial lending.
Additionally, the Puerto Rico government has mandated its citizens to remain sheltered in place and imposed a
mandatory 7 PM curfew. Puerto Rico was the first US jurisdiction to enact this scale of a lockdown.
Moody's Analytics estimates that approximately 80% of Puerto Rico's $105 billion GDP has been impacted by this
lockdown. They estimate the economic costs through April 12 at approximately $6.3 billion and for as long as
these restrictions remain in effect, they estimate an additional cost of $1.6 billion per week and reduced economic
output.
While employment trends have remained stable through February, initial unemployment claims have spiked over
the past month in Puerto Rico, as they have across the entire United States. And as could be expected, tourism
has also been significantly impacted.
The Puerto Rico Tourism Company estimates the total hotel occupancy to be approximately 8% According to the
operator of the San Juan International Airport, during January and February, Puerto Rico received 14% more
passengers than 2019.
However, during March, arrivals dropped by 38% when compared to March 2019, dropping over 73% over the
last two weeks of the month and they have continued to drop. The curfew and stay at home order have also had a
dramatic impact on the spending patterns of our clients.
Customer purchase activity has been severely impacted. Like employment trends through February were stable
compared to the year ago period. However, for the 30 days after the curfew was enacted, debit and credit sales
decreased by 46% versus the same timeframe in 2019. Both the local and federal governments have begun to
provide relief and assistance in response to the pandemic.
To date, the Puerto Rico government has approved a $787 million fiscal stimulus plan. Additionally, as part of the
CARES Act, Puerto Rico will receive approximately $5 billion in funds, including up to $1.5 billion in direct
payments.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Residents of Puerto Rico are also entitled to receive the supplemental federal unemployment benefit of $600 per
week. Our management team has been closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and has taken measures to
ensure the soundness of our operations and the safety of our employees and customers.
We've strengthened our business continuity plan and our executive team is constantly meeting to monitor and
implement actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. We are communicating regularly with our employees to
keep them informed of the involving business environment and to help ensure their safety.
We offered alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our employee base, provided incremental
training, added personal leave days and paid approximately $3.4 million in bonuses to frontline employees.
Branches are operating under compressed schedules, emphasizing drive thru where available and rotating
personnel to reduce exposure. I am deeply grateful to our colleagues for the effort, commitment and bravery
exhibited under very difficult circumstances.
We are encouraging customers to use alternative banking options such as our digital services, smart ATMs,
telephone banking and drive through services. We've increased transaction limits for remote deposits and ATMs.
We have also waived ATM and certain other fees, as well as early withdrawal penalties on CDs.
Most importantly, we are assisting customers facing financial difficulties, offering payment deferrals for mortgage,
auto and other consumer and commercial loans.
Finally, following the passage of the CARES Act, we mobilized our human and tech resources to offer SBA loans
to affected small and medium sized businesses. We have submitted more than $1.2 billion in loans, representing
more than 15,000 small and medium sized businesses. To-date, we have received confirmation of SBA approval
of $819 million of these submissions. We will continue to accept and process applications until the funding is
exhausted.
In our communities, we have committed $1 million to support efforts in four primary areas; providing medical
equipment to healthcare professionals, supporting locally based healthcare research projects to combat COVID-
19, providing financial advice and business continuity support to entrepreneurs and small and medium sized
businesses, and finally assisting non-profit organizations to ensure the continuity of their services. As we continue
to respond to this rapidly changing situation, our plans and actions will continue to evolve.
Please turn to slide 6. The quarter's results reflecting impact of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. Our reported quarterly net income of $34 million was significantly lower than our results for the fourth
quarter and compared to the first quarter of last year. The primary driver of this decrease was a substantially
higher provision expense, reflecting the newly adopted CECL accounting pronouncement and the most recent
post-COVID macroeconomic forecast for Puerto Rico and the US.
Aside from the increased provision, the first quarter results were characterized by higher net interest income,
lower operating expenses and lower taxes, partially offset by lower non-interest income.
In the quarter, our non-interest income was impacted by reduced merchant transaction activity, the waiving of
certain fees and service charges, the suspension of mortgage originations, as well as lower income due to the
COVID-19 disruptions over the last two weeks of March.

Additionally, we have experienced higher expenses related to expanding remote access for employees, additional
employee benefits, increased measures to protect employees and additional efforts related to customer relief
programs.
Excluding the adoption of CECL this quarter, credit quality metrics through March continue to show stable results.
The continuing impact of COVID-19 on the economy and our operations will be heavily dependent on advances in
the medical arena and how quickly economic activity can safely resume.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos who will discuss the financial results in more detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 7 for first quarter results. As usual, additional information
is provided in the appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release details variances from the fourth
quarter.
Net interest income for the quarter was $473 million, an increase of $6 million from the fourth quarter. The primary
driver of this increase was higher loan balances. We acquired a $74 million credit card portfolio at the end of
2019, saw continued growth in our commercial, auto and these portfolios in BPPR, as well as in the construction
and mortgage portfolios in Popular Bank.
Our deposit costs were down 15 basis points in the quarter due to the effect of lower market rates from Puerto
Rico public deposits and interest bearing deposits at Popular Bank. NIM for Q1 was 3.94%, an 11 basis point
improvement from last quarter. On a taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 4.34%, 14 basis points higher than in Q4.
However, we expect margins to decrease in Q2.
Previously, we have mentioned that the historical sensitivity of our net interest income to rate changes hovers
around $4 million to $5 million per quarter for every 25 basis point change in market rates. This sensitivity was not
evident in Q1 because the change of market rates in March happened very late in the quarter.
Q2 will reflect the full effect of lower rates, assuming no other material changes in asset mix. As has been the
case for the last couple of years, asset mix and the level of public deposits will also continue to have a material
effect on our margin.
As of the end of the first quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $10 billion, which is down slightly from
Q4. We still expect public deposit balances to come down over the long term. But COVID-related federal
assistance may increase balances in the near term.
The rate of expenditure of these funds and the timing of agreements on the government's debt restructuring will
dictate the amount and timing of any balance reduction. Our loan portfolio grew by $255 million in the quarter,
with our US business accounting for approximately $210 million of that increase.
Given the originations associated with PPP, we expect loan balances to be higher in the second quarter. While
we had previously anticipated slight growth in loan balances in 2020, given the current environment, that outlook
is now uncertain. The ultimate level of loan balances for 2020 will depend on the duration of the PPP loans and
the performance of the economy for the remaining of the year.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Provision expense for the quarter of $190 million reflects the adoption of CECL and incorporates the most recent
COVID affected macroeconomic forecast for Puerto Rico and the US. The quarter-over-quarter increase in
allowance for credit losses was $442 million or an increase of 93%. Lidio will expand on this during his credit
commentary.
Non-interest income decreased by $25.7 million. Nearly all fee categories decreased quarter over quarter.
Insurance fees were $5 million lower, primarily due to the CECL nature of contingent commissions, which are
higher in the second and fourth quarters. Credit and debit card fees were $5 million lower and we're [ph] seeing
none (14:11) of our markets in the last two weeks in March.
Mortgage results were negatively impacted by the evaluation adjustment of the MSR as compared to the prior
quarter. We also recognized $3 million in mortgage hedging losses, in part related to the government mandated
stoppage of mortgage origination in Puerto Rico since mid-March.
Finally, we had a $6 million unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves on loans sold with
recourse. The closure of business in our markets had an estimated negative effect on non-interest income of $5
million in Q1.
We currently expect that lower client activity and the waiving of various fees will have a negative effect on non-
interest income of about $8 million per month. The speed at which we can return to more trend like non-interest
income levels which average $135 million to $140 million per quarter over the last two years will depend on the
rate of reopening of our markets and the increase in client activity levels.
Total operating expenses were $373 million, $80 million lower than the prior quarter. Personal costs decreased by
$11.5 million. These decreases were driven by lower incentive compensation of $15.4 million, partially offset by a
special COVID-related incentive to frontline employees of $3.4 million.
Business promotion costs were $9 million lower in the first quarter. Approximately $4.3 million of this decrease
reflects the traditional seasonality of advertising, sponsorships and promotion. Reduced customer activity resulted
in lower reward program expenses of $3.2 million. These expense decreases were partially offset by slightly
higher OREO and other operating expenses.
In response to lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic on our business, we will be implementing
various cost saving initiatives that will affect personnel related expenses, professional fees, business promotion
and other operating expenses. We expect these efforts to result in savings of approximately $55 million in 2020.
As a result, we now expect average quarterly expenses for the year 2020 to be around $369 million as opposed
to our prior guidance of $383 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 8%, which reflects the impact of
lower taxable income, driven by a higher provision for credit losses due to CECL, which includes the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. For 2020, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be between 14% and 18%.
Please turn to slide 8. Our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect to well-
capitalized regulatory requirements. On January 30 of this year, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase
agreement or ASR for $500 million in common stock.
Under the terms of the ASR, our banking counterpart had the ability to terminate the ASR if the corporation's
stock price drops to a pre-specified level. The increase of our stock price resulting from the pandemic triggered
this clause, and our ASR was terminated on March 19.

This termination has two effects. First we realized a price discount on the real delivery of 7.1 million shares.
Second, the remaining $167 million yet to be delivered of the contract at termination time are settled via the
delivery of additional shares acquired by our counterpart via continued market purchases. At March 31, 2020, we
had received a total of 7.7 million shares. Through April 24, we have received an additional 2 million shares. We
expect the complete settlement on termination of the ASR to be closed out during the second quarter.
To complete our 2020 capital plan, we also increased our quarterly common stock dividend and redeemed our
8.25% Series B preferred stock. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q1 was 15.8%, down from 17.8%, and
tangible book value increased in the quarter by $1.07 per share to $56.17. The increase was driven by higher
unrealized gains on investment, our quarterly net income and a lower share count, offset somewhat by our $500
million buyback, the day one effect of CECL and the payment of our dividend.
These is many market participants are doing versions of burn down analysis, in this slide we include a calculation
of our pro forma capital ratios, applying the loss ratios of our last published DFAST severely adverse stress test
from 2017.
In this simulation, even after a severely adverse allowance for credit losses of $1.7 billion, we still end up with
very strong CET1 ratio of 13.9%. This results reflect Popular's robust capital position.
The first quarter of 2020 allowance for credit losses represents 54% of our severely adverse DFAST loss
estimate. Our return on tangible equity was 2.9% in the first quarter, affected by the previously described items,
mostly the provisions. We will continue to pursue our target [indiscernible] (20:26) return on tangible equity.
Before I return the call over to Lidio, as a result of the adoption of CECL, we increased our day one allowance for
loan losses by $306 million. We also recognized an allowance for credit losses of approximately $13 million
related to held to maturity debt security portfolio.
These adjustments were recorded as a decrease to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020 net of income taxes,
except for approximately $17 million related to purchase credit impaired or PCI loans previously accounted for
under SOP.
As advanced in our last webcast, as part of the adoption of CECL, the corporation made the election to break the
existing pools of purchased credit impaired or PCI loans, which in accordance with the applicable accounting
guidance, were previously excluded from non-performing status. Once transitioned to the individual loan
measurement, these loans are no longer excluded from non-performing status, resulting in an increase of $283
million in NPLs as of January 1, 2020.
Let me remind you that this is a change in classification of these loans, not a change in payment or performance
risk. This reporting change does not in any way increase the credit risk contained in Popular's loan portfolio.
However, the accounting treatment of these loans did result in a higher reported NPL level. We plan to phase in
the effects of CECL on regulatory capital over a five-year period.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Before discussing the CECL impact and credit trends for the quarter, I
would like to take the opportunity to highlight changes that have occurred in Popular credit risk profile since the
last global financial crisis, which you can see on slide number 9.
Although one might be tempted to view Popular in terms of the last crisis, the reality is that we are a much
different company with a stronger balance sheet and better risk profile. In the US, we stopped subprime lending in
2008 and today have limited subprime exposure in our consumer and mortgage business.
Our US bank is now a community and niche lender with a lower risk profile. In Puerto Rico, since 2007, our
commercial and construction exposure have decreased from 55% of our total loan book to 37%. During the same
timeframe, construction lending has decreased by 86% and now stands at $164 million.
On the bottom half of the slide, we also present the Puerto Rico commercial portfolio and include a net charge-off
distribution by segment since 2008. The important message from the table is our commercial mix has significantly
improved by reducing exposure to asset classes with historically high losses.
In the consumer portfolio, we have focused on two areas, mortgage and auto lending, thereby increasing the
percentage of collateralized consumer loans. We believe Popular is well-positioned to operate successfully during
diverse economic environments, given our improved risk profile and changes in our portfolio mix.
Turning to page number 10, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our entire loan
portfolio. However, we believe that certain portfolio segments are more sensitive and are highlighted on this slide.
Within non-essential retail, the charter in place always has curtailed activity of this segment. An important part of
our shopping center portfolio in both regions are owned by long-term customer with financially strong principles
that can withstand short-term disruptions in cash flow.
In terms of the auto retail in Puerto Rico, this activity was deemed non-essential under the Governor's lockdown
order and sales have decreased significantly. Popular has had historically low losses in the dealer segment even
during prolonged periods of decreased industry sales, given the collateralized nature of these loans. While we
expect a significant level of deferred requests, once auto dealers are allowed to reopen, we expect a gradual
increase in demand.
In the healthcare facility segment, the story differs by geography. Our Puerto Rico exposure is to hospitals where
restrictions on non-essential procedures have impacted admission levels and cash flows. Hospitals are eligible for
PPT loans and other federal programs over investments of healthcare related expenses or loss revenues not
otherwise reimbursed. We expect this segment to quickly rebound once restrictions are lifted. To-date, there have
been low levels of deferment requests.
In the US, our exposure is mainly to skilled nursing facilities. This segment is a key component of the post-acute
care that will continue to experience high demand due to demographic trends and the structure of the US
healthcare system. Several federal and local government funding programs are expected to be available through
the hospital relief fund included in the CARES Act. The majority of our customers are strong regional operators
with significant global cash flows. Our largest customers have substantial liquidity at Popular Bank.
In terms of the construction segment, most of our exposure is in the US and principally in the New York metro
region. The majority of our projects are in the late stage of completion, have low loan to costs and nominal
exposure to [ph] offer (26:50) and residential. Overall principals have liquidity and have historically injected capital
as necessary. To date, we have received a limited number of deferred requests in this portfolio.

Within the hospitality portfolio, which includes restaurants and hotels, we are closely monitoring our hotel
exposure. Hotel balances [ph] $280 million (27:15) at quarter end, mostly in Puerto Rico. This segment has
experienced elevated levels of stress due to travel restrictions that have reduced occupancy rates. Although the
speed of recovery is uncertain, we believe that our business focus will serve us well as we expect business
travelers will be the first to recover.
We have received a considerable number of payment deferral requests from borrowers in this segment.
Restaurant balances were $350 million at quarter end. This segment has experienced stress driven by the shelter
in place orders. The majority of our restaurant borrowers, particularly quick service or fast food, have continued to
operate through delivery and carryout.
Once the economy starts to reopen, we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace, especially the quick
service restaurants. We do not have [ph] material carrier (28:19) exposure to oil, aviation, or [indiscernible]
(28:23) national credits.
Please turn to page number 11 to discuss credit metrics. Non-performing assets increased by $253 million to
$903 million this quarter, mainly driven by non-performing loan increase of $241 million. The increase in NPL is
driven by Puerto Rico, mainly due to loans previously accounted for as purchased credit impaired. This portion of
our changing NPLs does not in any way increase our credit risk.
Upon being measured at the individual loan level, these loans are no longer excluded from non-performing status,
resulting in an increase of $278 million in NPL as of January 1, 2020. This increase included $144 million in loans
earlier over 90 days past due, and $134 million in loans that are not delinquent in their payment terms, but are
reported as non-performing due to other credit quality considerations.
Excluding this impact, NPLs decreased by $23 million mostly related to lower mortgage NPLs. In the US, NPL
increased by $4 million due to the transition to purchase credit deteriorated loans of the taxi medallion portfolio. At
the end of the quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 2.8% compared to 1.9% in the fourth
quarter of 2019.
Please turn to slid number 12 to discuss NPL interest. Excluding the purchase credit deteriorated loans transition,
NPL inflows increased by $10 million on a linked quarter basis, driven by repurchased mortgage loans. In the US,
inflows of NPLs were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to slide number 13, net charge-offs amounted to $63 million or annualized 91 basis points of average
loans held-in-portfolio related to net charge-off taken in the previous quarter in our taxi medallion portfolio,
reflecting agreements reached with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers. The corporation allowance for
credit losses increased by $442 million from the prior quarter to $920 million, driven by the day one impact of the
CECL adoption, coupled with changes in the macroeconomic condition from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We provide further details of the day one and day two impacts on the following slide. The ratio of allowance for
credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 3.3% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 1.7% in the previous
quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 120% compared to 91% in the
previous quarter. The provision for credit losses increased by $142 million from the prior quarter, mainly driven by
the COVID-19 impact on the macroeconomic scenarios. The provision to net charge off ratio was 302% in the first
quarter of 2020.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Please turn to slide number 14 to discuss details on the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses
under CECL. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Since implementation, our allowance for credit losses
related to loan has increased by $442 million or 93% driven by the day one adoption impact changes to the
economic scenarios and loan portfolio growth.
The day one adoption impact resulted in an increase of $350 million in the ACL. The day one impact was mainly
driven by increases in the following Puerto Rico loan portfolios; consumer by $122 million, mortgage by $86
million, and commercial by $62 million.
The economic scenario utilized was based on the March 27 Moody's Analytics S3 downside scenario. This
scenario assumes a double dip recession starting in the second quarter of 2020. The US stimulus plan enables
GDP growth in the third quarter, but the economy declines again in the fourth quarter, and it's not until the second
quarter of 2021 that a sustained recovery begins.
Under this scenario, unemployment peaks in the second quarter with rates of 13% in the US and 13.5% in Puerto
Rico. Economic activity in the second quarter declines by 25% in the US and 18% in Puerto Rico. This scenario
causes the allowances for credit losses to increase by $134 million driven by increases in Puerto Rico consumer
and US commercial.
To summarize, the adoption of CECL mythology and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant
changes in certain credit metrics, particularly the level of NPLs, the allowance and provision for credit losses and
related ratios, and early delinquency indicators as we stopped collection efforts in the second half of March.
The effects of the COVID-19 crisis continue to evolve, and the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain.
The improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of our loan portfolio positions Popular to successfully
operate under the challenging environments. We will continue to carefully review the exposure to coronavirus
related risk, changes in the economic outlook and the effect on credit quality.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your update. To summarize, our results for the quarter were impacted by a large
increase in our provision expense reflecting the newly adopted CECL methodology and the most recent post-
COVID-19 macroeconomic forecast for Puerto Rico and the US.
However, our operating results for the first quarter were solid, given the extent of the economic acceleration
experienced during the second half of March. The COVID-19 global pandemic has exposed the fragility of our
economic and social system and the need for greater collaboration between all sectors.
I am hopeful that it will also reveal what can we accomplish when we work together in pursuit of a common goal.
At Popular, the well-being of our customers, employees, and communities is our priority. We have acted
decisively to help our employees stay safe while we continue to offer essential banking services to our customers
and communities.
During our 126 years, we have often operated in highly uncertain and volatile economic periods and have always
managed through them successfully. Almost three years ago, we faced the impacts of Hurricane Maria which

[indiscernible] (35:44) in many cases for months. We responded decisively, adapted to change and delivered
favorable results even under these very difficult conditions.
While each situation presents unique challenges, we haven't seen the experience and the financial resources to
do so again, and I am optimistic about the future of our company. Despite the uncertainty we are all facing as we
fight this pandemic, we are confident that with our strong liquidity position and capital levels, we are well-prepared
to successfully manage for the current challenges.

First off, just talking about the CECL provision here and kind of the assumptions and really appreciate that you
laid everything out here on slide 14, but as I look at this [indiscernible] (37:07) former DFAST assumptions from a
couple of years ago, can you talk about the differences in the assumptions for DFAST that would cause the
reserve or the charge-offs to go that much higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I'll take that. I think whenever you look at the construct of DFAST scenarios, it's more – I'd say more of an
elongated U type of recovery. So, we have an impact of economic downturn for about four or five quarters and
then you start the road to recovery.
And these have to be measured, the losses associated with a specified period while the CECL obviously is
lifetime losses, will that certainly create a difference between [ph] what you compute (37:58) versus DFAST, but I
think the other aspect that is different is the economic scenario in which the – usually the DFAST is elongated U,
the scenario that would model today is more – is sort of like a W with the recovery starting in...

Exhibit on the [ph] statutory (38:16) to be much more elongated in more of a U versus what you have modeled.
So, it's the length of the downturn more than anything else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I don't think that was partly. Obviously there has been significant changes in the credit composition and credit
quality of our portfolios. So, those are the other things that also impact those comparisons.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then sort of the way that – the 2 million shares in the second quarter and then is there
an adjustment to equity as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No, I think that the – exactly the shares we're going to receive will depend on the execution of the termination
agreement, Alex. I mean the best way to think about it is that when the ASI was terminated, the initial – number of
shares that were delivered to us that part of it is sort of closed out.
And then the contract itself requires that a settlement process that is also in shares and that is what is ongoing
now. The first delivery of [indiscernible] (39:31) shares will benefit from a discount on the original contract, the
additional purchases don't. But I think the two – the main – the more important change here is that – this program
which we expected to end late this year will actually end in the second quarter. So the full effect of the ASR will be
done in the second quarter as opposed to the third discounted for already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Which will give you the full year's benefit of the program...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...because it will not be an adjustment in equity? Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Correct. Under the original contract, that reduction – that last reduction of shares would have happened late in the
year, and now it's going to happen in the second quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Well, that's great. And then, just final question for me and maybe this one is a little bit more forward thinking, but
one thing that's always struck me when I go down to Puerto Rico is just how unbelievably crowded the bank
branches are, and especially when you compare them to branches in New York City, for example.
Does the ongoing crisis right now, does it cause you to rethink or give you any indications that the way the
banking could change on a more sort of permanent basis down there, and kind of help you rethink the way that
you are allocating expenses over the next year and into 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, I'm not sure over the next year – this is Ignacio – I mean, everything – this pandemic will cause us to rethink
almost everything. But definitely we're going to be looking at it. But one thing people forget, there are less
branches per inhabitant in Puerto Rico than there are in the US. So we're not over-branched as an industry.
That's one thing.
The transaction levels have remained high. Now people – this pandemic has led to more digital transactions,
whether that will be a permanent change I don't know, but you don't see lines in our branches anymore, but you
do see lines in our drive through. So there're still a lot of people transacting physically.
Another thing I want to add is that as opposed to some of our markets like New York and South Florida, the cost
of operating branches in Puerto Rico is not huge. Our rental expense, our community expense for branches is
relatively small. The biggest expense is the employees, but with trend toward digital, we'll see how that plays out.

Operator: Next question comes from Mark Palmer of BTIG. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Palmer Q
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Yes. Thanks very much for taking my question. First of all, with regard to the deferred payments, just wanted to
ask about the mechanics of how that would work once we get back to a resumption of payments as it pertains to
the overall loan balance? Will the deferred payments essentially be tacked on to the end of the loan such that the
maturity schedule will be pushed back, or is there some other approach that would be taken?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
That's generally how it's going to work for our mortgage products. For some of the other consumer products, the
mortgage products has pre-computed interest, so we just move into the auto loans although at the end they have
simple interest. So the mechanics are a bit different in each product. But yes for mortgage, it is just tacked at the
end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Palmer Q
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Okay. Thank you. And with regard to the company's provision for loan losses, how should we think about how that
could evolve in the second quarter and beyond?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes. It's complex to comment about the provision looking forward, because we have to run the models and we
don't even know what the inputs on economic centers are going to be by the end of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
So, a lot of uncertainty, and obviously this is different than some of the other economic crisis we faced. I mean
some of the models are going to be dependent on the health outcomes, right. As you saw earlier today,
development to the health can move the markets, can move economic forecast. So, we'll have to see what
happens, how successfully economies open up or don't open up, whether the ones that open up faster have
problems. So, there's a lot of question marks that are...

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you for the detail by the way, always very, very helpful. And on slide 10, looking at the sensitive segments
to COVID-19 and you listed the deferrals, can you – from your experience with the hurricanes that you've been
through in the past and the deferral programs you've used in those time periods, what percentage of deferrals
actually go back to accruing versus generally speaking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I mean I will tell you based on our experience with Maria, generally most of our clients continue to accrue it. So,
we did not have a negative experience to the deferment to the contrary. It was very...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I know you guys have discussed on the call what the current conditions are in terms of the lockdowns and
stuff, and I apologize if you addressed this, I had to jump off the call. What outlook is instructions will be lifted, if
there is an outlook for that at this time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yes, it's a bit uncertain. The Governor of Puerto Rico is receiving input both from a medical taskforce and an
economic taskforce. As you can imagine, their perspective is a little bit different. The medical taskforce being
more conservative on what they're recommending and the economic taskforce being little more open.
We are expecting her to say something I think by tomorrow, Saturday at the latest because the current lockdown
expires on Sunday. So, I think there will be a gradual opening, more gradual than in some of the other
jurisdictions, for example, because our lockdown has been more severe than other jurisdictions.
Most jurisdictions for example banking and essential services exempted or she has limited some of the things
even banks can do, as we've mentioned in the call, mortgage and auto loans are basically suspended.
So I would anticipate it will open up somewhat probably with construction maybe some professional services. But
she's going to take it I think in more gradual than some of the other state governments.
And as you know we've been have – so far we've had a pretty successful story in Puerto Rico in terms of the
number of deaths have been relatively low. Our hospitals are not overwhelmed and in fact we have the opposite
problem. The census in many of our hospitals is very low. So I can't complain about that.
Obviously, we all want the economy to open, but we don't want to be in a situation we have a big second wave
and have people open to close again. So, I think we'll begin to open but I think it'll be more gradual than some of
the other US jurisdictions that you've seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just lastly, on your economic scenarios on the slide 14, once again thank you for the detail,
the Q-to-Q declined in the United States real GDP, I'm presuming that second quarter 2020 versus 2020, do you
guys have what the estimate was that you used for the full year 2020 decline versus 2019?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Just on your kind of W forecast and I apologize for kind of hitting this third time I've kind of asked this
question, but have the scenarios worsened from Moody's since the March 27? I mean you're using kind of a
different one I think than realized, is that forecast too much since the end of March?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I haven't really looked at the recent scenarios by Moody's. The difference – I mean most of our peers I think use
the baseline with our base on a benchmark analysis that the downsize scenario, the S3 was more reflective of the
reality and that's the one we use as of quarter end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yes, I would agree with that too. The other question I had was on the deferrals, what's the process here for – and
to the extent that these – that you are continued to be locked down for a while, how long can these deferrals go
out before you start to have to recognize them as underperforming loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President & Chief Executive Officer, Popular, Inc.
That's a difficult accounting question. But normally, if look at the mortgage loans, we do have the CARES Act,
which sets the standard basically that under law any federally supported guaranteed loan we have to give a six-
month deferral, and if the client asked for an additional six months.
In Puerto Rico they've adopted a law for most of the other consumer products that requires up to four months. I
think within the terms of those limits, we should be okay from non-accrual. Those are statutory mandated across
the board requirements. Other than that, it becomes more of a case by case analysis of the present value of the
payments, how much it's impacted and – but within those statutory limits, I think we'll be okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.
