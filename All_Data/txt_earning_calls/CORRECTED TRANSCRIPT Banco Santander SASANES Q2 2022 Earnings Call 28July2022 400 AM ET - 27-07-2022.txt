Thank you, Begoña. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. So, well, I should start
saying that the second quarter, we've been living in a period in which we saw inflation hitting decade-high levels,
interest rates going up [ph] and start to raise (00:01:02) and significant concerns regarding [ph] lower (00:01:05)
economic activity in the future. So, this is to sum up a little bit the environment of the last quarter.

In this environment, we continue to grow our business, our customer base, and [indiscernible] (00:01:16) into a
growth in the loans and deposits and revenues in our P&L, NII plus fees, as you can see in the slide. So, on the
progress in the digital front have been significant in the quarter.
When we talk about profitability, second quarter profit was €2.4 billion for – reaching for the first half is €4.9 billion,
33% higher than the previous year. If we look in the constant euros is 21% higher than the previous year. The
cost in a highly inflationary environment remain well below inflation, and our efficiency ratio stood at 45.5% in line
to reach our end of the year target of 45%. We improved our profitability ratios. The return on tangible equity stays
at 13.7%, and we continue to create significant value for our shareholders. EPS grew 38% compared to the
previous year, and tangible net asset value per share plus cash dividend per share grew 9% year-on-year.
In regard with this trend, the quality of the balance sheet NPLs continue to trend down. The cost of risk remain
well inside our expected range. And our capital is slightly above 12%, the core equity tier 1, following a strong net
organic generation of 18 basis points in the second quarter.
As I have just mentioned in our commercial strategy, while reflecting widespread growth, as you can see in the
slide, we've been growing in individuals both in mortgages and consumer and others in mid to high-single digit,
less so in the corporate space where we are seeing relatively flattish loan book in SMEs and corporates, while
corporate investment banks growing at 13%. So, overall, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, €21 billion in the
quarter, which increases in all countries, mainly from mortgages and consumers, as I said.
So, in summary, I think we have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio by market, and our CFO, José, will
explain later on in more detail the portfolio by geography, some by collateral. On the other hand, the deposits
grew 1% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year with a market shift towards time deposits due to the new
interest rate environment.
Turning to the income statement, well, let me just give you a brief overview of the main ideas. The performance in
euros was better than in the currencies due to the depreciation of euros, although we have a negative, partially
was offset by the hedging included in the Corporate Centre. This is including gains on financial transactions. In
constant euros, talking in constant euros, [ph] goodwill (00:04:31) revenue 4% year-on-year at a faster pace than
in Q1 on the back of higher volumes, interest rate hikes starting to feed through in some countries, together with
another strong quarter in CIB. Cost management face inflationary pressures, but continue to grow well below
inflation. This allowed us to achieve record pre-provision profit of €14 billion in the first half of this year.
As for loan loss provisions, the release recorded in the UK and US in second quarter 2021 affected the year-on-
year comparison. Finally, we had a positive impact from minority interest [ph] following buybacks (00:05:11) in
Mexico and the US, and lower tax [ph] but (00:05:14) mainly in Brazil due to the recovery from tax contingencies
and others. This led to a record first half profit of €4.9 billion in 2022. A cumulative underlying profit recorded the
same amount as we don't have extraordinary charges in this first half of the year.
If we look [indiscernible] (00:05:32) in Europe, we continue to accelerate our business transformation towards a
common operating model. These were reflected in our customer growth year-on-year increasing nearly by
300,000 in the quarter, double-digit growth in net operating income and profit. Return on tangible equity improved
to 8.8%.
In North America, we are refocusing our position in the US while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation. We
accelerated growth volumes. Loans grew 7% in most segments in Mexico and in auto and CIB in the US. We also
increased our customer base 3% year-on-year. Lastly, we achieved a profit of €1.6 billion in the region.

South America, we are leaders in the region with a unique presence strengthened by the group assets and
delivering profitable growth. Our growth strategy based on increasing customers, 6 million year-on-year and
capturing new business opportunities led to a sharp increase in volumes. Loans grew 12% and deposits 5%. First
half underlying profit over €1.9 billion, 7% year-on-year and higher return on tangible equity staying above 20%.
In Digital Consumer Bank, we continued to strengthen our leadership position as reflected in new lending. We
rose by 10% in [ph] a shrinking market (00:06:58). Profit rose to double-digits and return on tangible equity
increased to 12%.
If we look at performance metrics, efficiency ratio, I already elaborate on this. We are running at 45.5% now
heading towards our target of 45% for the year-end. Return on tangible equity, we are slightly ahead of our target
for the whole year, 13.7%. And we are on track now to meet our 2022 target.
In terms of EPS, €0.27 in the quarter, 38% year-on-year, 19% versus first half of 2021 in underlying earnings per
share. And we are showing sustained earnings per share growth, mainly if we take into account that we amortized
almost 550 million shares through the buybacks, that is approximately slightly above 3%, 3.2% of our capital. The
tangible net asset value per share was for €4.24, including cash and dividends. It was in line with the previous
quarter and 9% higher year-on-year.
When it comes to capital, the organic capital generation was in line with our expectations, net organic, 18 basis
points, if we take into account the payout, 40% [ph] half in cash dividend and half in buyback (00:08:33). We are
generating roughly speaking 10% after taking into consideration the buyback that is in line with our expectations
10% per quarter. And this quarter is not show up in the total capital raised due to the fact that the held to collect
and [ph] sell (00:08:49) mark-to-market and detract 13 basis points on our capital, and this offset the growth in the
organic generation.
So, we are meeting [indiscernible] (00:09:01) growth below loan growth. And we showed that this is one of our
targets, better profitability in the front book and reducing the weight of risk-weighted assets that [indiscernible]
(00:09:14) producing a return on equity below the cost of equity. We are progressing well on those targets and
this is show in our profitability.
Finally, before I hand to José, I would like to highlight Santander's strong commitments in ESG. Mainly, I want to
refer to the new targets we published just a couple of weeks ago on top of the already existing targets in relation
with power generation and coal. We published specific targets for energy, aviation and steel and used the
absolute level of emissions in the region of 30% for the relevant period from 2019 to 2030.
Well, you have the figures and we are provisioning green finance, and we appointed a new head of green finance
in order to first to measure properly, to classify properly according to European taxonomy our loan book, and to
generate a business and help our customer to a greener economy for our customers.
Well, as you know, we are very active in the social problem, particularly in Latin America, with financially
empowered people. You have the figures in the presentation. Overall, I'm proud of the group progress on
delivering in our responsible banking commitments to help to tackle global challenges, both in the climate front
and in the social front.
I will now hand to José that elaborate on the group and business area review. And finally, I will do some final
remarks.

[audio gap] (00:10:52) just provided a brief overview of the main highlights for the quarter, and I will go into more
detail about the P&L of the group and the progress of the country and business areas. In the quarter, we earned
€2.4 billion after recording regulatory charges of nearly €500 million, €400 million for the Resolution Fund, and
€88 million contribution to the new institutional protection scheme in Poland.
In the first half, total income exceeded €25 billion. Both NII and fee income grew at 7% in constant euros and
accounted for 97% of total income. Trading gains and other income decreased 40% compared to last year, mostly
affected by FX hedging, which detracted €300 million and also from lower lease income ALCO portfolio sales in
2021 higher regulatory contributions. In the quarterly performance, we saw similar trends, revenue up 4%
excluding regulatory charges.
Let me take a moment to go through the main drivers of NII in more detail. Group NII was up supported by a
broad-based growth in loans and deposits, coupled with margin management and interest rate hikes in UK and
Poland. As a result, net interest income and net interest margin increased from 2.38% last year to 2.49% in the
first half of this year. You have all the information on the slide, but I would like to highlight the following by country.
We had very strong NII in the UK and Poland, as I mentioned, because these are the two countries where we see
the impact of higher rates in Europe. We also had robust activity in both countries. Spain and Poland, we
decreased NII by 6% and 8%, respectively, despite the rising volumes due to the continued pressure on yields
and lower ALCO portfolios. In the US, NII was affected by the Bluestem portfolio disposal and consumer loan
pricing competition. Mexico NII up 9%, due to strong loan growth in individuals and corporates. And finally, in
Brazil, NII rose 2% but by volume growth and credit mix, which was particularly offset by negative sensitivity to
initial rate hikes. We expect this negative impact from liability repricing to level out in the fourth quarter of this year
and turn positive into next year.
Regarding fees, we had very positive performance in all regions, supported by greater activity in high value-added
products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. All countries increased the income with
exception of the UK, which was affected by the transfer of the CIB business to the London branch. It would've
been flattish, excluding this impact and, in the US, affected by the Bluestem disposal and lower overdraft fees.
In terms of cost, we kept our target of growing cost below inflation, while improving the efficiency. In Europe, of
course, we're down 7% in real terms, with widespread falls across countries and the efficiency here improved 4
percentage points. In summary, we continue to make structural changes to our operating model to drive new
productivity improvements in the future.
Turning to risk. The group maintained positive credit quality ratios. The NPL ratio was 3.05%, 21 basis points
better than in the previous quarter and most markets improved. In Spain, it fell 64 basis points due to portfolio
sales. Total loan loss reserves stood at €24 billion and the loan loss coverage at 71%, up 2 percentage points in
the quarter. The distribution of the loan portfolio by stages remained stable and even Stage 3 assets were lower
in the quarter. Our cost of credit stood at 83 basis points. This is last 12 months. If we look at the first six months
of the year, the cost of risk was 91 basis points, in line with our target for the year.
I would like to drill a little deeper into loan-loss provisions and cost of risk performance by country. In Europe, all
countries remain below 1% or were negative. In Spain, cost of risk improved due to lower loan-loss provisions and
better portfolio quality. UK and Portugal slightly positive considering only six months. In Poland, improved
provisions, BAU provisions, but cost of risk was affected by the contribution to the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
The US cost of risk below 1%. After the 2021 releases, loan-loss provisions are up year-on-year, but are still well
below pre-pandemic levels. In Mexico, cost of risk improved slightly – I mean significantly, thanks to a better-than-
expected performance of the loan portfolio. In Brazil, the cost of risk increased primarily in unsecured individuals,
which represents around 20% of the portfolio. Secure individuals, SMEs and corporates, which represent 80% of
the total portfolio, were stable.
The coverage ratio over [ph] 90 days (00:16:31) is well above pre-pandemic levels. We are better positioned than
in the previous crisis as we increased the individual secured portfolio, we have less volatility than the market, and
cheque especial decreased its weight compared to previous crisis. In Digital Consumer, cost of risk improved and
continued to show outstanding low levels considering the nature of the business.
Finally, I would like to show you a brief overview of our loan portfolio. It's more concentrated in mature markets,
around 80%. In developing markets, Brazil accounts for just 9% of the group total and 65% of the total portfolio is
secured, mostly by real estate collateral. By segment, mortgages with loan to values below 80% account for 90%
of the total. The consumer lending portfolio is very well-collateralized and is a very short time duration. SMEs and
corporates is covered with 50% real guarantees. And lastly, 65% of our corporate portfolio, large corporate
portfolio is rated investment grade and 42% is rated above A-, a very good quality portfolio.
Let me now make some brief comments about the evolution of our main units in 2022. In Spain, year-on-year
results were driven by lower costs, 4% and reduced cost of risk in an environment of weak revenue performance.
Looking forward, we expect trends to continue for the second half. NII should absorb the impact of TLTRO
cancellations. But in 2023, we expect to reflect asset re-pricing delivering margin expansion. Fee income should
remain robust in the second half. Costs should maintain its downward trend pointing to achievement of our cost-
to-income target, and cost of risk is expected to remain around 55 basis points to 60 basis points for the year.
In the UK, we also maintain very positive dynamics in new lending and a strong NII. Looking forward, we expect
these trends to continue with NII growing well, although probably at lower rates than until today, flat costs and
cost of risk normalization, close to around 10 basis points.
In the United States, 2022 results compare to high financials in 2021. Nevertheless, in the first half, profit
remained very, very high above €1 billion. Our outlook for 2022 is lower revenue, impacted by lease businesses.
Cost is slightly up, partially due to the incorporation of Amherst Pierpont and better than initially anticipated cost of
risk, well below normalized levels.
Santander Mexico had another excellent quarter. For the year as a whole, we expect higher NII and fees, cost up,
impacted by investments in digitalization and higher inflation, and cost of risk below 2.5%, supporting a credit
quality that is better than average.
In Brazil, in the first half, where we have a negative impact due to our balance sheet's initial negative sensitivity to
higher rates, higher inflation that is putting pressure on cost, and the cost of risk that deteriorated in unsecured
loans to individuals, we earned a 21.5% return on tangible equity. We expect to end 2022 maintaining efficiency
around 30% and cost of risk below 4% to 4.5%, which will result in a return on equity around 20%. All in all, in a
difficult year, we expect a strong set of results and profitability. And we are optimistic for 2023 when we expect to
see an improvement in revenue.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, new business activity increased 10% year-on-year. We gained market share
particularly in used cars. Looking forward to the second half, the environment will continue to be challenging, but
6

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
we are confident in meeting our goals and expect a record year in new business exceeding the previous record of
€49 billion in 2019. We expect some normalization from the current low cost of risk rate, but should remain well
below previous normalized levels because in this case, cost of risk has to do more with unemployment than with
interest rates and we expect a strong labor market in Europe in general in the coming years.
CIB delivered another very strong excellent quarter. In the coming quarters, we expect to continue to gain market
share, increasing revenue through excellent dynamics in structured finance and project finance, transaction
volumes, and markets where we are protecting the value of our trading books. Wealth Management & Insurance,
despite market volatility results, grew 15%.
In Private Banking, we had a new net money inflows of €6 billion. In Asset Management, profits rose 8%. And in
Insurance, gross written premiums grows 17%. Looking forward, we expect to maintain double-digit growth in
profit contribution across the three businesses.
In PagoNxt, total revenue in the first half surged 87% year-on-year on the back of our four main business
segments, especially merchants and trade. Activities have all been very well, and we believe we will meet our
plus 50% revenue target for the whole year. Finally, in Cards, we managed 96 million cards throughout the group
and revenue grew 28% year-on-year to circa €2 billion, but with double-digit growth in America and Europe. We
expect to continue to grow turnover and revenue at high-double digits in the coming months.
Let me now turn it back to José Antonio for his closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. Allow me to try to guide you to take a look forward how do we see the group evolving in the
coming quarters.
So, on one side – on the revenue side, we have a environment in which NII should increase in the coming
quarters, benefiting mainly from interest rate hikes. Normal interest rate hikes take for a while to show up in the
P&L. It starts accelerate later on. And with respect to activity levels, we expect a significant acceleration of the
revenues, particularly in 2023. You will see some of these. We are already seeing some of these clearly in Poland
and UK, where rates set to go up faster and we will see next year basically a strong acceleration, significant
acceleration on the back of high rates in Europe and also in Mexico and in other countries.
So, fee income, José mentioned how our fee income generating business are evolving. You saw both Wealth
Management & Insurance and CIB that are the main fee income generators. We are gaining share clearly in the
CIB space. That is performing very well and we are also doing very well in Private Banking and Insurance, where
we think that we can grow Wealth Management & Insurance well into double digits. So, for that reason, I am
relatively optimistic about the commercial activity fee income generate – that generates fee income.
So, positive on revenues and costs, while we face clearly a higher inflation [ph] not the one (24:41) we were
expecting, but while we have a track record and we continue to think that we're going to be able to increase the
productivity and to evolve really the cost well below the inflation as we are doing quarter after quarter, naturally,
some of the inflation is going to go through the cost base, particularly in those countries with high inflation. But we
feel that the productivity gains and cost management will allow us – cost grow well below inflation.
In asset quality, a decent margin. As you know, [indiscernible] (25:16) probably some numbers yesterday or the
day before yesterday, I don't remember exactly, and where there's an erosion of the expectations on the GDP.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
And natural in this environment, the discussion is if there is a recession coming or not. Some of these credit
quality duration, as you know, IFRS 9 require us to anticipate potential deterioration. In the first half of the year,
we already done in our provisions some of these, around €600 million or something like that, for deterioration. But
we see our – given our loan portfolio structure, the high household saving rates, the low unemployment rates and
the resilient real estate prices as our protection in our portfolio, for this year, we feel comfortable that we're going
to be inside our range that we gave to you, less than 1%. We are running up 91 basis points and we feel
comfortable with our target for the year.
In capital, our commitment is to stay at or above 12% in every quarter and having disciplined capital allocation
and – well, reflect this in the higher profitability. So, we are there and the capital generation of the group, other
than the mark-to-market of held to collect and sales has been good in the quarter. And my impression is that
continue to be good and will continue generating capital on a continuous basis. And this will translate into our
shareholders, where our commitment is to have a 40% payout for this year, although we hope to increase closer
to 50% in the future once the – that is what we communicated to you in our shareholders' meeting.
So, well, just to reiterate our commitments for the year, both in terms of depreciation, return on tangible equity and
core equity Tier 1 , we feel comfortable, we feel that we can reach those targets this year. And for the future, I
think that the revenue increase will be more than – will offset the potential higher costs and potential increase on
cost of risks. So, I'm positive on the capacity of the group to regenerate profits in the future.
That's it. Now, we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We already have our first question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas,
Exane. Please go ahead.
Our next question is coming from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Hi. Good morning. Hopefully you can hear me. I've got two questions, one on Brazil and another clarification
on your last comments on capital. On Brazil, I heard José mentioned that you keep the 4% to 4.5% cost of risk.
But if I look at Q2 stand-alone cost of risk, I think it's 525 basis points. And it looks like to achieve your guidance
for the full year in the second half, you'd need to be below 400 basis points. So, I just want to make sure I've
understood the guidance correctly and maybe you can give a bit of color what's going on because it's probably a
steeper increase than we were expecting, although you had flagged that the peak will be in Q2, but maybe a bit of
color on what's going on and if I got those numbers right.
And the second question on capital, the 50% you mentioned, José Antonio, is that – can we expect that already in
2023? Or another way to ask it, is there anything we need to take into account that might prevent you from raising
it to 50%, i.e. remaining capital [indiscernible] (00:30:04). I think for 2023, you already said there isn't any left, but
I don't know if there's anything in the second half, conscious that Banamex is no longer on the table. So, I just
can't see any reason why you shouldn't increase it to 50%. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thanks, Alvaro, for your questions. On Brazil, well, José already elaborate on this, allow me to go in more
details. As José said, we are seeing a increase in cost of risk in the consumer mass market portfolio. You're right,
[ph] I said in (00:30:38) the second quarter was higher than in the first quarter. Having said that, we remain
comfortable with the guidance we gave to you. It's true that we saw already in June better results than we saw in
the third – in the three or four previous months. And we remain constructive and within that, we are in control of
these to remain in this range.
As you know, we reduced the lending last year. José already mentioned that our exposure to the most -the
overdraft that is the part of the higher cost of risk has been reduced. And we feel comfortable with our
expectations for the year, mainly taking into account that Brazil has been one of the few countries in which
expectations for GDP growth have been improved by the IMF, yeah? So, the situation in the country
[indiscernible] (00:31:35) we face selections by October. But in general, we see the situation for a more
constructive point of view. And we think that with the measures we took and with the trends we are seeing, we're
going to stick with this 4%, 4.5% cost of risk for the whole year.
We are not seeing any sign of deterioration other than the ones we saw before. So, we are seeing the corporate
book performing very well. We are seeing including SMEs, and is – remains related with the individual portfolio
consumer. And inside the consumer, auto portfolio improves already. It's more unsecured consumer that is still
causing this spike in the cost of risk.

And second question, well, it's true that we don't – or we said that we don't have headwinds going forward in our
capital. What I'm stating here is what we are stating at the AGM, the intention of the board to go to 50%. When is
this going to happen? Well, it's up to the board. I am not in a position to anticipate the decision that is going to be
taken by the board. But this is the clear intention of the group, is to go back to these levels and continue to use
the buybacks and the combination of buybacks and cash dividend as we done in the last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
If I may give you a bit of color about the regulatory charges in the second half. In the first half, we had 5 basis
points in the first quarter. The plus 3 basis points in the second quarter has two components. It's plus 7 basis
points from the non-performing loan, but still a difference, and minus 4 basis points from models. So, from pure
regulatory, we have an around 9 basis points, 10 basis points already accounted for and we would expect another
10 basis points, 15 basis points in the second half. So, very much in line with the guidance we gave you at the
beginning of the year for 20 basis points or 25 basis points total regulatory charges in the year as a whole.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Sorry for the problem before. Just have one follow-up question on Mexico. Just
following the sort of like the outcome of Banamex, what is the strategy plan to follow there and what are the
priorities for the bank in terms of organic growth in which [indiscernible] (00:34:19) that you can gain market
share?
And the other question is on cost of risk at a group level. I mean, you have given a bit of a comfort about Brazil.
But, I mean, is there sort of like any other market where you think that they could be sort of like – would you
envisage some deterioration that could put a risk, that below 100 basis points cost of risk guidance for 2022?
Thank you.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Ignacio, for your question. In Mexico, [indiscernible] (00:34:55) – well, as you rightly said and
we communicated to the market [indiscernible] (00:34:59) organic growth. When we look at our franchise in
Mexico, we have overall 13%, 14% market share in upscale to compete efficiently in our market, and no doubt
about this. When you look in more detail where we're going to focus, we're going to focus more on individuals. So,
when you look at the market shares all across, it's true that we – our market share in the corporate space is
higher than it is in the individual space, particularly on the – for the division, the organic growth, it's going to be
focusing growing the customer base, individual, but it should split through – in the balance sheet through a larger
deposit base, individual's deposit base, I mean, and through a larger share, particularly on the consumer.
We are growing in auto, we started three years ago. We've got already 14% market share, and we're going to
continue to grow in the consumer space, but also in credit cards, where we launched in September last year a
new card that is selling 100,000 cards a month. And we are growing well there and we expect the growth to
accelerate – it's accelerating, if you look at the numbers at the balance sheet that the P&L is accelerating, and we
continue – we expect to continue to this acceleration. So, in short, we're going to focus more on the individual
side, where we need to grow the deposit base and also in the consumer finance space and credit cards.
In mortgage market, our market share is around 18%, 19%, where we're up of our average market. We are doing
well there. But those are going to be the focus. If you remember here a little bit the situation we faced in Brazil a
couple of years ago, when Bradesco bought HSBC, and on the back of these, we were able to gain 2 or 3
percentage point market share in Brazil in a very difficult time in Brazil at that time. Brazil was in recession at that
time, and we were able to profit from this situation, and we expect – we are doing already on the back of the
process now and we expect to continue to do in the coming years.
Second question, cost of risk, more general question, not that much focused in Brazil as your colleague, Alvaro, I
already elaborated on Brazil. You mentioned other markets, other markets. The cost of risk is going up in Brazil
for the situation I explained, and is going up also in the US. It's back to normal in the US. Yeah? In the US, in
2021, the cost of risk was abnormally low, well below expected across the cycle, and we are in some kind of
normalization. It's going according with our plans. Well, you know that the cost of risk largely depends on the auto
market. And the auto market remains in a situation that is not – I don't know how to qualify – not normal in the
sense that the availability of new cars is not there, and the used car prices remain at the all-time highs, I think.
And this situation creates a market where the cost of risk is still up. Unemployment is very low, well – and inflation
helps to pay the bills in the short run. And this will get the – for the time being, the normalization is going to
happen little by little in the US, but this is the other marketing when you go to the numbers, you see the cost of
risk going up.
In all the other markets, I don't see any sign of deterioration. Quite the opposite. In Spain, we are trending down.
We expect to continue to go down this year and next year. In consumer, we are not seeing any sign across the
board. I'm referring now to consumers in Europe. In Mexico, we feel very comfortable with the portfolio. In Chile,
we also feel very comfortable with the portfolio. So, I don't see any deterioration in the portfolios. And in fact,
NPLs are trending down, remember that the NPLs now around 3%, taking into account that there is a changing
criteria within the definition. Before like-for-like, we are – compared with last year, these periods are around 280-,
280-something. So – and still trending down, we are not seeing signs of deterioration there.
Well, maybe I should elaborate because I mentioned in the previous quarters around eco loans. Remember that
in the previous quarter, we were discussing uncertainties around the eco loans with extension we did last year, for
11

one year. Those loans matured, start to pay normal installments in April-May. And I should say that, it came – I
should say, significantly, much better than expected. So, initial areas were below 3% and this is significantly
better than, at least, my expectations, yeah, and the uncertainty what I was showing you.
So, that's the situation. Our models have high sensitivity. As you know, we provide or based it on IFRS – and the
models apply in IFRS rule 9. Rules, I mentioned that provisions in the first half €600 million were due to market
conditions, the changing – to picking the new macro conditions for the future. And these were mainly in Spain like
€100 million due to market conditions. In UK like €200 million, €250 million and the US, €130 million. So, those
are provisions that are there due to change in the market conditions, not reflecting any kind of deterioration in the
portfolio. I think I expect to clarify a little bit with the issue of the cost of risk.

Operator: The next question is coming from Pamela Zuluaga from Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pamela Zuluaga Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is again around capital. So, most of the organic
capital that you keep on generating has been offset by fair valuation adjustments from your bond portfolios. Are
you thinking about maybe changing your risk allocation strategy, shifting your accounting towards held to maturity
for bonds in order to somehow shield capital better? How should we think about this risk moving forward?
Because thinking about the pending regulatory impacts that you were guiding for, could we therefore expect some
further risks to capital if market dynamics continue weighing on valuations?
And then, the second question is on Poland. Do you have any estimates on the potential impact from mortgage
moratoria in Poland because we already have confirmation that four of those months are going to happen this
year and four next year? And then, should we continue to expect further provisioning in Poland related to the FX-
denominated mortgages? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Pamela, for your questions. In capital organic, your question is related to held to collect and
sale. Well, what happens with this portfolio with – our portfolios are relatively short duration. So, the portfolios is in
the region of €50 billion. I think the duration, José probably you have, you can give the duration of the portfolio.
We are not – we took a chance on our capital of 25 basis points in the first half of the year due to the held to
collect and sell mark-to-market portfolio. We are not in a hurry to change this reclassification. We know that if we
reclassify, you get back 25 basis points but – while, at the same time, the duration is short and is going – as long
as – if the rates remain stable, it's feeding through the P&L, yeah, month-after-month and quarter-after-quarter
and we'll get [ph] review (00:43:14) significantly, rates remain as they are today. Naturally, if they go one way or
another, well, this affect the P&L. But we are not – we don't feel that we are not in a hurry given the size of the
portfolio and the duration to do something as you suggest. I don't know, José, if you want to comment on this.

Yeah. Just a little bit more detail on this. Of the €75 billion ALCO portfolio, €53 billion is held to collect and sale
and only €20 billion, €22 billion, €21.5 billion is held to collect. So, we have most of our portfolio in mark-to-
market. Of these, as José Antonio said, 75% has a duration of less than two years. So, for instance, in Poland is
one year, in Mexico is 1.7 years. So, very, very short time duration, 70% less than two years. So, the impact of
this potential further deterioration with this duration is going to be significantly less going forward than it has been
so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The second question is in Poland. If I understood you well, you're asking two questions. One is about
mortgage moratoria and the other one is a FX Swiss franc provision for mortgages. In relation with the first one,
what has been published recently and what we've done is, assuming 50% take up of all the portfolio, is going to
be an impact of PLN 1.3 billion. Yeah? So, that means in euros, I don't know, €200 million or 200-something.
They likely, they likely not. Once we have destinations, this is going to be charged in the third quarter in our P&L
in Poland. So, the figure is slightly below €300 million.
For FX, we are now at 32%, if I am right, coverage. Well, do we need to top up? We'll see. The market is around
35%. So, we are there, it's not going to be significant, but maybe that we need to top up, depending on how the
litigations go, how many customers go to courts and how many customers, we negotiate directly with them, a
potential compensation here. But I don't rule out to go to 8% to 36%, 35%, 37%. So, but in any case, it's 3% of a
portfolio of 1-9, €1.9 billion or something like that. So, in euros, it's like €50 million, €60 million. Yeah. I hope I
answered all your questions.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah, hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first one would be on the proposed
Spanish banking tax, do you have any additional comments that you can make, what the potential impact on you
will be and will it only be on your Spanish operations or also on your international operations?
And then, my second question would be a little bit a follow-up on the ALCO portfolio. Could you just remind us
how much ALCO bonds do you have in Spain and, kind of, over time where you [indiscernible] (00:47:01) ALCO
portfolio level 2. So, how much could you potentially increase that ALCO portfolio by?
And then, just a follow-up question on Mexico, can you just clarify why you walked away from the Banamex
transaction? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Spanish banking tax, unfortunately, I have no idea, yeah, at this moment – at this point of time. So, I was
told that the rumor in the media is that this morning, the same morning, we're going to have a kind of presentation
because this is a presentation for – in the parliament for the Paris – coming from the Paris. This is the way they
13


Banco Santander SA

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
match this and we want to know this same morning. If this affects Spanish operations, our global operation side, I
have no idea. I do expect that this affect Spanish operations. But we'll see what happens when this is presented
to the parliament today.
ALCO in Spain, we don't have ALCO in Spain, zero. We don't have bonds. You're asking me for the level of
potential ALCO portfolio. Well, if I look at the – we have a negative duration of five years in the balance sheet in
Spain. If you were to offset all of this, the portfolio will be very, very large. Yeah? So, you can do the maths here
on, but will be very large. But what seems to me is a reasonable ALCO portfolio for Spain is to put the duration of
the balance sheet between the minus two and plus two years. Yeah? That is normally where we imagine the
portfolio is set in extraordinary times when the rates went into negative territory.
We're going to reconstruct this portfolio little by little, depending on our view on the market and trying to put the
balance sheet with a less negative duration. We haven't started, but we will, for sure, start at some point when we
think it's the appropriate time.
Banamex, well, as you know, we've been very transparent on this. We're interested in the asset. We put the
conditions. One of the conditions were the price, naturally, the price. The return on investment was in
commissions, not to issue shares, so we told you openly. We submit a non-binding offer and, well, we were told
that we are not going to continue in the process. That's it. There is no more to us, yeah. So, we were disciplined
and well, as I said before to your colleague, before, we think that we have – we put a price asking for a return on
investment attractive for our shareholders, knowing that we have a good chance of gaining market share in the
new situation and growing organically, and adding several percentage points of market share in Mexico with our
shift in franchise.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjie Creelan-Sandford Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two questions on the revenue outlook
please. First of all, just on the Digital Consumer Bank, I guess looking in the quarter, volumes are going up, but
margins are going down. So, I'm just wondering if you could discuss a little bit about what you're seeing in terms
of consumer loan demand across the European business? How are clients reacting to cost of living pressures
versus what are still very good employment trends? And in terms of margins in the consumer business, there are
lag effects in terms of asset repricing that is weighing on margins or are you seeing increasing pricing competition
in that segment?
The second question was just a clarification on Brazil and the NII outlook in the second half of the year. So, I
understood that you expect the sort of the repricing or the rate repricing to sort of level out in the 4Q. So, should
we assume that NII will be down sequentially in 3Q again? And perhaps, if you could just be a bit more precise or
offer any more guidance around kind of the rebound because the lag effect in the rate repricing runs off into 2023.
I know you give guidance on the rate sensitivity on a year-one basis. Can you give any indication of what that rate
sensitivity looks like on the year-two basis in Brazil? Thank you.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The first question, allow me to elaborate on Digital Consumer Bank, consumer loan demand in Europe. The
consumer loan demand is not bad, I should say. It's good, yeah. So, the problem with our portfolio here is
basically €120 billion, of which €85 billion or north of €85 billion is related with auto and the remaining is basically
that [ph] declining (00:52:49) on point of sale. We are seeing good trends in bulk business, but lead times in the
auto industry are getting very, very long.
To give you a proxy of this, normally, we have a stock finance that we fund the inventory of the cars' dealers
normally in the region of €13 billion to €15 billion. Now, this is running at half of this is €6 billion, €7 billion. This
tells you an indication where the industry is in the capacity to deliver the demand they have. On the other side, I
mentioned for the US, but the same happens in Europe. The activity in used car markets and the price in used car
markets is strong.
Our origination this year, we're going to go to the €50 billion mark. This is where our originations are growing
10%, but this is because we are gaining share. Okay. The market is not there. Car sales are falling significantly.
What happens is we are gaining share all across. And for that reason, we are growing 10% in originations.
The second question, this is the situation of the market. The second question was more margin and pricing. This
business [ph] led me to (00:54:10) start with the balance sheet of this business. This business, as I have said,
close to €120 billion loan book. The majority of this fixed rate, normally with a duration of around two years. Yeah.
Funded [indiscernible] (00:54:28) combination of deposits in the region of €40 billion, and the rest is wholesale
funding, normally issuance and securitizations and other things, while we tend to have relatively very low interest
rate risk in this business.
What is happening with the margins? Yields are going up not at the state of what is happening in the [ph] swap
year card (00:54:58). But this is the usual factor that this business follow, normally started to go up a couple of
months ago, more so in countries in which the rates went up faster before like the UK and the other markets are
following. And I don't see a path of now differently than the one I was expecting, yeah.
So, normally, this business suffer a little bit, not that much because the combination of 40% deposits and 60%
wholesale funding the majority of this with around two years duration. We can't accommodate the majority of this
and not to suffer that much on the margin side. The fee income is doing well on the other side on the back of
[indiscernible] (00:55:40) activity and if the activity recovers, I do not expect this significant margin compression
there [indiscernible] (00:55:49) we cannot pass 100% the very first day. We pass over a period of three, four
months the new prices to the new origination.
In Brazil, you mentioned the outlook, the fourth quarter and rebound in Brazil, when the rebound is going to
happen. José gave you some indications of this. Basically, what happens in Brazil as long as rates go up. So let
me explain the NII in Brazil. NII in Brazil in the loan book is going up. It went up, has been going up. In the
market-related activities collapsed and went into negative territory, remained. The rates went from 2% to 12%.
When this is going to turn around? So, normally, when you finish the tightening cycle, it takes around two
quarters, yeah, to go up, okay? So we think that we are close to the peak, but we will see. We think that it's a
couple of basis points still to come from the Central Bank of Brazil, probably 75 basis points, probably 100 basis
points, I don't know, in this region. And two quarters afterwards, we're going to show up this in NII. Yeah, Jose
mentioned 2023 for the rebound, expecting that with the Central Bank rates – in the official rate in Brazil peaks
August/September this year, okay? So, this is our outlook for Brazil.

Having said that, the customer business, so, the loan book, the spread of the loan book is going up. But the
financial activities went from positive territory to negative territory this year and main swing we have there. This is
going to fade away as long as the portfolio mature and renew all these things. Yeah. Those are the dynamics in
Brazil.

Operator: The next question is coming from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation. I have two questions on the US, both around asset
quality. So, if you can kind of let us know your view about what we need to monitor, to gauge when and how
quickly asset quality kind of start deteriorating? If it's unemployment, like you were mentioning, the European
consumer finance operation, or you're also concerned around collateral prices going down and reversing then the
peak that we have seen the last couple of years?
And the second question around this is, I mean, obviously the units will pay and they have been blended into one.
I mean, we don't have the disclosure between SCUSA and the rest of the bank any longer, and there has been
significant changes on the mix of SCUSA in recent years as well. So, it's difficult for us actually to have a kind of a
realistic view about this through-the-cycle cost of risk for the unit. So, if you can share with us basically the view
you have on where can actually cost of risk in the US land in a normal environment? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The first question about asset quality, what we are looking when this start deteriorating, naturally,
unemployment rate is one of the key drivers also in the US. You mentioned us, what is going on. Let me provide
you a little bit what's going on in SCUSA in terms of the dynamics of the business now. We are seeing a
significant – we are generating in the loan book with a cycle that is 35 points above what we were generating one
year ago. So this is [ph] by generating this (00:59:45). The pricing model is quite sophisticated and goes along
with the cycles SCUSA are generating. So this explain a little bit the trend changes there.
Second, leasing business, now the dynamics are different from any time we have seen before. Normally, leasing
businesses works in a way that the customers take the car and three years later or four years later, they give us
back the car and we dispose the car in an auction to the market. And this process, in normal times, is a process
that produce very little profits, very little losses. Yeah.
What has happened around this period is in 2021, this was a very profitable business in 2020 on the back of very
high second half used car market price. But in 2022, what we are seeing is the customers are not returning back
the cars to us. They prefer to selling their own, given the high prices prevailing in the used car markets, and this
16


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
changed the dynamics in the P&L. [ph] That's the reason (01:01:07) that you see that the – I think it's in the other
income. You see a significant decrease in the other income due to this phenomenon. Last year, we made out of
this €200 million. [indiscernible] (01:01:18) we are making very little out of this process.
Asset quality, we expect – we, traditionally, we were around 4%, 4-something-percent in SCUSA. In the cost of
risk, less than 5%. And now, the cost of risk in US, the whole US is 1.5%. So, what the bank is – you split
between the bank – the bank has very low cost of risk, [ph] meaning less (01:01:51) and all the cost of risk you
have seen now, the 1.5% comes from SCUSA, okay? This normalization will happen over time and depends not
necessarily [ph] bet (01:02:03) on the past. As we are generating higher [indiscernible] (01:02:07), we also expect
lower cost of risk when the unemployment deteriorating – unemployment continues to be the main driver, not as
much interest rates.
Remember that we are lending a very high [ph] GIL (01:02:19) and the impact of additional 100 basis points or 50
or 200 basis points in the [ph] GIL (01:02:25) is not meaningful when you are lending at 20% or something like
that. So, [indiscernible] (01:02:31) 21% is not as important as it is in the prime space where the changes in rates
can produce more significant changes in the monthly installments. I think I answered your questions, yeah?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Yes, hi. Hi, good morning. So, a couple of questions from my side as well. First is just something – well, the first
one is related to follow-up [indiscernible] (01:03:09) if I missed exactly the guidance that you have given for NII in
Brazil for the full year.
And on the second question was I mean on the outlook for cost of risk in Spain. I believe that in the past, you
have mentioned something in the areas of 50 basis points. Right now, cost of risk is still trending a bit above
those levels. I was wondering how you see it for the second half of the year and possibly into [indiscernible]
(01:03:39). Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
So, NII in Brazil, you have a – so, a mid-single digit growth in Brazil is what you should expect for NII in Brazil for
the whole year, yeah. While the cost of risk in Spain hasn't changed our expectations, we said 50 basis points to
60 basis points for the whole year. Probably this is what you should expect for Spain this year.
Well, naturally, this means, as you know, the cost of risk now largely depends on the macro scenarios, yeah. And,
well, I told you that €600 million in the first half came from the macro, while the second half, the macro is so
uncertain in these days that, well, we will see what kind of macro we introduce at the end of the year. But if the
macro remains as it is today, let's take IMF expectations that they published yesterday or a day before yesterday,
it should stay in these levels. Yeah. So, as I said to you before, we do not expect a big deal this year on the
ground coming from the cost of risk. Yeah.

Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Thank you. Two questions. One on rate sensitivity, this is the flavor of the moment, but the visibility you're giving
is still quite low compared to other names. Can you please give us for each main area your 12-month rate
sensitivity assuming zero deposits beta that you plugged in the forward curve that we can all see just to add some
transparency on that front? And I didn't understand quite well before, José Antonio, your elaboration around the
reason not to have any Spanish bonds, ALCO portfolio in Spain and how big the ALCO should be in a normalized
scenario?
The second question is on Brazil, again, on the rate sensitivity. You elaborated quite a lot around this. But I
wanted to understand in Brazilian real's term, what you would expect then to be the tailwind on a full phasing
when the liability repricing stops and the asset repricing of the current rates level is completed to understand the
[ph] swing independent on (01:06:30) from the negative headwind to the positive tailwind and, hence, how much
can be stay in terms of cost of risk? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to elaborate. José will guide you to the specific details on the numbers you see. Sensitivity to rates,
yeah, so we're going to give you and it's in the presentation the [indiscernible] (01:06:58) high level, I should say
that with the [indiscernible] (01:07:05), normally, what happens is this is a process that is accelerating. So, if I take
the call 2023 with the forward rates probably in Europe, we should think that our business in Europe, €2 billion,
north of €2 billion probably. This is a figure that, well, you know there's plenty of numbers there, but this is a figure
that sounds reasonable to me.
You asked for the Spanish ALCO. Well, [indiscernible] (01:07:35) for having an ALCO between €20 billion and
€40 billion is something that sounds to me reasonable too. ALCO does not necessarily mean one single
[indiscernible] (01:07:47). It means a portfolio of fixed rate assets that we do not generate in commercial terms. In
commercial terms, as you know, while the majority of our 80% of the mortgage book, the majority of the lending to
SMEs and corporates, and 100% of the lending to CIB or almost 100% of the lending to CIB is floating rate.
So, on the other way around is [ph] unlimited (01:08:12) asset that we generate a fixed rate and, for that reason,
the need of having a significant ALCO portfolio in Spain that we don't have because our view of our interest rates
was that they should go up. And that's the reason why we don't have this portfolio. José, you want to clarify the
specific data...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. The reason we give a parallel shift – well, parallel shift really, it's from 1 day to 12 months. This is activity
we have – doesn't go beyond 12 months, obviously. So, when we talk about a parallel shift, we are talking about a
movement between overnight and 12 months. And the reason we give a parallel shift is because today, for
18


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2022
instance, the market is expecting rates in Europe to stay at 1%, while just a month ago, it was much higher than
that. So it's much better to look at sensitivity.
And then for a parallel shift, which is again, a movement between a day and 12 months and then you put your
own outlook of rates. But for the parallel shift of 100 basis points and a 25% beta, the sensitivity in Spain is €750
million, in the UK is €300 million, most of which we have already seen, by the way. So in the UK, we would expect
further sensitivity in the second half of this year and then probably some stabilization in 2023, €140 million in the
US.
For the second year, this is relevant for Brazil. And in Brazil in the second year, we would expect a positive
sensitivity of around €150 million. So if we are right and then the last interest rate hike explains in August-
September and then we start seeing the positive sensitivity flowing through the P&L in Brazil towards the end of
this year, beginning of next year then we should see this sensitivity in the P&L in Brazil, which is around €140
million, €150 million. This sensitivity to a parallel shift is in the presentation. Thank you, Andrea.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. A couple of questions from me, one is on M&A appetite now
that you rule out Mexico. There's been some reports in the media about you exploring some agreements or
expanding the agreements with carmakers in Europe. You've always been very interested in your [indiscernible]
(01:11:11) business so could that be an area where you could do some bolt-on deals? And how materials, if you
could quantify that, they might be in terms of capital consumption if it's possible to give a [indiscernible]
(01:11:24)?
And then I understand there's been some pop-ups in the macro provisions overlay. Could you elaborate on which
countries you've been – in which countries you've allocated that provision [indiscernible] (01:11:38) aren't really
talking about COVID overlay. So it would be interesting to see what if you differ from them. And that's it. That's my
two questions. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Carlos. Well, M&A appetite, well, we are not looking. What you mentioned is agreement with OEMs.
Well, we look at this as much as a BAU. If you look backwards in the last year, we signed three important deals.
The main one was Stellantis that was a restructuring of the previous deal that will bring to us – our portfolio as a
result of this will grow in the region of €5 billion. And we did an agreement with Stellantis.
We reached another important agreement with Mitsubishi to be the provider in the US. And we'd done another
agreement, very important this one with Honda in Mexico to be the provider for Honda in Mexico. Naturally, we
have this plenty of discussions in some cases for one country, in some cases for one country and some cases for
the whole Europe. Probably we have several of those open, but nothing that I can communicate at this stage

because – but I see this as a BAU for the division of the car consumer finance. Reaching agreements with the
OEMs means in some cases that we establish a joint venture with them, in which we match the financial side and
then match the commercial side of the joint venture or providing white label to them and provide our services
here.
We agreed in this – I forgot to mention that we also reached an agreement in Greece last year with the main
importer in Greece that has 30% market share. But this is, as I should say, business as usual and is in our
projections that we gave for the business as usual in the Digital Consumer Bank space. The provisions
[indiscernible] (01:13:51), I said before, while this is €100 million is roughly speaking numbers, €100 million in
Spain, €260 million in UK, and €130 million in US. So, those are the €600 million that you have embedded due to
macro in their first half results.

Thank you, José Antonio, and thank you, Carlos, for your question. Can we have the last question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The last question is coming from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah, José. Good morning. I've got two questions, please. One is on the rate outlook for Brazil. The consensus
expects that there will be rate cuts in 2023, and maybe you can help us walk through the dynamics of your NII
outlook then. Would we see even wider spreads at the end of second half of 2023, depending, of course, on the
timing?
And my second question will be on Poland. Do you have any update on the WIBOR issues there? Do you expect
this surge to become a legal case and drag on? What's the latest from the ground? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
In the rate outlook for Brazil, we expect the rates to pick further sooner than later, but maybe [ph] never
(01:15:11), maybe September this year. And, well, when the rates start to go down, more difficult to say. But as
you know, in the [indiscernible] (01:15:20) the CFO already elaborate on this. Normally, you should expect a one,
two quarters negative or positive. And afterwards, the commercial dynamics prevail, yeah. So, but overall, those
are the dynamics and what you should expect from NII. And this is the outlook for rates in Brazil, well, still highly
uncertain next year. Yeah.
Poland, you're asking me if this is a legal case, it's too early to tell. Well, naturally, we're, as of today, we're
analyzing the situation. I provide you the impact assuming a 50% take-up on the mortgage moratoria. This is a
significant damage for the system as a whole. And while our colleagues, the [indiscernible] (01:16:18) in Poland
will take a view on this and while this is not an unusual case, this is a whole financial community in Poland that
should take the appropriate view on this when we finish to analyze the proposal from the government.

Yeah. If I may add, in terms of the WIBOR, we just know that there's a proposal to change it, but we don't have
the details. It will start next year, but there are no details at all with regards to the change in the WIBOR. It will be
very difficult to change the index.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
I know you want to elaborate, but it would go against recommendations for index regulation in Europe. So it would
be very difficult to change. But we have no news.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
The proposal is difficult to execute. As José said, it's European regulations [indiscernible] (01:17:08) this way and
that's the situation. We did not expect any news soon on this. Okay.
