Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported third
quarter revenues of $10.9 billion, up 25% over last year's third quarter, and earnings per share of $2.27. These
strong results once again reflect accelerating momentum in our core business as billings on our network reached
record highs for the third quarter driven by goods and services spending. In my remarks this morning, I want to
put into context the decisions that we made pre-pandemic, when the pandemic hit and during the pandemic to
drive the growth we are now seeing and the increased confidence we now have in our business model.
In 2018, we introduced a new financial growth algorithm which called for high-single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit EPS growth. Prior to the pandemic, we achieved those objectives for 10 straight quarters through
focused and increased investment levels in our business. We executed strategies for profitably growing the
business which were based on initiatives to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing
customers in both our Consumer and Commercial businesses. And while our differentiated business model gave
us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities we saw, we also knew that the favorable economic
conditions we had at the time could change. So we also developed a plan for winning through the downcycle that
focused on protecting our customers and our colleagues and maintaining our capital strength while investing
strategically and at the right time to rebuild momentum so we could win during a recovery.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Through it all, the driving force behind everything we do, from product innovations to our investment decisions is
to continue to make the American Express brand special and back our customers. Over the last several years, we
focused our strategies on broadening the appeal of core products to attract new customers, particularly millennial
and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our leadership position with SME customers by providing more ways
to help them manage and grow their businesses. To accomplish those objectives, we made a series of
investments, and I'll highlight a few. We put in place a strategy for consistently refreshing our core premium
products, adding value with expanded and relevant new benefits targeted at key consumer and small business
customers, and we charged for that added value. We added a host of new digital capabilities for consumers and
small businesses and expanded and enhanced our mobile app to appeal to the digital lifestyles of our target
customers.
We're an early mover in launching our buy now, pay later capability, Pay It Plan It, which we introduced to
address the evolving borrowing preferences of our customers. We increased our focus on working with strategic
partners to help us enrich our value propositions, expand our network and broaden our digital capabilities and
offerings. For example, we negotiated wide-ranging long-term agreements with key co-brand partners such as
Delta, Hilton, and Amazon. We also expanded partnerships with digital giants such as PayPal and added a new
variety of partners to our ecosystem, including fintechs such as Bill.com and Better, and lifestyle brands such as
Equinox. We achieved virtual parity coverage in the US and we increased coverage internationally through a
more targeted approach while increasing the number of compelling offers and benefits that our merchants deliver
to our Card Members.
When the pandemic hit unexpectedly in early 2020, we responded by activating our plan for winning through the
cycle, using the same customer-focused approach to concentrate on retaining our customers and addressing their
immediate needs. We moved quickly to enhance and expand our financial relief programs to assist our customers
who suddenly faced financial hardships. Our frontline servicing team stepped up to ensure we continue to provide
the world-class service our customers have come to expect from American Express. We pivoted the value
proposition to several of our premium products, adding temporary benefits on categories that were relevant to
how customers' spending behaviors have changed such as wireless, streaming, food delivery and others. This
has produced lasting behavioral changes as spending in a number of these categories, including wireless and
streaming, has proven to be sustainable.
Soon after, we turned our attention to small businesses who needed help by launching the largest global small
business campaign in the company's history, creating the Stand for Small coalition, and supporting minority-
owned small businesses in the United States. As last year progressed, we learned from our customers what
resonated with them in this unprecedented environment, and we grew more confident to seize the growth
opportunities we saw emerging. So we revved up our investments in Card Member acquisitions and value
proposition innovations to capitalize on those opportunities and start rebuilding of our growth momentum.
We also saw an opportunity to accelerate our strategy to bring new digital, beyond-the-card capabilities to our
small business customers and acquired Kabbage, one of the leading providers of digital cash management
platforms. Importantly, the increasing demand we're seeing for our products and what we learned from the early
value proposition enhancements encouraged us to restart our product refresh strategy last year. And in July, we
launched our new consumer Platinum Card in the US. We're repeating this customer-led product innovation
strategy with the refresh of the US Business Platinum Card which we launched last week. As with the consumer
card refresh, the new benefits we added to our Business Platinum in key spend categories such as electronics,
software, shipping, wireless and others were informed by our Card Members' desires.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Coming into 2021, we were emboldened by the strong results we were seeing toward the end of 2020 from our
customer retention and acquisition efforts, and we decided to double-down our investments in marketing, product
innovations, technology and people to accelerate our growth momentum. All these decisions, those that we made
before the pandemic, when the pandemic hit and through this year as conditions began to improve are driving the
results we're seeing today. For example, customer acquisitions have gained momentum over the last five quarters
with 2.6 million new cards in force in the third quarter. Demand for our premium fee-based products has been
particularly robust with acquisitions of our US consumer and small business Platinum and Gold Cards reaching
all-time highs in the quarter. In consumer, millennial and Gen Z customers have driven this growth with 75% of
new US Gold and Platinum consumer cards coming from these customers. In commercial, we had one of the best
quarters ever for US small business card acquisitions.
Our focus on meeting the needs of SMEs and millennial and Gen Z consumer customers has resulted in these
groups being the most resilient throughout the pandemic, leading to growth in spending. In fact, spending from
these groups continued to accelerate in the third quarter with goods and services spending from SMEs growing
21% above 2019 levels and overall spending for millennial and Gen Z customers particularly strong, up 38% over
2019 levels. Our initiatives to protect our customers at the beginning of the pandemic has driven retention and
satisfaction metrics higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the digital capabilities we've introduced have driven
steady increases in digital engagement. For example, approximately 85% of active Card Members are digitally
engaged with us, and we had the highest-ever daily active user engagement across the web and mobile in August
with a nearly 17% increase year-over-year.
As these examples show, the strategies we implemented to profitably grow our business before the pandemic
began, coupled with the decisions we made in executing our strategy to manage through the pandemic and to win
during the recovery have generated strong, consistent momentum as the environment continues to improve, and
what we've learned through this past year is informing our strategy for investing to profitably grow our business
moving forward. Looking ahead, we're operating from a position of strength and we see even more opportunities
to build on the momentum we've created. So we will continue to invest strategically in seeking to drive even
higher levels of sustainable long-term revenue and EPS growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss our third quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions.
Thank you.

Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results
which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke
about. You see this momentum in our summary financials on slide 2 with third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion,
up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis; third quarter net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of
$2.27.
To get right into a more detailed look at our results, let's talk about how the strategies that Steve just discussed
have helped to drive our volumes back above pre-pandemic levels as you can see on slide 3. You will notice in
the several views of volumes that begin on slide 3 that we continue to show third quarter volume trends on both a
year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 as we find this provides a clearer picture of the progress we are making
in building growth momentum. We did see continued momentum in spending volumes in the third quarter with
total network volumes and billed business volumes both up around 30% year-over-year and up 4% relative to
2019 on an FX-adjusted basis.

This growth in billed business is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services which
you can see on slide 4 represents 79% of our overall billed business and was up 19% versus 2019 and
strengthened sequentially versus Q2. We are very pleased with this continued strength in goods and services
spending given the investments we've made in premium Card Member engagement, prospect acquisition,
growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners.
Focusing in first on our Consumer business on slide 5, overall spending was 9% above 2019 levels as growth in
goods and services volumes accelerated to 20% above 2019 in the third quarter. For many years, we've been
focused on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of Card Members through expanding our value propositions
and digital capabilities. Aided by these efforts, you see that millennials and Gen Z customers are leading the
growth in spending, reaching 38% above 2019 levels for the quarter while our older age cohorts have shown
continued, steady, though smaller improvement as well.
Turning to our Commercial business, as you know, we've been very focused on helping our small and medium-
size enterprise clients run their business by expanding the range of products and capabilities to meet their B2B
payments and working capital needs. This strategic focus on SMEs has been key in driving the performance you
see on slide 6. Global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the
most resilient across all of our customer types with spending up 11% versus 2019 driven by strong growth in B2B
spending on goods and services which grew 21% above 2019 levels in Q3. In contrast, large and global corporate
card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continue to show fewer signs of
recovery. We've said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.
Digging into goods and services spending trends on slide 7, we continue to see strong growth in online and card-
not-present spending which was up 27% versus 2019 even as offline spending fully recovered in the third quarter,
demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. We also saw growth
across all categories of goods and services spending with both consumer and SMEs driving the strong growth in
retail and wholesale spending and SMEs leading the growth in advertising and media spending.
Turning now to T&E spending on slide 8, you continue to see a recovery that is on track with our expectation that
we'll reach 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. T&E spending improved sequentially versus Q2 and we're
pleased to see restaurant spending, our most resilient and now largest T&E category, back above pre-pandemic
levels in the quarter. We did see some modest impacts from the Delta variant in the airline category where the
pace of recovery slowed a bit in August, but it has strengthened again in September and into early October. The
trends we have seen reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover but at
varying paces across customer types and geographies, and we remain focused on maintaining our leadership
position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they
return to travel.
Turning to our last look at volumes on slide 9, you do see that the overall billed business volume recovery
continues to be led by the US which first surpassed 2019 levels in Q2 and was up 9% in the third quarter.
Importantly though, growth in goods and services spending has been strong both in the US and outside of the US.
Overall, spending is only weaker outside the US because historically, we have more travel-related spending in our
international regions and international T&E is recovering more slowly than in the US given cross-border travel
restrictions.
Looking ahead, based on current trends, we still assume that overall T&E spending globally will recover to around
80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even more importantly, we expect continued strong growth
momentum in goods and services spending. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Moving on then to receivable and loan balances on slide 10. Loan balances continued to slowly recover in the
third quarter and were up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Relative to 2019 though, loan balances
remained down 10% as we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to
higher pay-down rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. I would
point out that we have hit an inflection point on revolving loan balances. And though it will take time for those
balances to rebuild as pay-down rates are likely to remain elevated in the near-term, we believe over the long-
term we can get back to growing our loan volumes faster than the industry. For the next few quarters though, I
continue to expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes.
Turning next to credit and provision on slides 11 through 13. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key
points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with
Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan
balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over
time. However, given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off
rates in the next few quarters.
This strong credit performance combined with further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook drove a $191
million provision expense benefit in the third quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release
as shown on slide 12. That said, we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance
programs have yet to roll off and that there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic
environment. In addition, we are closely monitoring how the Card Members exiting our financial relief programs
are performing, though the early performance of the Card Members that have exited these programs has looked
quite strong.
As you see on slide 13, we ended the third quarter with $3.6 billion of reserves, representing 4.5% of our loan
balances and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances respectively, which is only slightly below the reserve
levels we had pre-pandemic. So given that our credit metrics are still around historical lows, I would say that we
continue to hold an appropriately significant amount of reserves driven by the remaining uncertainties I just spoke
about.
Moving next to revenues on slide 14, total revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. We had
double-digit growth in all of our non-interest revenue lines and we are starting to see growth in net interest income
as well. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that
other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the third quarter primarily
driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we're beginning to see, though they still remain well below 2019
levels.
Turning to our largest revenue line, discount revenue on slide 15, you see it grew 33% year-over-year on an FX-
adjusted basis and is now comfortably above 2019 levels. This growth was primarily driven by the steady
momentum in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues
continued to grow as consistently as they have throughout the entire pandemic, up 27% year-over-year in the
third quarter. These card fee revenues are now 27% higher than they were back in the third quarter of 2019 as
you can see on slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the
continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers.
Turning to net interest income on slide 17, you can see that it was up 6% year-over-year. Though still growing
slower relative to the other revenue lines, we have clearly hit an inflection point. This growth was slower than the

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our
historically low credit costs and to higher pay-down rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower
recovery in revolving loan balances. We did see a modest sequential improvement in revolving loan balances in
the third quarter. But looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in
loan volumes.
So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q3 as you can see on slide
18 with revenue up 24% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Looking forward, with the strength in goods and
services spend growth we've seen in the first three quarters of the year, we now assume that full year revenue
growth could be around 15% if current trends continue.
The revenue momentum we've seen this year has clearly been accelerated as a result of the investments we've
been making in marketing, value propositions, technology and people, and those investments show up across the
expense lines you see on slide 19. Let me start at the bottom with operating expenses which were up 3% year-
over-year in the third quarter. Looking forward, I still expect our full-year OpEx to be below the $11.5 billion we
originally expected as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing in
technology and our people to drive long-term growth in our business.
Moving on to variable customer engagement expenses at the top of slide 19, there are a few things to think about.
Most importantly, in 2020 we added some incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we
refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related
aspects of our value propositions. The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing
investment line and are now winding down. We are able to wind them down because our customers are again
engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, which is a good thing in terms of longer-term
customer retention and growth prospects.
It does, however, mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. As
one example of the financial implications of customers again engaging in travel-related aspects of our
Membership Rewards program, in the rewards line, we made a roughly $200 million adjustment this quarter to our
Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. Looking forward,
as I've said in the past few quarters, I expect these variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around
40% of total revenues.
Turning next to the marketing investments we're making to build growth momentum, you can see on slide 20 that
we invested $1.4 billion in marketing in the third quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisition while
winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.6 million new cards, up 87% year-over-year and 6%
sequentially in the third quarter. Much more importantly though than just the total number of cards, we focused
internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from new acquisitions, and revenues
from this quarter's acquisitions are trending stronger than what we saw pre-pandemic.
One key driver of this performance is the great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts
acquired on these products more than doubling year-over-year and representing 65% of the new accounts
acquired in the quarter. In particular, acquisitions of new US consumer and small business Platinum and Gold
Card Members were at all-time highs this quarter, and this was again one of the best quarters for small business
new account acquisitions in the US. Based on the opportunities we've seen in the first three quarters of 2021, we
now expect to invest over $5 billion in marketing for the year. We feel really good about the results we've seen
from our strategic investments and see an opportunity to continue to invest during the recovery to maximize
sustainable long-term growth.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Turning next to capital on slide 21, our CET1 ratio was 12.6% at the end of the third quarter which declined from
the prior quarter but remained above our target ratio of 10% to 11%. In the quarter, we returned $3.6 billion of
capital to our shareholders, including common stock purchases of $3.3 billion and $337 million in common stock
dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation. Looking forward, we
expect our CET1 ratio to migrate to our target range over the next few quarters as we continue to return to
shareholders the excess capital we hold and generate while supporting balance sheet growth.
So let's close by talking about what the signs and momentum we saw in the first three quarters of this year might
mean for the future. As a reminder, we started the year with a wide range of scenarios of potential outcomes for
2021 as we did not know how the medical and economic environment would evolve during the year and the
impact it would have most importantly on our credit reserves. Now, three quarters into the year, the macro outlook
has steadily improved and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. We've already released
$2.3 billion of reserves accounting for over $2 of EPS year-to-date. That still leaves us, however, with a lot of
reserves due to the remaining uncertainties I spoke about earlier.
So our updated scenario 1 on slide 22 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical environment and
economic outlook does not improve further and that we therefore don't release any additional credit reserves this
year. That could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $8.90 per share. Our updated scenario 2 in contrast
assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance as the remaining stimulus and forbearance programs
roll off and that we also see continued improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and in all
likelihood a lower level of credit reserves. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $9.50.
In closing, we feel really good about the progress we've made this year as a result of our investments in
marketing, value propositions, technology and our people. And as the year has gone on, we've gotten even more
confident in our ability to deploy significant resources towards building sustainable long-term growth momentum.
Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS
expectations we originally had for 2020 in 2022 and to continue to drive towards higher levels of sustainable
growth over the long-term.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So as we look ahead to next year, Jeff, you said that you expect to be on the high end of your original 2020 which
is what you had mentioned last quarter. If we look back to that timeframe, you were expecting mid to high losses,
mid to high 2s losses; provisions were going to be in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range versus where I look now,
losses are running sub-1 and you noted you don't expect them to move up that much for the next few quarters. So
can you maybe just, one, Jeff, talk about some of the puts and takes such that you wouldn't be above the high
end given how much leverage you have from credit? And then second, Steve, maybe you could expand on the
comment that Jeff made to continue to invest to maximize the long-term growth that can help you sustain the
financial algorithm that you laid out at the beginning of the call. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So let me start, Ryan, by pointing out in my remarks we've already this year, because of the environment, added
over $2 of EPS to our earnings just from releasing credit reserves. So as you think about my comments about
2022, we assume next year we'll have strong credit results, but you're going to go from having a several billion-
dollar good guy on the provision side this year to having more of a normalized for the new world of lower credit
losses provision expense next year. So we see that as a pretty impressive grow-over to, in fact, be confident in
getting to the high end of where we originally thought we'd be in 2020 next year considering the magnitude of that
grow-over considering that it's not reliant on a full recovery across all of our businesses. We actually see tailwinds
that probably will help us in 2022 and into 2023. And that's why as I turn it over to Steve, I think we are so
emboldened by the progress we've seen bringing new people into the franchise, Ryan, that we think we have an
opportunity here to continue to invest significant resources to drive longer-term even higher levels of sustainable
growth.

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Look, if you would've asked me at the beginning of the year would we invest almost $5 billion in marketing this
year, I would've said no. But we're not governed by what level we think we should or what anybody thinks we
should hit; we're governed by the fact that there are tremendous opportunities out there. And when you look at
what is going on sort of with our acquisition activities right now, look, we brought in 2.6 million cardholders. And
what we really focus on is what revenue those cardholders really bring in, and what we're seeing is we're seeing a

cardholder base that is spending more than we're bringing in, that has a better FICO profile and it's skewing
millennial and it's skewing fee-paying. And so as we run our models, we'll be governed by can we continue to
acquire these Card Members, and we are.
And the reality is that – and I said this from day one – we're running this for the medium to long-term. And the
reality is if we continue to find those great opportunities in the consumer base, in the SME base, in some
opportunities beyond the card that we might have, we'll continue to invest. So as we look at it right now, our plan
is to continue to be aggressive with our investments, constrained by our investment return models, not
constrained by a certain level that people think we should or should not be at. And that's just the way we've been
running the business for the last few years, and we'll continue to do that. And I think it's really served us well
during the pandemic; I don't think you would've thought that this year, we would've spent that kind of money. But I
think the key point is we're spending that money to grow the business profitably. We're not spending that money
because we're in some battle to keep up with the Joneses here, okay?

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
A couple of questions here. First, just following-up on that. On the marketing side, it seems like that is in line with
what you've been spending historically as a percentage of revenues. So should we take your comments to mean
that you would ramp that up from here or that there's a trajectory of marketing expense spend that's going to be
similar to what you've had in the past as a percentage of revs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think, Betsy, what you should take is that we're not governed by thinking about okay, we got to keep the
percent of revenue that marketing represents constant or similar to where it was in 2019. We're governed by the
universe of really attractive opportunities we see to build longer-term growth momentum. So that's what has
driven our marketing spend now, including value injection to over $5 billion this year much higher than Steve and I
started the year thinking it would be. And as we think about 2022, we're very confident in the kind of EPS outcome
that we've been talking about. But the ultimate amount of marketing that goes with that is going to be a function of
the attractive opportunities. And because we're getting such great growth from the spending as Steve talked
about, we're actually generating more revenue from the dollars that we're investing in marketing than we were

pre-pandemic. The marketing starts to become a little self-funding while still hitting our EPS targets if the
opportunities are there, so that's what's going to drive us in terms of how much marketing we do next year.
And was there a part two, Betsy, if the operator keeps you on?

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi, and good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Not surprisingly, I also have a question on marketing
and engagement spending. So in terms of maybe just talking about it at a little bit of a higher level, like in terms of
competition, I understand that American Express has always been in a very competitive market for many years.
Maybe talk about the dimensions of the competition. Have they changed post-competition? Are you seeing
different players? And also, just in terms of your marketing and customer acquisition spending, how is it different
today than it was maybe pre-pandemic, like in 2019? Is there – are you making investments in different things?
Are customers asking for different things?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So, look, the only time I'd say competition sort of ramped down was during the pandemic when nobody was really
acquiring a lot of cards. But when we look at the range of competitors, you have to realize that we're looking at
competitors on a global basis, country-by-country. We're looking at competitors across corporate card, small
business, and consumer cards. And I think as we talk to, quite honestly, as we talk to you guys about competition,
where the drive tends to be is consumer competition in the US, and the reality is that this has been a competitive
market since the financial crisis. I mean, I think the consumer card competition really heated up after the financial
crisis when the big money center banks decided to really get serious about their consumer card business. And a
lot of them have done a really good job, and we compete very vigorously with them. And so, I don't really think –
in my mind, I don't think it's changed all that much. I think it paused a little bit during the pandemic, but I don't
think it's changed at all.
The other thing that I would say is there are a range of other competitors out there, fintechs and what have you.
And we continue to watch them, whether it's competitors in the corporate card space, competitors in other places.
From a buy now, pay later perspective, that's not really a big competitive threat to us. I mean, when you think
about buy now, pay later, it tends to be targeted at low FICO, it tends to be targeted at a lot of debit card users.
It's used as a customer acquisition vehicle, and that's just not the game that we're playing. We've had a buy now,
pay later product since 2017 and it's just another way for our Card Members to manage their spending within the
overall American Express relationship. It's a transaction-by-transaction management tool which, quite honestly, is
a lot more flexible than point-of-sale buy now, pay later because you don't know who's going to actually have
point of sale at every merchant you go to. And then, for the pay in four people which is also another thing that's
out there which is a version of buy now, pay later, actually, our charge card product gives you more float and
gives you rewards.
But you have to look at all this stuff, whether it's whoever is coming into the space. So we look at competitors all
the time and you have to evaluate how it attacks your customer base. But I think the way we run this business,
and you've seen this over decades, is we continually put more value and build a bigger moat around our
customers. And just look at what we've done with the Platinum Card here. We refreshed this product while it was
12

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
going gang busters, both of them. We were at record levels of Platinum acquisition before the refresh and yet, we
went out and refreshed and went out and raised the fee. And how can you do that? Because you're adding more
value both on the consumer side and both on the small business side. And so, look, in the third quarter, we have
record levels of not only Platinum but Gold Card acquisition for our base. So, we feel really good about that.
I think as far as how you spend your money, look, obviously the industry has changed. You do a lot less direct
mail than you used to do. There's a lot more sort of aggregator acquisition. But I think what's really important
about us and as we look at our marketing spend, we look at our marketing spend not only for prospect marketing,
but we invest in our customers. And we spend marketing money on our customers to continue to grow their
spend, to upgrade their product, to introduce them to our lending capabilities, and it creates a flywheel, right?
Because what you do is you bring these prospects in and then you manage these prospects and get them to
become more and more profitable. And one of the things that we hang our hat on is we look at our customers as a
platform for growth. And if you can continue to do more and more with your customers, they will generate more
revenue, you'll have more loyalty. And you're seeing that; you're seeing that in our retention metrics.
And so, we really look at our marketing spend. It's not just acquisition; it's also with our existing customer base.
And that's probably changed a little bit more over the years as we've invested more and more in our customers as
the product set that we have continues to expand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And Steve, one of the best examples of that last evolution you talked about is the fact that our member-get-
member program where our existing Card Members who are so attached to the brand that they get other Card
Members and friends to also get attached to the brand, that has come from almost nowhere a few years ago to
being one of our most significant acquisition channels, and I think it's a real commentary on everything you just
talked about.

No problem. Thanks. Yeah, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that this was one of the best quarters for
acquiring small business. And I wanted to tie that into an article that was out recently saying that you're going to
be working with Goldman Sachs to enable B2B for your clients. This is really in the corporate card, the top 250
companies globally that you work with. And in this article, it suggested that you would not be offering transaction
account directly from yourself, but you're tying-in with a partner to enable that. Maybe you could give us some
color as to how this offering is expected to drive business opportunities. Talk about the transaction account
banking piece of that. And then, if you could tie it into what you're seeing in SMB and what you could be offering
to SMB clients, too. That would be helpful. Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
So it's good to clarify this. So, look, we're very excited about the partnership with Goldman. And, look, we have
relationships with 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. And when we compete, as we compete, sometimes we
compete with other money center banks that have corporate card programs and also have transaction banking,
and they tend to integrate that. And so, Goldman is very interested in getting into transaction banking, not as
necessarily as interested in getting into the corporate card. We do a number of things with Goldman Sachs from a
customer perspective. They're a customer of ours, we're a customer of theirs. And as John and David and I were
talking about things, it looked like a really good opportunity. They were trying to ramp up their transaction banking.
We have the corporate card. And putting those things together in that space, a space that we really weren't going
to get into transaction banking as it related to large banks. It's just not our space, okay? Corporate card is, but not
transaction banking. So we decided to look at the top 250. And if that goes well, and there's no reason why it will
not go well, then we can put it a little bit more downstream to, say, the S&P 500.
We have a different perspective as it relates to the SMB space which is why if you remember, what we've talked
about from an SMB perspective is we wanted to be the working capital providers for our small businesses. And
now in the small business space, we have a very good footprint not only in the United States but good footprints
internationally. We also – remember, during the pandemic we bought Kabbage. And what is Kabbage? Kabbage
is basically a transaction banking platform, right? And so what Kabbage has, Kabbage does short-term loans, it
does working capital loans, merchant financing loans. It has a transaction banking account, it has a debit card
attached to it, and we have our American Express card attached to that. So we have a very different philosophy
as it relates to small businesses where the commitment of capital, the commitment of cash that we have to put out
and the commitment from a loan perspective will be much smaller and be much more diffused across the entire
SME base. And so, we believe it's a sweet spot for us, and that was the Kabbage piece of it. We did not believe
that transaction banking was a sweet spot for us from an S&P 500 and above, and we're really thrilled to be
partnering with Goldman on this.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you and good morning. I guess I wanted to follow-up, Steve and Jeff, on the SMB business and the
competitive environment in that space and your movements in adding additional products and services. There is a
lot more competition I guess from venture-backed companies like Brex and Divvy and Ramp, where you have
Divvy now part of your partner Bill.com. But how do you see – those companies are growing very fast and they're
providing, I think, spend management or business spend management services. How do you view that
competition relative to your SMB efforts? And are there additional products and services and ecosystem you're
building for your SMB clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, look, I mean, from an SME perspective, had a pretty good quarter, up 13%, so we feel pretty good about
that. And I think I'll just point you back to what I just responded to Betsy with. Obviously, we went out and bought
Kabbage, and Kabbage has – look, it has cash flow analysis on it, it has transaction banking, it has debit, it has
the ability to loan. So now, what you do is you take a fintech platform like Kabbage, you take American Express

with over 3 million small business customers and a sizable balance sheet and a sizable brand and a lot of
capabilities, you put that together, we believe it gives us a really great offering as it relates to our SMB base. And,
look, I'm not going to discount any of those, Ramp or Brex or Divvy or any – we never discount anybody and you
look to learn from people as well. But we believe that the combination of what we have and the space that we're
in, and putting together Kabbage and then also integrating into Kabbage acompay and our AP capabilities, our AP
automation capabilities, puts us in a very, very good position to continue to compete in this space and continue to
grow and continue to win.

Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Maybe we could touch on capital distribution a little bit. The buybacks for the quarter were well above, I
think more than double what the Street was expecting. Is that kind of level just more of a catch-up or do you
expect to have kind of an elevated level of capital return for the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, you are correct, Arren. It was quite elevated, probably our largest-ever quarter of share repurchase. And it's
really strictly a catch-up, right? This is our first quarter where we were completely free of any Fed constraints on
our buyback. We've been very clear for many years that our target CET1 capital ratio is 10% to 11%. As you all
know, that is actually well above the regulatory minimum. It's really more governed by our own view of the
balance sheet and the rating agency view of the balance sheet. So since the constraints from the Fed were lifted,
while we don't want to disrupt the market, we did buy more aggressively. I think you will continue to see us buy
above what I will call a steady-state level, and our steady-state level is pretty high as a company with a 30% ROE.
We generate a lot more capital than we need each year, but it'll stay elevated until you get back down into that
10% to 11% range which I'd expect to happen over the next couple of quarters.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. Look, I think when we look back at what's happened over the
last year, we really see the strength of the American Express franchise on the core business. And in a lot of ways,
things have stayed the same. I'm curious when you look forward, what do you think is different about the business
as we emerge from the COVID crisis? Is it the demographic of your customer? Is it the expansion with Kabbage?
What's going to be different in the next three years because of what we've seen in last year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think that if you look at sort of what's happened here, I think we've vetted down customers a lot more than
we've ever vetted them down in the past, and that was because we're really focused on a lot of this value
proposition enhancement. And one of the reasons that I started my remarks today with sort of pre-pandemic, at
pandemic and during the pandemic was to show that this was a bit of a continuum here, right? When you think
about this, what we talked about a number of years ago was really focusing in on our customers, focusing in on
refreshing our products and services, becoming more digitally engaged, and expanding that organic core of
15

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
products and services. And what I think what we saw during the pandemic here was that we saw an accelerant as
it related to online. Our online spending has accelerated tremendously; I think we're 27% up in Q3 here. Goods
and services, 19% growth over 2019. And so, we've been able to direct our Card Members in ways faster than we
probably would have gotten there without the pandemic.
And again, I think looking at our overall strategy of refreshing these card products has led us to expanding our
overall base. As we expand the value propositions, look, we're talking about over 70% millennial and Gen Z
acquisition in a Platinum Card where we just raised the fee to $695. So it's obviously speaking to that base, and I
think that's one of the things we've seen over this time period, is how much more we are speaking to that
customer segment. And so when you put that all together and you add the SME piece of it which is a complete
expansion with Kabbage is that we're opening up a lot more doors for us to do business with our SME customers.
And one of the things we've learned is that the more products that you have with your customer, the higher
retention rates that you have, obviously the more revenue that you have and the more engagement that you have.
And so, I think we've probably driven faster to where we thought we were going to get ultimately as a result of the
pandemic, but we haven't fundamentally changed where we were going. And that's why I wanted to start this
conversation this morning with this is a continuum for us. But again, like we've talked about in the environment,
online has been accelerated probably three years from a macroeconomic perspective, and I think we're seeing
our strategy that we were looking to continually implement, that has been accelerated and it's proven to be right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The one financial piece, Rick and Steve, I'd add to that that is very similar is that our funding structure has actually
changed quite significantly over the course of the pandemic to be more heavily weighted to our depository
products which are our lowest cost of funding. And when I project ahead through years, that trend is going to
continue. So that is actually, I think, perhaps a little noticed but very positive change for us as well when you look
a little longer-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. One other point that I'll just make, and not to beat on this, but when you look at the fact that we've – when
you look at our acquisition and you see where we are acquiring these Card Members, it has actually expanded
our playing field. And so with that playing field expanded, that's why you're seeing this broader marketing spend
because you have more customers to go after. You have more archetypes now that you can go after than you did
probably three or four years ago because the product is speaking to a broader set of consumers out there now,
broader in terms of demographic and broader in terms of age and so forth and wants and needs. The products
are all getting broader and a product can now appeal to multiple customer sets, and you're seeing differentiation
between the products. It's just not an upgrade. When you look at the Gold versus the Platinum, there is specific
differences here that speak to a different consumer or a different small business customer. So I think that has
probably changed as well.

you are there with your relationships? And I guess, would that include any cash conversion? I know it represents
inventories. Is most of that done on card anyway? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Look, I don't have sort of market share information on that. But sort of at the tip of my fingers here, but it is
– we think from a 13% growth perspective, we are probably growing at or above market at this particular point in
time. But when we look at this, what is down from an SME perspective is T&E, so you are seeing a conversion of
check or cash or wire to card. And I think we saw that during the pandemic, and I think that's where some of the
investment in sort of our AP automation has helped as well. And when you talk about B2B spending,
approximately 80% of SME spending is B2B spending. Maybe 85% of SME spending is B2B spending and they
use it for lots of different things; there's some inventory management. But remember, our SME base is so broad
and it's professional services, lawyers, HVAC, so forth and so on. And so, they do use – look, they do use the
product for goods for resale as well. I mean, auto glass companies use it to buy auto glass and plumbers use it to
buy supplies and so forth and so on. And you're probably seeing a little bit more cash conversion, but we're pretty
pleased with that 13% number of growth plus with the T&E component of that being down.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had another, like a follow-up question on the growth that
you're seeing in the millennials and Gen Zs that you called out on slide 5. Can you just take a step back and
comment a bit on what features and rewards specifically or like which card profiles that you're seeing are
particularly attracting those consumers? Like, how have you been this successful over the last couple of years?
And then also, can you give us any sense of the percentage of your US card base or some measure along those
lines that's currently in those younger cohorts? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So the last part, we don't really – we haven't – I don't know if we've disclosed the last point, but let me go with the
first point while they feverishly look for that answer, Lisa, as they're sitting around the table with me. But as far as
the first part, look, millennials and Gen Zs are about experiences, and they're about access, and I can speak from
experience having a house full of them. And so, they love to travel, they love to do things. And when you look at
the Platinum Card product which had always been positioned as, hey, I'm a real high spender, I need to have that
Platinum Card product, you have to look at the utility of this product. And you look at fine hotels and resorts and
you look at the value that you get out of a fine hotel and resort booking with an early check-in and a late check-out
or a free breakfast and $100 credit at the hotel. And then you look at streaming credits, they're online shoppers.
There's rewards accelerators, there's travel credits, there's access to tickets, there's access to special Card
Member events.
It is a range of services that they use. And look, Equinox is another benefit that we put on and, look, we just
added Walmart+ membership which a majority of our Platinum cardholders shop at Walmart, and we think this is
a great benefit as well. So when they look at this product, it really is a lifestyle product for them, one that ranges
from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming all the way to traveling and the credits they get,
whether it's global entry in TSA Pre and all those kinds of things. So it is a wide-ranging value-rich product for
these younger people and older people like myself. But basically, out of this particular cohort, it's 27% of our

overall spending, and in the third quarter that grew 38%, so we feel pretty good about that as we move. So I think
that gives you the answer to your second question.

Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about potential M&A. Are there sort of any areas in your
product set that might benefit from possibly bolt-on acquisitions? And then, has there been more opportunities to
engage in the fintech space or have high valuations continue to be a headwind to any sort of activity there? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I mean, look, let's take a little historical walk down memory lane. But we have – we bought Resy which was
a great bolt-on acquisition for us with dining and it becomes a great system for new Card Members because we
don't just limit Resy to our cardholders. And then, we added LoungeBuddy which is a lounge finder which
provides our Card Members not only with access to our Centurion lounges but other relationships that we have,
over 1,200 lounges, and will also give them perspective on if our lounges are full or not. Then, we bought Mezi
and we bought Cake and a few others, and then obviously Kabbage. So, look, we're constantly looking – and
acompay we bought as well. So we're constantly looking for those bolt-on acquisitions, things that will continue to
drive our overall organic core and make our overall product set better.
Some of the things are obviously, the prices for fintech are obviously, some of these things are very highly valued
and obviously, the math doesn't work. But the way we've looked at it is if something makes strategic sense
overall, then we'll look at doing it. But I think the big thing for us is we have a feeder system with AMEX Ventures
where we have probably investments in 40-plus, 50 different entities right now. And it gives us an opportunity to
test drive them, it gives us an opportunity to learn. And through some of these investments, it led to us acquiring
companies down the road. So, look, you never say never about anything and that's probably as far as I'm going to
go. But we're always interested in things that are going to be accretive to the company overall.

pay or integrating it into your rewards prop? And then also on a related matter, how are you thinking about
whether there's a role to play developing kind of a supplemental settlement layer to address interoperability
issues? And then finally, when should we expect you to buy a CryptoPunk?

Stephen J. Squeri A

So, look, we think about a broad range of digital currencies from crypto to stablecoins to government-backed
digital currencies. And, look, we think about cryptocurrency much more as an asset class at this particular point in
time. We don't use our card to sort of buy stock. People don't use our card to buy stock and I don't think people

are going to use our card any time soon to buy crypto. So I don't see that as a big role. Having said that, within
closed ecosystems of NFTs and stablecoins and things like that, you see it. I mean, we're on NBA Top Shot; you
can use the card there. And there's a few other places where you can use the card and we'll see how that all
plays out. I think there are opportunities down the road potentially, Membership Rewards and things like that as
redemption options.
But I don't see at this point, I don't foresee it at any point where cryptocurrency is going to be a threat to traditional
credit card payments, and there's a lot of reasons for that. Obviously, there's rewards, there's service, there is the
ability to dispute, and there's also the ability to extend credit. So there's always a role I think because I get asked
this question is it going to displace traditional credit cards, and I think the answer to that is no. I think there is a
role, though, for digital currencies. I think it can make cross-border payments a lot more seamless and a lot easier
to conduct, and so we'll see how government digital currencies and other stablecoins play out.

Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Can we look at the year-over-year improvement in goods and services? I guess is there a way to parse
apart how much of that is sort of your same-customer growth versus new customer growth versus inflation? I'm
just trying to think about how that cycles through when travel and entertainment comes back. I have one follow-up
after that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
All right. Well, we don't think there's a hell of a lot of inflation at this particular point in time. As far as new
customer, we're in a lot of new customers we acquired last year. And so same-customer sales are driving quite a
bit, but we don't – I don't have that at my fingertips at this point. But I think what I would say is that when we see –
what we've seen from a value proposition injection perspective last year, we saw a lot of that stuff stick. So we
saw more Card Members putting wireless on, we saw more Card Members putting streaming services on, and
that has continued to flow through. We've seen more of our Card Members putting online spending on.
So I think that our belief is that's going to stick. And when you look at sort of goods and services growth, it's 19%
over 2019, it's 18% over 2020, so it has been consistent. So I think that's here to stay and I think what'll happen is
we'll get that travel. The other thing I would say is we talked about the millennial cohort before and that being up
38%. Our boomers are not back, and so the majority of our traditional card base is not back yet and that is not
growing at 38%. But the reality is they will come back and they will come back as they feel more safe, and so we
think that's a tailwind for us going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's very helpful. And then I guess, Jeff, is there a way to be more specific on the provision next year?
I know it's going to be dependent on loan growth and the macro. But as you're thinking about what's embedded in
your expectations for the high end of the range, I mean, is it close to several billions of dollars? Maybe you can
just talk through that, please.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2021
Well, I think, Sanjay, the way to think about it is like many financial institutions, we are still holding an
appropriately but significant level of reserves driven by the uncertainty in the medical and economic environment.
At some point, that level of uncertainty is going to decrease down to zero, and at some point those reserves being
held for that have to also go pretty much down to zero. Now, so that's going to happen probably mostly over the
course of next year. On the other hand, as loan growth begins to pick back up, which it has in the last quarter, as
delinquencies start to drift up – I don't think they're going to spike up, but they'll drift up a little bit – then the actual
what I'm going to call BAU part of your provision is going to start to drift up.
What's really hard to predict though, Sanjay, is the relative pace of those two things next year. What I feel very
confident, though, in pointing out as I did a few minutes ago is that relative to this year where you had billions of
dollars that have led you to a net benefit on the provision line, I certainly don't expect that next year, which is why
we feel pretty good about the confidence in the range we've given given that it actually represents several billions
of dollars of improved business performance from a pre-provision perspective. But those are the dynamics that
we think about.

Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. So I'll close it out with a question on regulation, Jeff. A lot of things have been going well for
the company. Just want to check-in specifically on the US side and just see if you're feeling comfortable as you
can with the environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, Don, I'll answer it. I think we're as comfortable as we could be at this particular point in time for everything
that we know. But you're always worried about everything, and regulation is one of those things, but I think right
now, I think we're okay. And when we think about regulation, we specifically think about things that have
happened in Europe and things that happened in Australia and so forth, and we really don't see that happening in
the US. We'll see what happens as it relates to the CFPB and how that all plays out. But I think we've lived in this
environment a long time, we know how to operate in this environment, and I think we'll just be fine. But I don't see
any sort of curveballs, if you will, coming down the pike at this point. So that's what I have to say about it.
