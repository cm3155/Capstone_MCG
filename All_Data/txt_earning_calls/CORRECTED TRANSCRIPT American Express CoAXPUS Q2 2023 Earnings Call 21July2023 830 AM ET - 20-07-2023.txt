Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. This was the sixth
consecutive quarter of strong performance since we announced the growth plan in January of 2023. Revenues of
$15 billion grew 12% year-over-year, and reached a record high for the fifth straight quarter. Earnings per share of
$2.89 is also a quarterly record, and is also up 12% over last year. Based on our performance through the first
half, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year, of delivering revenue growth of 15% to 17%, and EPS of $11 to
$11.40. We also remain focused on achieving our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of
10%, and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady-state macro environment. I continue to feel very
good about our ability to achieve these long-term aspirations. Let me tell you why.
As I said on previous calls and at investor conferences, we have a business model that's differentiated from
others in the industry, which gives us some important advantages. Our business model is built largely around a
fee-based premium â€“ our fee-based premium products, which drive our expense-centric economics and produce
a fast-growing stream of subscription-like revenues. Spending is the largest contributor of revenues, while lending
plays a more modest role in our model. This revenue mix is a key differentiator for us. It all starts with our
premium customer base, which is built on our trusted brand. We have a global scale that's unmatched in the
industry and leadership positions with a diverse range of high-quality customers. We build long-term relationships
through our unique membership model, which we constantly evolve to attract new customers and grow with them
over time.

Our high-spending Card Members attract a wide [ph] array (00:03:38) of merchants and business partners, giving
our customers and partners even more reasons to stay with us, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth.
Partnerships play an important role in our model with a long history of partnering with brands who share our
values of backing customers with world-class products and services, and who value developing broad-based and
long-term relationships with us. Hilton is one of those long-standing partnerships. Our relationship started 70
years ago when we opened a travel office in a Hilton hotel in Madrid and grew it to a merchant relationship after
we began issuing cards, and then became our first co-brand partner in the 1990s. The partnership has lasted and
grown over time because we evolved together and put our customers at the center of what we do.
Today, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed a 10-year extension of our relationship with Hilton which
includes continuing as the exclusive co-brand issuer of Hilton consumer and small business cards in the United
States as well as extensions of our travel and merchant relationships. This extension builds on the strong
foundation we built over the years with Hilton and gives us a long runway to invest in products and services and
[ph] experiences (00:04:47) that attract new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones. It's a
great example of the strength of our business model in that it touches virtually all aspects of our business,
providing our customers and our partner with exceptional value. Our philosophy of making continuous strategic
investments in our business model is what's driving our growth today and it's the way we plan to run our business
going forward.
For our second quarter performance, the power of our differentiated model can be seen in our results. Card
Member spending hit another all-time high in the quarter with US consumers and Card Members outside the US
both up by double digits which offset some softness in US small business. Millennial and Gen Z consumers
continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our Card Member base with US billings up 21% in the quarter. Of
particular note, you'll recall our International Card business was our fastest-growing segment for several years
prior to the pandemic, and it's again the fastest-growing. We continue to see strong growth in travel and
entertainment spending which increased by double digits in the quarter and remain strong across customer
categories and geographies. Q2 was a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our Resy platform and
bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest level since before the pandemic.
We also saw continued strong demand for our premium products in the quarter with over 70% of the new
accounts we acquired on fee-based products, and more than 60% of new customer accounts acquired globally
are coming from millennials and Gen Zs. While the number of new accounts is important, we pay particular
attention to the quality and potential revenues they represent. And when you look at the accounts we've acquired
over the last year compared to those we acquired over a comparable period pre-pandemic, the overall revenue
being generated by these new accounts is up substantially over 2019. Importantly, we continue to be thoughtful
about who we grow with and how, and you see that in our results. Our credit metrics remain best-in-class
supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our robust risk management capabilities, and the
thoughtful underwriting actions we take on an ongoing basis that we've discussed with you on these calls over the
last several quarters.
Before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to take a couple minutes to talk about our CFO transition. As we announced last
month, Jeff will be stepping down as our CFO on August 14, at which time our Deputy CFO, Christophe Le
Caillec, will become CFO of the company. First, I want to recognize Jeff and thank him for his outstanding tenure
as our CFO for the past decade. He's been an invaluable partner and friend to me and to American Express
throughout his time at the company. Jeff's insights, strategic acumen and calm, focused approach has helped us
navigate through numerous challenges, including the unprecedented COVID pandemic, while strengthening the

company's overall financial position and the flexibility of our business model. Jeff is a person of exceptional
integrity and our company is stronger today because of him.
While Jeff will officially be stepping down as CFO in mid-August, he'll be staying on as our Vice Chairman until
next March, during which time he'll be available to me, Christophe, and our executive committee as we work on
many of the important matters facing the company. Jeff, I speak for all of us at American Express when I say that
it's truly been an honor and a pleasure working with you as our CFO these last 10 years. I also want to welcome
Christophe who has been a trusted partner to our leadership team and a key contributor to our company's growth
for 25 years. As our Deputy CFO, Christophe works closely with our executive committee, Jeff, and me to drive
our financial strategy and performance. Over his tenure, he has served in finance leadership roles across the
company. Christophe has gained a deep knowledge of all aspects of our business and his experience and
thoughtful analysis play a key role in our strategic decision-making. I'm sure you will all enjoy getting to know him.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Jeff for his 85th earnings call as a public company CFO and his 41st and final call
as the CFO of American Express.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our second quarter results
which are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full-year and reflects steady progress against our long-term
growth aspirations. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2, our second quarter revenues were $15.1
billion, reaching a record high for the fifth straight quarter, up 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. This
revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.89, up 12% year-over-
year. This does represent a quarterly EPS record for the company and it also reflects the sequential strengthening
we expected as we move through the year that I mentioned last quarter. Pre-tax pre-provision income was $3.9
billion, up 33% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the strong growth momentum in our underlying
earnings.
So now, let's get into a more detailed look at our results which, in our spend-centric business model, always
begins with a look at volumes which you see on slides 3 through 7. In total, you've seen on slide 3 that we did
reach a new record level for spending on our network this quarter with total network volumes and billed business
up 9% and 8% year-over-year respectively on an FX-adjusted basis. Of course, I'd remind you the growth rates
were particularly elevated last quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in the first quarter of the prior year. We
are now seeing the more stable rates that we expect are more representative of the kind of growth rates we will
see in the balance of the year. Goods and services spending grew 6% overall in the second quarter. We saw
good growth in goods and services spending in US consumer and International Card Services with 8% and 15
respectively, while the growth rate in US SME did continue to slow down a bit further from last quarter.
In contrast, we saw very strong growth in travel and entertainment spending across geographies and customer
types, up 14% overall, driven by sustained demand for travel and dining experiences. Looking forward, I would
expect this growth rate to remain in the double-digits through the rest of this year. Turning to our largest segment,
US Consumer grew billings strongly at 10% this quarter. Millennial and Gen Z customers continued to drive our
highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing 21% year-over-year. You see our
highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services with strong growth across both geographies and
customer types. Spending from international consumers grew 16%, while spending from international SME and
large corporate customers grew 19%. This strength in spending growth from our US consumers and Card
Members outside the US offset the continued softness in US SME spending growth that we have been talking
about for the past few quarters.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Looking at Commercial Services, US SME growth came in at 2% this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to
monitor these spending trends. Our US large and global corporate customers also grew billings 2% in the second
quarter. As we've said for many years, these customers, while not a particular growth driver for our business, do
remain an important foundation for the company's business model. Taking all of this into account, spending
volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable
growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic. Now, moving on to loans and Card Member
receivables on slide 8. We saw good continued sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth of 15%. Year-
over-year growth moderated a bit this quarter, as we expected, but remains elevated versus pre-pandemic levels.
The interest-bearing portion of our loan and receivable balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth
you see as our customers continue to rebuild balances.
Importantly, the majority of this revolving loan growth in the US continues to come from our high credit quality
existing customers. We also included a disclosure this quarter showing that only 8% of our US Card Member
loans and receivables comes from customers with a FICO less than 660. As you then turn to credit and provision
on slides 9 through 11, this high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class
credit performance. Our Card Member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-
pandemic levels. Delinquency rates remained flat quarter-over-quarter, while write-off rates continued to move up
a bit this quarter as we expected, as you can see on slide 9. Going forward, as we've talked about for many
quarters now, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are
likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide 10. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan
balances was the primary driver of our $327 million bill. There was also a small component from incorporating a
slightly worse macroeconomic outlook this quarter, relative to last quarter. This reserve build combined with net
write-offs drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the second quarter. As you see on slide 11, we ended the
second quarter with $4.7 billion of reserves, representing 2.6% of our total loans and Card Member receivables.
This reserve rate remains about 30 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day one CECL. We
continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, while also reflecting the continued
premiumization of our portfolio. Moving next to revenue on slide 12. Total revenues were up 13% year-over-year
in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 8% year-over-
year in Q2 as you can see on slide 13, driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier.
Net card fee revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can
see on slide 14. Growth remains quite strong and continues to be driven largely by bringing new accounts on to
our fee-paying products. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards and the spend revenue and credit profiles
of these acquisitions continued to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. Importantly, the acquisition
trends you see on slide 14 in this and recent quarters are consistent with our long-term growth aspirations.
Moving on to slide 15. You can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year, driven primarily by the
growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up, on revenues on slide 16, we're seeing broad-based revenue
growth across our revenue lines. We're tracking with our expectations, so looking forward, we still expect to see
revenue growth within our range of 15% to 17% for the full year of 2023.
The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made, and those
investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement
expenses, these costs came in at 42% total revenues in the second quarter, and are tracking with our expectation
for them to run at around 43% of total revenues on a full-year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.4
billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to have full-year marketing spend of around $5.5 billion. We
6

remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow slower than revenues, while continuing
to drive the high-quality [ph] new bookings (00:17:50) that Steve discussed earlier. Moving to the bottom of slide
17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.4 billion in the second quarter, also tracking with our
expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year.
This quarter, you see that, as we expected, we have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high-level of revenue
growth. And looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital on
slide 18. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock
purchases of $1.1 billion and $446 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings
generation. Now, as you know, this is an off-cycle year for Amex as a CCAR bank, but let me briefly remind you of
our capital management approach. We generally increase our dividend roughly in line with earnings and targeted
20% to 25% payout ratio, and you saw us do that as we increased our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share last
quarter. We target a CET1 ratio between 10% and 11%, and we ended the second quarter in the middle of that
range at 10.6%. As we think about the potential finalization of Basel III, I'd remind you that our 10% to 11% CET1
target range is actually well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%.
We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet
growth, and we don't expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach, driven by the
evolution of these rules. So, that then brings us to slide 19 and the growth plan. To step back for a minute, I joined
American Express 10 years ago in 2013, because I was excited about the long-term growth prospects for the
company. Today, as I join you for my last earnings call, I'm actually even more excited about those growth
prospects. Steve and I first introduced our new multiyear growth aspirations back in January of 2022. And I would
point out that Christophe was in the room for every key decision we made as we developed that plan with the
senior business leaders across Amex. Now, in July of 2023, we have consistently achieved the aspirations we set
out six quarters ago, thanks to the great efforts of our 77,000 colleagues across American Express. So, we are re-
confirming today our 2023 full-year revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth with EPS in the range of $11 to
$11.40.
Our revenue momentum and customer acquisition trends are positioning us well for our growth aspirations this
year in 2024 and beyond. So this momentum, combined with this being my 85th consecutive earnings call across
three industries without a break, makes this a good time for me to transition the CFO role to Christophe.
With that, I'll ask Christophe to say a few words before Steve and I take your questions.

Christophe Le Caillec

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, Jeff. You've had quite a run at American Express. You've been very
helpful throughout your tenure and I'm sure you will be in your remaining position. Christophe, I look forward to
working with you. My first question is on billed business growth. Obviously, there's so much noise over the last
couple of years and even in this year. And I'm just â€“ Jeff, you talked about stabilization going forward and
expecting that. Could you just talk about what gives you the confidence that you see that stabilization because
we're still a little bit above trend in terms of that growth? And then, what you need in the back half to get to that
growth guidance on revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, gosh, I guess I don't particularly, Sanjay, see us above trend. What gives us confidence is looking at what has
actually happened in our business over the course of this year. In the first quarter, you were clearly lapping
Omicron and that was, in some ways, I think the last of the pandemic-driven noise in our results. As you got into
the second quarter, we have seen stabilization across geographies at a level that I would suggest is actually
consistent with being in a pretty low-growth economy. And what you're hearing from us is with the kind of volume
growth that you see this quarter, which we think has stabilized, which we think will continue, that is consistent with
both the guidance we provided for this year as well as with our longer-term growth aspirations. I would point out at
some point, the economy is likely to get stronger. But even with the economy in its current kind of low-growth
state, the volume growth that we're seeing now allows us to achieve what we have been committing to for six
quarters now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. And look, I mean, just look at consumer, right? I mean, consumer in the US is up at 10%. T&E is still very,
very strong. We talked about travel bookings. Travel bookings more than one month out are higher than they've
been pre-pandemic. They were higher than they were at this time last year, they were higher than they were
obviously in 2019. International is really coming back strong for us and, as we said, it's the fastest-growing part of
our business. And the other thing I'll point out is you had a little hangover of noise from Omicron in this quarter
because last year, you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter.
And if you look at â€“ if you go back and look sequentially last year, it was a huge increase sequentially quarter-
over-quarter, so we feel really good about it. I mean, it's hard to apologize for record billings. And as Jeff said, it's
the billings we need to hit our growth plan, so we feel really good about it.
And the other point I'll just reiterate again is that, look, we're in a low-growth economy right now. We're still out
there acquiring Card Members. Credit is really good. Our base is changing in terms of more millennials and Gen Z
who grow with us. And as the economy gets better, we expect spending to pick up, so we feel really confident.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in the future. And Christophe, I'm looking forward to
working with you in the future. Maybe to drill down into two areas that were highlighted on the call. First,
commercial. Obviously, we've seen a big slowdown there to 2% year-over-year growth. Steve, maybe just talk
about what's driving the slowdown and what do we need to see for a re-acceleration? And maybe just drill a little
bit further on T&E in terms of your confidence. Like, it seems like sequentially it may have slowed a little bit, but I
take the point that year-over-year growth rates are still strong. So can you maybe just talk about what you see as
the key drivers of that remaining in double-digits? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I mean, from a T&E perspective, and I think you just have to listen to our friends at Delta and what Ed had
said, I mean, they're seeing record growth. And for us, we're seeing â€“ we have a line of sight into future bookings.
And so when you look at, sort of, consumer T&E, restaurant â€“ not only is airline bookings up, but if you look at
what's going on with restaurants in terms of Resy, I mean, restaurant is probably not the biggest segment that we
have in T&E. We have all other, but we'll wind up disaggregating that. They grew 15%. And so, we have really
strong T&E growth. And I think that people are just back traveling. And so, the line of sight into what we see from
Resy and the activity we see on Resy from a restaurant perspective, from the activity that we see in our consumer
travel business, we feel really [indiscernible] (00:27:42) about that. As far as small business and corporate, look, I
think let's talk about large corporate first.
I think large corporate, it's crawling its way back is the best way to describe it. It is a small piece of our business.
It's about 5% of our business right now. It's an important piece of our business. And we value all the corporate
relationships that we have, but as many of us know, the first step is to get people into [indiscernible] (00:28:14).
And the second step is to get them out on to the road. And I think what you're seeing a little bit less of is those
one-stop trips, that quick hop to London to meet with that one client or that quick sort of run across the country to
have an internal meeting. You're seeing less of that. So, I think that will continue to come back. We continue to be
aggressive obviously at retaining those customers, and aggressively acquiring new customers, but I think that's
going to be slower. I don't think that's coming back as fast, which is a contrast to consumer.
As far as small business goes, I think when we look at small business, I think the biggest thing there from a small
business perspective is really the organic growth. I think organic growth has slowed. I don't think that's an Amex
phenomenon. I think that's a little bit of an industry phenomenon. And I think small businesses grew very, very
rapidly, and I think they have slowed down. What we have focused in on from a small business perspective is
making sure we're continuing to acquire more small business customers, continuing to meet the other needs that
they have, which are some lending needs for existing customers and also their deposit needs. And so as we grow
both aspects of those business, and as when they're ready to grow again, we'll be ready to grow judiciously with
them, and that's what we're focused on.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
So, look, would we prefer that our SME business was growing like our consumer business? Sure, we would. But
there are these cycles, and at this particular point in time, I think you're seeing a little bit of an industry-wide
slowdown from a small business perspective, but again, just to pick up on Jeff's point from before, after the slow
down comes a recovery, so we'll be poised for that.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Hi, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And, Jeff, all the best. It's been great working with you. And, Christophe, looking forward to meeting you and
working with you as well. I did just want to make sure I understood the guide on the rev outlook here, because
what I'm hearing -and tell me where I'm wrong. What I'm hearing is that billings growth you're anticipating
something similar to what you generated this quarter on a year-on-year basis for the second half of this year. And
that's a little bit of a slower pace obviously than the rev guide of 15% to 17%. Clearly, 1Q was very strong well-
above that. So, I'm just trying to understand if the other lines in revenue are going to more than make up for that,
i.e., net interest income, maybe you could speak to that a little bit or some of the other fee lines that drive your
outlook for the 15% to 17% for the full-year rev guide. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So, I think it's an important question, Betsy, but if you really just look at this quarter, the thing I would point out is
you do have some unusual noise in the service fees and other revenue line, when you look at our slide 12 in the
slide deck, because in the prior year, we had a complicated litigation settlement that drove some unusual
movement in that line. What we're really saying is that we are in a low growth economy, but it is consistent with
the objectives we've set, if you maintain the volume growth that we have, and then combine it with the kind of
consistent high-growth in that card fees that you've seen right through the pandemic grew 21% this quarter. If you
combine it with the fact that you still have customers rebuilding balances a little bit on the net interest income side,
and you take the noise out on the service fee and other revenue side, you then easily get to a number that is very
consistent in the back half of the year with what we've guided for the full year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
And I think here is a great example of the model, right? I mean it's a great example of the three-legged stool.
We've got â€“ card fee growth is very, very strong. I mean it's a third â€“ I think it's the third straight quarter we've had
of 20% card fee plus growth. Yeah, we're benefiting a little bit from net interest income. As Jeff said, there's noise
in the services fee and other revenue and that will shift, but yeah, we feel comfortable with billings around where

we are today to make that revenue guidance, because of the three tiers of revenue that we have, so that's what
gives us confidence.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Jeff. I often say this in these circumstances, a little bit tongue and cheek that
we're going to miss you more than you're going to miss us, but I think that's absolutely true here. It's been a
pleasure working with you over the years and, Christophe, we're looking forward to getting to know you as well. I
do â€“ Betsy really sort of pulled on the thread that I'm interested pursuing as well, but would love to sort of think
about this a little bit more. When we looked at the deceleration of top line in the second quarter, if revenue stays
on that trajectory for the second half of the year, it sort of puts you at the low-end of your top line guidance. It
sounds like there's a little bit of noise that gives you some confidence, but I'm curious fundamentally, do you think
we will see some acceleration in the back half to sort of offset any potential risks, if you just look at the trend line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
We still feel really confident that we'll be within the 15% to 17%, and there's really not a lot more to say other than
that. So, you have a little â€“ as I said, you have a little bit of deceleration from a billings perspective, but it's a
record quarter of billings, over $420 billion of billings. And so, again, we feel very confident of the 15% to 17% and
we'll see where it winds up landing within that range, but that's the reason we give ranges.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Thank you very much. And, Jeff, thank you for your help and good luck to you. Christophe, welcome.
Look forward to meeting you. I'd like to ask about your views on credit normalization, kind of a trend in credit
normalization. As you look at your portfolio, what we should expect as we look at the aspirations for 2024, so the
â€“ I mean the back half of 2023 is pretty baked, but just as we think about that going into 2024 and onward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think the most important point to make there, Bob, is that we have a portfolio today that is more premium
and stronger than what we had in 2019 in day one CECL. That is why we added the additional disclosure this
quarter around these small percentage of our portfolio that it is in the band where you do see challenges, and
that's the FICO band below 660. So, we feel really good about where we are from a credit perspective in this
environment. I think we feel really good about the fact that when you look sequentially, you actually saw
delinquencies flat. There is complexity in the CECL calculation, when you try to do comparisons across
companies. I did make the observation that the way and with the timing of how we do ours, we actually
incorporated a slightly worse economic outlook this quarter than we did last quarter. Sitting here on July 20, I think
most people would say things of perhaps gotten a bit more optimistic in recent days, but we'll have to see how
that influences things.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
At the core though, we feel really good about the product choices, the acquisition choices, and the risk
management choices we've made, which leave us confident that we will be below this year on credit metrics, all of
the places we were in 2019, and absent some dramatic change in the economy, and I think we feel good about
what that means for 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, FTP Securities LLC
Yeah, good morning. Jeff, for meeting you in the middle of an ice storm until now, I appreciate all the help over
the years. And, Christophe, looking forward to meeting you soon. So, my question â€“ my two questions really are
around, one, SME, just wanted to dig in a little further there. If you could help me understand if there was a
meaningful difference in growth between the total number, and if you just looked at it on the same business
activity level and took out the new business ads? And second, has there been any real difference in credit
vintages? We've recently seen some data on consumer loans that have shown a real deterioration in recent
vintages of loans, so wanted to ask about that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so for the second question first, the answer is no. It's really not, but, Jeff, do you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, with the only color, I'd remind you over the course of the past year, Craig, we have talked about the fact that
we have consistently made some adjustments from a risk management perspective. And I think that is part of
why, as Steve says, we just don't see any change from a vintage perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
As far as line of sight into SME, I mean, the way to think about it is, organic is probably flat. You obviously had
businesses that go out of business, and so you have a little bit of sort of same [indiscernible] (00:38:59) that go
away, but the acquisition is still relatively strong, so think about organic is having a neutral impact. Think about
attrition, because attrition has a negative impact, but no different than what we've seen over the last few years,
and then acquisition in there. I think the biggest difference is really organic. And what you saw through the
pandemic is you saw small businesses continue to add and add and add. And you got to remember, small
businesses use a card to run their entire business, and so there was a lot of buying ahead from a goods and
services perspective, from an inventory perspective, and so we're going to watch it really closely in terms of have
they finally gotten to sort of full stock and what have you. And I think that's the way to think about those three
components. Organic basically, flat; acquisition, up; and attrition, pretty much stable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.

Hey. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. You guys highlighted that it is now six quarters since you
introduced the structural increase in your long-term plan to double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS

growth. A lot's happened in the last six quarters; we're kind of finally returning to normal after the pandemic. So,
can you just highlight when you look at the underlying business drivers required to sustain that model on an
ongoing basis, what is sort of doing better than you expected, maybe where do you need to make some
adjustments, et cetera? Just kind of comment on how that strategy and your thoughts about that has evolved as
you look forward now coming back into a more normalized economy. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Well, I think you got to go back to sort of strategic priorities we always talk about which is focused on
premium consumer, we're focused on small business, and we're focused on coverage. If I look at this, I would say
that international has come back probably even a little quicker than we had thought within our three-year horizon.
I think millennials are playing out even better than what we had thought both from an acquisition perspective and
a spending perspective. I think when you think about boomers, I think they've been slower to return but it
becomes a smaller piece of our business over time. Corporate, I think that's an opportunity going forward from a
growth perspective. And I think small business started out in the beginning â€“ small business winded up being a
tale of three cities over this time horizon. I think it was really, really strong for us last year. I think it's a little bit
more muted. It's a little bit more muted and I think it'll probably pick up.
And the other thing that's been different when we started with this plan, it was done in a much slower â€“ it was
done â€“ we anticipated a more robust economy. So, what really makes us feel good about this is that we've
accomplished this in a slow-growth environment. We've stayed true to who we are from a credit quality
perspective. And the last thing that I'll add is I think we've made some really great coverage gains over this period
of time as we continue to march to our goals, especially international where I think the team has done a really
good job from a coverage perspective. And when you think about our longer-term partnerships here, we really
cemented in our key partnerships over the long-term here. Obviously, with Delta and with [ph] Hilton (00:42:39).
We still have Marriott and BA which go out still a number of years, so we feel good about it.
And the interesting part about this is did it play out exactly as we thought it was going to play out? No, but the
flexibility in the model has enabled it to go where we wanted it to go and I think we really got off to a tremendous
start in 2022 with tremendous revenue growth. I mean, when we did this three-year plan, we did not project 25%
revenue growth last year. We were at 17% to 19% I believe when we started the year, then we took it up to 19%
to 21%, and then you got 25%. So, if you think about sort of where we thought we were going to be, we're ahead
of where we thought we were going to be longer-term. And the 15% to 17% guidance that we provided at the
beginning of this year was based off of original guidance that was 17% to 19%, so we're growing over bigger
numbers and that's why I feel really good about it, and so we'll continue. And I think the most important thing for
us is to stay focused and to focus on our priorities, and I think the team has done a really good job of that.
And you have to remember, and you guys all know this, this is a very good industry to be in. And when you play in
this industry the way we play in it, across three different dimensions of card fees, of billings, and of net interest
income, it makes our model completely differentiated from our competitors.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Thanks. Your marketing expense pulled back a bit this quarter. You still have high customer acquisitions. How are
you thinking about marketing expenses going into the second half of the year? And if you could provide a, kind of,
quarter-to-date update in terms of your growth rate of billed business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
We're not going to do a quarter-to-date update of billed business. We're kind of 20 days in, so there's no real
change. But in terms of marketing, the only thing that's important to know is that we said we'd spend about $5.5
billion on marketing; that's our plan, to continue to do that. How it winds up, sort of, moving from quarter-to-
quarter, I think we're probably $100 million from last year or something like this in this particular quarter, but it all
depends on the programs we're running and the timing and everything else. And so, a week here or a week there
can make all the difference in the world sometimes. When you think about spending $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion in a
quarter, it's like $100 million sort of a week. So, bottom line is we are committed to go after all the great
opportunities that are out there and we believe that we'll wind up spending about $5.5 billion from a marketing
perspective. And just to remind everybody, the marketing spend for us is predominantly customer acquisition,
right, and affiliate fees and incentives and things like that.
It's not sort of TV and print and just kind of advertising. That's what that marketing spend is, and that's why it can
vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer and Co. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey. Great. Thanks so much for the question. So, I was just wondering, when you think about your aspirational
revenue target, has the thought process on the contribution to growth from net card fees to total revenue changed
over time where its potentially providing more of a boost towards that 10% revenue goal versus the past â€“ versus
discount rate revenue? Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, look, I think one of the big differentiators for us is that card fee. I mean, you think about that as sort of
subscription SaaS kind of revenue, and we're really pleased with that, but no, I mean, it's in the ballpark of what
we thought it was going to be as we put together our aspirations, right? I mean â€“ and so, when you look at this
20% three quarters in a row is a big number. And the other thing I'd point out, during the pandemic, it was growing
in double-digits, and so which is â€“ it's a big contributor and it's obviously a higher â€“ it has higher growth than
discount revenue would, but it's pretty much in line with where we thought we were going to be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
I just can't resist adding, Dominick, it, for something that grew in double-digits all through the pandemic, has had
really high growth rates the last year, it is going to continue to grow to be an ever-bigger part of our revenue
[indiscernible] (00:47:56). And I think that is a key strength of the company. It really ties customers and engages
customers with us and the product, and is a critical part to the overall model.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Just one other thing, because Jeff just sort of reminded me as he said that. When we talked about sort of this
10% â€“ this double-digit growth during the pandemic, it really speaks to how we think about our customers over the
long-term, because if we had not invested in our customers during the pandemic, you would not have seen that
double-digit growth during the pandemic or coming out of the pandemic. It was really important to embrace those
customers. It would have been easier to drop more money to the bottom line rather than to put more money into
our existing customers, but that's not how we run the company. And we were thinking much more from a long-
term perspective, and by really investing in the value propositions, because as you all remember those value
propositions from a travel perspective were challenged fast. And to put other things in there, it really helped to
cement those relationships, which kept those fees going, but more important, dropped just normal attrition that we
had because we improved our retention rates over the course of the pandemic.
So, I think it speaks to the membership model, because this card fee is a decision that our members make to join
the franchise, and that's really important, because that means they see value in the product, they see ongoing
value in the product, and it's our job and we'll continue to do this to continue to insert more values into the
product. And that's what keeps this thing going. And that's why, from a strategic perspective, the consistent
refreshing of our products is really, really important to our strategy.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Congratulations, Jeff and Christophe. Jeff, I wanted to clarify on the Basel comment, are you saying you
won't have to run at a higher CET1 than your target of 10% to 11%? I know there was some concern around fees
being looked at differently. Wonder if you can clarify that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Don, you were cutting out a little bit, but I think you're asking about the CET1 target in Basel III. And the point I
was trying to make is you need to remember a few things here. Our 10% to 11% CET1 target is actually more
driven by our own view and rating agency views versus the regulatory constraints, because our regulatory
minimum has long been only 7%. That's the first point. The second point to remember is we have a return on
equity of over 30%, so our ability to quickly replenish capital whenever we need to, without frankly taking more
than a brief pause from share repurchase, is very high. Third, I know there's been a lot of attention paid to
different iterations of the Basel III endgame, particularly around ops risk. I guess I'd also just remind people, ops
risk is only one component. There are other components that probably have some positives and probably have
some negative impacts on us, so I guess we'll have to see whenever the final rules come out.
We've been waiting for them for â€“ I feel like much of my tenure here, but when they come out hopefully later this
month â€“ and the devil's in the details here, but I think my overarching message is we don't see it as a material
event for this company, because it's certainly a possible outcome that there's no change in our target and even a
modest change in our target with a 30%-plus ROE is not going to have any material impact on share repurchase
or the trajectory of our EPS growth that we've laid out in the growth plan.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you for taking my questions, and good morning. Congratulations, Jeff. Thank you for all your help. And
welcome, Christophe. I look forward to getting to know and working with you. Wanted to switch gears a little bit
and talk about the process revenues of the network partnerships. I think the old G&S business. It seems like
there's been a little bit of momentum in terms of signing some new partners recently. I believe this quarter we
actually saw the launch of the Square card, and processed volumes grew faster than billed business this quarter.
So, just wondering if you could talk about that business a little bit more. Has there been something â€“ has
something changed internally? Are you focused more on that segment? What's driving that momentum? Thank
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, no, I don't think anything has changed. I think these are â€“ it's always been something that we have been
focused on, but to switch or to get a partner to come on to the network is a big deal. And there are technical
hurdles to wind up crossing. And the G&S team is out there on a consistent basis looking for new partners. And
when you think about our overall model, we're really operating around 29 proprietary countries. All the rest of the
markets that we operate around the world are G&S markets, either just from a card acceptance perspective, or
from a both card acceptance and a card issuing perspective. And there's been a lot of work going on with G&S
over the years to get to increasingly get more and more coverage. And so, when you look at our improvements in
coverage, so much of that's been driven by our G&S partners. And just to remind you that everything that we're
doing in China is really â€“ it really comes under the heading of G&S, because we're in there just as a network.
We don't acquire merchants. We don't issue cards. We have a joint venture and that's a G&S relationship. And
look, our launch of our card, I mean, with Square, that's been in the pipeline for a long time, but if you aren't in
cards or if you're issuing Visa, MasterCards, it's a little bit different to hook up to our systems to get priority within
your own system and so forth. So, we've been out there on a consistent basis working to get partners. I think the
Square one has a little bit more â€“ I guess a little bit more headlines because it's a US partnership, but the team is
out there on a real consistent basis all across Asia and South America and Africa and so forth, really thinking
through how we continue to get more coverage and how we get more cards issued. So, while you may see it a
little bit more, I can tell you that the team has been working really hard at this for a lot of years.
