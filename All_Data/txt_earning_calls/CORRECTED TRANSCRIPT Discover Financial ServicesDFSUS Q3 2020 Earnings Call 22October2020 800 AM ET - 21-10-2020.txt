Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. Good afternoon. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this
time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings
Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers'
remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig A. Streem
Vice President-Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's call. We will begin this morning on slide 2 of
our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that
appear in today's earnings press release and presentation.
Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During
the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. And if you have a follow-up, please queue back in so we
can accommodate as many participants as possible.
Now, as always, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In these uniquely challenging times, I'm pleased
with Discover's results and how well our business model has performed. In the third quarter, we earned $771
million after-tax, or $2.45 per share.
We clearly benefited from the actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees, manage credit risk
and control costs, while preserving momentum on long-term investments. While significant uncertainty remains as
to the extent and timing of a recovery, we were pleased to see the return to year-over-year sales growth in
September.
Managing credit remains a top priority. We entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our
traditionally conservative approach to underwriting, as well as actions taken over the past few years to reduce our
contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin. We quickly implemented changes to credit policy at the onset
of the pandemic, including tightening criteria for new accounts and line increases and additional income
verification.
While we saw a very strong credit performance this quarter, we expect to see deterioration in the coming
quarters, as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent, white-collar unemployment. That

said, we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and don't see the need to make significant changes
at this time.
The improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter, with a return to growth in the month of
September. Sales have improved across all categories, with particular strength in online retail, home improvement
and everyday spend categories, partially offset by continued weakness in travel and entertainment spending.
Loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic, with total loans down 4% year-over-year, including card
loans down 6% and personal loans down 5%. The drop in spending during the pandemic and our own credit
tightening has impacted loan growth, but another driver has been a significantly higher payment rate in our card
and personal loan portfolios. Consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending in
government stimulus and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their
loans.
In our student loan business, originations in the peak season were down year-over-year, reflecting the large
number of students who chose not to enroll this fall. Even in this challenging environment, our organic student
loans were up 7%, reflecting innovative features like our multi-year loan and our strong competitive position. In
terms of operating expenses, we remain on track to deliver $400 million of cost reductions this year, while
continuing to invest in core capabilities such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive long-term
value.
In conclusion, this quarter, our business generated high returns, as we've remained focused on disciplined credit
management, profitable growth and an industry-leading customer experience supported by our 100% US-based
customer service. The economic environment remains uncertain, but our strong capital and liquidity and the
actions we have taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive long-term value for our
shareholders.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.

John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll walk through our results starting on
slide 4. We earned $2.45 per share, driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and significantly lower
operating expenses. While total revenue was down from last year, reflecting the slowdown in the economy, sales
volume turned positive in September and net interest margin expanded nicely.
Net interest income was down 6%, as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower funding costs.
In addition, average receivables were down 3%, contributing to the decline in net interest income. Non-interest
income was down 10%, driven by lower fee income, reflecting fewer late fee instances and the impact of lower
overall spending on cash advance fees. The decrease in net discount and interchange revenue was driven by
sales volume in the quarter.
The provision for credit losses improved by nearly $50 million from the prior year, as a result of a decline in net
charge-offs and a lower reserve build. Operating expenses were down 9% year-over-year, driven by marketing
expenses and professional fees.
Turning to loan growth on slide 5, total loans were down 4% from the prior year, driven by a 6% decrease in card
receivables. Lower card receivables were driven by three factors: a higher payment rate as customers continue to

be mindful of their debt obligations; a decline in promotional balances as a result of credit tightening, which will
benefit net interest margin going forward; and third, lower sales volume.
In the quarter, sales were down just 1% on a year-over-year basis. Sales returned to growth in September, up 4%
year-over-year with improvement in all categories. Grocery, retail and home improvement were very strong. The
trend continued through the first half of October, with sales up 7%. In our other lending products, organic student
loans increased 7% from the prior year, and personal loans decreased 5%.
Moving to slide 6, our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved 38 basis points to
10.19% in the current quarter. Relative to the second quarter, NIM increased primarily due to favorable consumer
deposit pricing. Since June 30, we have decreased our online savings rate 41 basis points, down to 0.60%.
Approximately two-thirds of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity accounts, primarily savings, which
has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rates decreases. Average consumer deposits were up 22% year-
over-year and up $2.7 billion from the second quarter.
Looking at slide 7, you can see how our funding mix has changed over time. We're also providing details on our
funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years. Given our current excess liquidity
position, we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near term. The majority of our new deposits have
been in online savings, and we would expect this trend to continue in the current low rate environment. As we
move towards our target at 70% to 80% of funding from consumer deposits, we expect to see continued benefits
to net interest margin.
Turning to slide 8, total operating expenses were down $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Marketing and
business development expense was down $90 million or 39%. The bulk of the reduction was in brand marketing
and card acquisition. Professional fees decreased $38 million or 20%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery
fees related to court closures, as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments.
Employee compensation was up $32 million or 7%, driven by staffing increases, mainly in technology, as well as
higher average salaries and benefit costs. To date, we've realized approximately 90% of the targeted $400 million
of expense reductions we discussed over the past two quarters. We're on track to deliver the remaining 10% in
the fourth quarter and continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities.
Turning now to slide 9, showing credit metrics; credit performance remained very strong in the third quarter. Card
net charge-off dollars actually came down $7 million, while the rate increased 13 basis points. Sequentially, the
card net charge-off rate improved 45 basis points. The 30-plus delinquency rate improved 59 basis points from
last year and 26 basis points from the prior quarter, as credit performance of our card portfolio continued to be
stable, demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer base.
Our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance, with net charge-offs down 1
basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding purchased loans, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved 37
basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in our personal loan portfolio
continued to be very strong this quarter, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions
implemented over the past several years. Net charge-offs improved 130 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency
rate was down 39 basis points from the prior year.
While overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter, we expect the economic environment
to lead to deterioration in consumer credit, with delinquencies likely increasing in 2021. The timing of the rise in

delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted, if there is a second government stimulus program or
economic trends shift materially.
Slide 10 shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter, we added $42 million to the allowance, driven by a
$354 million increase in organic student loans. Other loan products were generally flat from the prior quarter.
With the backdrop of an uncertain, but improving macroeconomic environment, we modeled several different
scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter. Our key macro assumptions were an unemployment
rate of 11% at the end of 2020 and slowly recovering over the next several years. We also consider the current
trends in unemployment and the increasing number of COVID cases.
Moving to slide 11, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 50 basis points sequentially, primarily due to the
decline in loan balance. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic
environment at that time, and it remains suspended.
We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share. We are in the process of preparing our
second stress test submission and will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions, subject to the final
stress capital buffer, regulatory and rating agency expectations, and board approval.
In summary, solid results in the third quarter. The portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall
delinquency levels. Reserves were flat, except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance and
commitment levels increased. Net interest margin improved from the second quarter and is trending positively as
a result of our aggressive deposit pricing. And finally, strong execution on our targeted expense reductions.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Maria, to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning and good quarter. Appreciate all the color on reserves and provisions. Roger, clearly,
there's nothing that we see within the credit metrics that suggests weakness outside of the headlines on potential
white-collar layoffs. Are there any specific signs that you're seeing inside the portfolio that leads you to be
concerned? And how significant the change in the environment would there have to be for you guys to have to
build reserves again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So, I'll let John cover the part about reserves, Sanjay. But in terms of the environment, I think the jobless claims
numbers, and we'll see what this week has, but seven straight weeks, over 800,000. And more and more of that
permanent unemployment and white-collar is a reason for ongoing concern. But I think as you look at our
portfolio, I am very pleased with the performance across all products. And you can see that from the broadest
metric we disclosed, the 30-day delinquency rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And, Sanjay, in terms of reserving, we modeled a number of different assumptions and took a conservative
approach across the board. What we saw was, actually, as Roger said, excellent underlying portfolio
performance. There is that level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime consumers. But to
date, we don't see anything that's out there that would suggest that reserves are, I'll say, weak or deep
strengthening at this point.
We did model a second round of stimulus. We don't know if that's going to happen. There's some reason to be
optimistic, but no one can tell on these sorts of things these days. So, we'll see. But we'll look at it through the
quarter, the fourth quarter and make the call in terms of what's appropriate from a GAAP standpoint.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, and good morning. Look, we're entering what's historically the most important part of the year in
terms of spending and consumer behavior. I'm curious, two things. You're seeing an uptick in spending, which is a
good sign. I'm curious how you will approach this from a marketing and rewards perspective. We know you pulled

back a little bit to this point to manage expenses. But given the consumer seems to be rebounding, will you be a
little bit more aggressive on rewards or marketing as we head into the holiday season?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Rick. In terms of marketing, while we did cut expenses in line with the economic environment, we
have continued to market across all of our products and have been very excited actually about the quality of new
accounts we're bringing in on the card book, as well as some of the costs we're seeing as competitors pulled back
more aggressively.
Now, I do expect some of that to normalize over time. But again, we're going to continue marketing through the
fourth quarter. In terms of the rewards program, our program is well suited to this environment. Consumers prefer
cash over miles. I think a lot of the miles programs I see in the marketplace are struggling to add relevance in
redemption options. In particular, our strong partnerships with PayPal and Amazon, some of the programs we're
already putting in market with Amazon will serve us well in the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. So, Roger, I mean, these are the times where you can potentially step in and gain share and be
opportunistic. We saw American Express buy Kabbage. Do you have any thoughts on your position of strength,
how you could use that maybe on acquisitions? Or are you going to just sort of hold tight given the uncertainty?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I think we are leveraging that position of strength. I believe we're gaining share, both in terms of sales and
loans and card, and had a very strong peak season for student loans. Acquisitions are a little more challenging.
And so, as we think about how we use capital, the top priority is supporting organic growth. Next comes a mix of
dividends and buybacks. Acquisitions tend to be a distant third.
Our primary interest is in the payment space. But while valuations have come in a bit, especially where cross-
border type companies, they're still very high. And so, a lot of what we're seeing are opportunities for either
investments, partnerships. So, we'll look at it. But I think we're probably more likely to be aggressive on the
organic side, subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just one quick clarification; what percentage of the portfolio is promo right now, because it sounds like
that's going to help on the card yield going forward?

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. It's encouraging to see positive operating leverage in this
environment. That's consistent with what we've seen over the last decade plus from you guys. But there had been
some concern among investors when you guys gave guidance earlier this year pre-COVID that Discover may
have lost its expense discipline.
And that's the reason that you guys had, at the time, guided to negative operating leverage was due to years of
chronic underinvestment. Roger, understanding that there will always be one-off investments that need to be
made. But that aside, can you speak to your confidence level in being able to continue to generate consistent
positive operating leverage as we look to the other side of this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, first, having been here for over 20 years, I have to maybe disagree with the phrase
chronic underinvestment. I think our investments have been appropriate. But at the beginning of the year, we saw
an opportunity to invest more. And so, I would characterize it that way. Clearly, the year changed dramatically.
And hopefully, you've seen very strong expense discipline in terms of the target we put out there and how well
we're progressing against that target. It's a little challenging just to look at operating leverage because that
includes, what I'll call, sort of day-to-day corporate type expenses that we're always trying to bring down, but then

also marketing investments to drive profitable growth and high-returning accounts. And so, it's a blend of those
two.
But again, I think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that I think has always been a hallmark
here at Discover, our overall lower cost operating model, but we will invest according to the opportunities we see
in the marketplace. And I guess I'd point to the returns we're generating as an example of the effectiveness of that
business model even through extremely challenging cycles.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
John, on the net interest margin, you saw some really nice expansion. You talked about the benefits that you're
seeing from lower promo activity. Can you maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes from here? Asset
yields are obviously going to be improving. And it seems like the funding tailwinds are sizable over the next
couple of quarters. So, if we had peaked out in the low-2.40s, could we actually potentially see the margins
somewhere in excess of that over the next few quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation, as well as in terms of the
comments to provide, frankly, an additional insight in terms of what's happening to the funding mix, the maturity
profile and the cost of our debt stack. And what you can see there is based on the maturity profile and the cost
we're seeing versus online deposits that there will be an opportunity to expand net interest margin.
Now, that's subject to a lot of different things, right? Obviously, there's one piece, which is the health of the
portfolio, and that's been strong. Certainly, the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an impact and
typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit. But overall, as you look at where we are this quarter, I see some upside
from that from my vantage point today.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe if I can ask a follow-up question from a topic that was hit on before; so, John, I think in your
prepared remarks you commented that you're looking for additional efficiencies. Maybe can you just help us
understand – and maybe Roger can hop in on this, too. Of the 90% of the $400 million that you've saved, how
much of that is just investments that have been deferred versus actual core efficiencies that you guys have
identified and taken out? And what could this mean for the trajectory of the cost base outside of marketing as we
look into 2021? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, thanks. So, I would characterize it this way, is the $400 million of cost savings from the previous
guidance, I wouldn't necessarily call that a deferral. What I would say is we took a look at the economic
environment and took $400 million of our planned spending. Now, as I said in the remarks, which you clearly
picked up on, Ryan, was that the bulk of that has been on marketing and brand.
Now, as we look through the balance of this year and some of the actions that we took, we saw benefits across a
host of P&L lines, expense lines specifically. And we're going to use that, frankly, as a new benchmark in order to
really make some determinations on what we need to spend in 2021 to ensure that we continue to grow profitably.
I would say this, if the economic environment continues to improve, it's natural that we're going to spend more
money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future. But the other expense lines,
professional fees, information processing, other miscellaneous expense, we're going to keep a foot on those to
ensure that we're disciplined about how we're spending the dollars.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess, I sort of am struck by the fact
that the efficiency ratio in the quarter was actually better than it was in 2019. And you're kind of demonstrating
certainly likely to be the best growth in spend volume and one of the better growths, if not the best, in receivables
or smallest decline. And I guess I'm also struck by stuff we see in the industry that there's continued more cash-
back mail from some of your big competitors where that wasn't as big a focus.
And so, kind of maybe – some of this has been discussed already, but I'm sort of struck by that. It seems like you
have an opportunity. And where does – where can you direct that attention? And how much do you have in kind
of available, whether it's spending on rewards or marketing? Like, what are the tools and how are you going to
use them over the next few quarters, particularly now as we're going into the holiday season? Thanks.

Yeah. Thanks, Moshe. We're using all the tools we have available. I would point out there still is a good amount of
economic uncertainty. And so, we are not changing credit policy on the card side. I think we want to see more and
more signs of sustained recovery.
But the cash-back program is resonating well, as I said earlier. And there's always a lot of competition in cash
rewards from major issuers. So, I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever. But it is a time
where consumers are rethinking which cards they want. Do they really need another frequent flyer mile at this
point?
And then the other part is the only major issuer with no fees on any of our card products, but knowing a fee
message resonates surprisingly well. And then, finally, I'd point you, we're seeing great strength on the other side
of the balance sheet on the deposit side, where we compete the same way, right? Good value, but an outstanding
customer experience. So, we're really excited. Certainly, uncertainty as to what the holiday season will bring, as I
talk to retailers out there. But I feel good about our ability to continue to gain share.

Good morning. I'd just like to follow up on some of the NIM comments. I mean, you're seeing some – a little bit
more resiliency on the asset yields, in particular, some of the personal loans and card rates. Could you talk about
the competitive environment in both of those products and your expectations for those yields, at least in the next
couple of quarters, just given the resiliency that we've seen in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we look at the card yields, they'll overall be relatively stable, subject to kind of the mix of balance
transfers and promos. And as I said earlier, we're going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions. If we
can do that – do some promos or balance transfers safely in a credit environment, we'll do that, because it would
be high-returning customers. But the leverage that we're going to get in future quarters will come out of the
funding base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And Kevin, maybe one thing I'd add, too. As we set pricing, given how hard it is to reprice cards after the
CARD Act, we're not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter. We're working closely with finance, a very
disciplined through the cycle look. And so, it's really where our growth is occurring and that promo mix that will
drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors.

Yeah. That all makes sense. And then regarding the liability side, the order of magnitude in the drop and liability
costs over the last couple quarters are obviously very strong, just given the rate environment. I mean, how much
more room do you feel like you have to bring deposit costs lower, just given the current rate environment and the
outsized amount of liquidity on your balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we continue to look at that. And the decision would be subject to two factors. One, the amount of
liquidity we have on the balance sheet, and right now, we're in a situation where we have excess liquidity. And
then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape.
And then third, which is a consideration of the business is, certainly, the customer relationships and ensuring that
our long-term good quality customers aren't feeling like they're impacted in a way that's unfair. Now, with all that
said, I'm seeing a persistent low-rate environment. And with a persistent low rate environment, I do believe that
there is some amount of room to price downward. But again, it's caveated by all those points that I just mentioned.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you and good morning. Just wondered what you've built into your reserves as far as the trajectory of
charge-offs. And I would expect – I mean I guess, you're not – really given where delinquencies are, you're not
expecting to see charge-offs move up much in the fourth quarter and then more back-half weighted to 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, I would start off by stating that the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially could be
when we closed the book in March has been extraordinarily strong, and we're really, really pleased by that. In
terms of trajectory of both delinquencies and charge-offs, yeah, we are seeing certainly a push from 2020 into
2021.
And the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the factors that we built into our reserve calculation,
GDP, unemployment, new jobless claims, stimulus or lack thereof. So, we're going to monitor the portfolio, but
just to kind of net it for you and the other folks on the call, 2020 looks super solid, 2021 level of uncertainty, and
we expect the bubble to push through into certainly beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second
half of 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up, just the jobless claims 787,000 this morning, a big improvement, but
ridiculously high report of that sort.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
But I mean direct bank – your position, Roger, as a direct bank, I think, is the right strategy for the long term. Are
there new products or services that you're planning to build through that direct bank? I mean we have, obviously,
a lot of these neobanks that are delivering different products and maybe to a different demographic than Discover
focuses on. But where do you see opportunities to leverage off of your direct bank strategy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So, in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank, I think we're in great shape. And it's leveraging
the products we already have. I don't see the need for expanding our products. If you look at the breadth from
home equity to a broad range of deposit products, including checking or debit accounts, great strength, of course,
on the card side, personal loans. So, we have the products.
I think the opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth. So, I'm
very excited about where we're positioned. I'd say maybe one of the big differences versus the neobanks is
perhaps a different focus around profitability. So, we'll see how that plays out over the long term. But I couldn't be
more excited about where we're positioned.

Understood. Okay. And then just one quick one on the – I was hoping to get a little bit of an update more on the
network business. Specifically, I was looking at – it looks like your volumes are growing pretty nicely in both
PULSE and network partners, but yet as you attributed, the revenue declined in both those businesses. So, I was
just wondering, what is happening there? Is it just competitive factors? Is there a mix issue? Just hoping to get a
little more color there. Thank you.

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, it was actually a combination of two things. So, there was a bit of a mix shift to
some products with lower fees and rates. There was also some higher incentives that came through based on the
mix that we enjoyed in the quarter. I would say that in terms of overall volume, it was up 16% year-over-year, at
least for PULSE. And certainly, we are happy about that. We are continuing to look at the mix and incentives to
ensure we're driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments we're making there in the payments
business.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Couple questions. Just first off on the outlook for growth, I know typically it's a function of account growth and
balances per account and obviously you've had some shrinkage recently because of the spend levels that we all
know about. I'm just wondering if we could dig into the account growth aspect of that equation. Just to understand,
how account growth has been going? What COVID has meant to account growth? How you flexed? And do you
see any opportunity to accelerate account growth from here as we go into the back half of the year and into 2021?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, just one thing on the receivables growth, the higher payment rate is a big factor as well. So, good news
on what it's doing on the deposit side of our business. But that is having a significant impact on loan growth for
both card and personal loans.
In terms of new accounts, while we don't disclose a number on that, what I would say is that we think we've
probably sustained new account marketing more than a lot of competitors, as I look at industry metrics. And so,
we feel good about that and kept our marketing spend sort of appropriate for the environment and for our

somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we made earlier in the year. So, I would not expect dramatic
changes until we get more certainty in terms of the pace of recovery, but we've continued to market across all of
our products.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, you've been pleased with your account growth that you've generated over the past couple of quarters.
That's what I'm hearing from you, Roger, is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And in particular, I think we called out on the last call, some of the cost per account that we were seeing in
different channels as competitors pulled back more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Okay. And then just separately on credit and the outlook for credit here, one of the questions is around
stimulus and if you don't get it, how much does that impact potential changes in the reserve? And then the other
piece is on the mortgage forbearance, I think, I believe a majority of your customers have mortgages. And I'm
wondering if you know through credit data checks, how many of those people are benefiting today from the
mortgage forbearance? And does that feed into your reserve analysis as well? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Okay. Yeah. So, look, I'll talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end.
So, in terms of the stimulus that we modeled in, it is one of many inputs and we'll look at what happens in the
fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get, I'll say, a
bottoms-up view of actually the impact there.
So, no specific information on that other than to say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we
thought they would be at this time. And if another round of stimulus doesn't come in, I think that's going to be
tough for a number of people that have been impacted by the pandemic. And progressively, it will start to impact
the prime revolver base. And that's why we're conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third
quarter. But overall, again, we're pleased with our positioning.
Now, in terms of the mortgage forbearance, actually, we really don't have any data on that. What we are seeing is
our home equity business continues to – it's open for business. Our underwriting standards have tightened mildly
through this, and it's positioned pretty well and open for business.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to take a look at capital trends and buybacks. And I
know that you guys are in the midst of preparing your second stress test submission. But I was wondering in
terms of timing as to when you would get a better sense of the economy in order to possibly execute the
buybacks one more time. Is it in the back half of 2021 more into 2022? Just any thoughts on when you guys feel
you would have more clarity in terms of the economy in order to reinstate that buyback program. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Great. Thanks for the question. So, we're submitting our second round of stress test in November and included in
there are a number of judgments. I'm not going to get into any of the details, it'd be premature on that. I would
say, as you take a look at the capital trends for the business, they're super solid. Our capital levels are higher than
our targeted levels.
And Roger was specific in terms of our tiering of capital allocation priorities. So, there's no change to that, and
we're going to work through kind of the details with the Fed, other regulators, rating agency and then our board.
Sorry, I can't be more specific than that at this point.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit further on the funding tailwinds, could you give us a better
sense of kind of what mix you're targeting between the DTC and affinity deposits and the brokered? Is there a
minimum level of brokered that you want to maintain? And also, kind of what's the funding difference between
those two, just to give us a sense of how much your deposit funding on average could compress?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we want to keep the brokered CD channel open. So, we'll continue to kind of test that. The relative
change or difference between the direct-to-consumer and the brokered deposits narrowed significantly. In the
early stages of the pandemic, there was a substantial difference and the market took care of that and narrowed
the gap. We do enjoy a slightly better pricing if it's a direct relationship versus through a broker, so that will be our
focus. In terms of overall kind of mix of those, I would expect the broker channel to continue to contract a bit and
the direct channel expand.

Okay. With such a low funding on the ABS, why not maintain that or expand it? Are there like liquidity concerns of
having assets unencumbered that you're managing to? Or is there something else I'm not thinking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. No, the cost there on the ABS that's reflected is net of the hedge impact. So, fortunately, we hedged those
and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years. The actual, I'll say, contract rate on those
ABS transactions, quite a bit higher than that. So, that would – frankly, that was – the rates we're enjoying there is
just good work on the part of our treasury team to hedge that. So, we'll continue to ensure that the ABS channel is
there and present and available to us, but it will certainly come down as maturities profile indicates.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just wanted to see if we could kind of square the
circle around unemployment and where the unemployment rate is and the kind of liquidity that the consumer has
been given up until this day. And it sounds like we obviously both agree that delinquencies probably, given this
liquidity, don't even start rising until the first of the year.
And so, when you think about your expectation for unemployment at 11% by year-end and where we are and the
idea of a white-collar rush of unemployment, that would be quite the rush of white-collar unemployment versus the
amount of people that are unemployed now versus a steady state. And so, can you just talk about where the –
perhaps the job losses come from? And why such a large magnitude of white-collar versus still unemployed, call
it, blue-collar that we saw now and how that's influencing your outlook for the 11% unemployment rate? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Dominick. So, you touched on a lot there. And I would sum it up by saying there's a level of
uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment. Now the 11% does feel at this point like a, I'll call
it, a robust number, but what we're trying to get a good clarity on is as the service workers who initially were
impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks, some of those have returned.
We certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation and, frankly, the world that it
could be a tough winter here from a COVID standpoint. So, that's going to further impact not only service industry
but the entire economy. And so, as we sit here today, we're mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of
maintain the reserves where they are.
So, we don't expect there to be a rush of white-collar unemployment. But what will be clear, and we've seen some
of this already, is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the blue-collar staff for the business at
hand. And there's enough indications today that there could be some contraction. And as such, the
unemployment number's not exactly an easy number to predict, but we feel like as an input to our model, it's
appropriate at this point.

Dominick Gabriele Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Great. Thank you. And if I could just have one follow-up here, I really appreciate that. And if you look at the other
expenses on the expense base, it looks like the acceptance incentives came down as well as fraud, even though
we're kind of in this more online environment. Could you talk about what you're doing on the fraud side and how
that was – and did you renegotiate any of the global acceptance? Or is it a function of just volume and mix year-
over-year versus the third quarter of 2019 on how your expense base and other expense came down? Thanks so
much. I really appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, in terms of fraud, it doesn't reflect any renegotiations with any of our merchant partners. Fraud is one of
the areas where we're deploying advanced analytics and next-generation modeling and leveraging additional
information sources. So, I'm really excited about the progress the team is making there. And it's part of why we're
so committed to continuing to build out our analytics capability.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And then I would just add in terms of the other expense line. So, we did see lower global acceptance
expense in the quarter. And that's a function of two things. A little bit on the economy and liability associated with
some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements. And then,
frankly, just a level of uncertainty that's caused us to be cautious on the, I'll say, signing up new rich incentive
deals.
Now, we're still doing that where it makes sense. But in terms of timing, a little bit cautious on that one. But we've
seen actually great effectiveness from our procurement team, driving year-over-year savings on the entire indirect
cost base. And we're still, as we said in the remarks, investing in advanced analytics and some digital capabilities
that's driving up information processing. But my expectation is that we continue that we are, and we will continue
to get more efficient in overall information processing and technology spend.

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Bill. So, you folks don't have the TDR disclosures, but they'll come out in the Q
when it's published. And what you'll see there is relative to the first quarter, TDR volumes will be substantially
down. But there is also the impact of the CARES Act with a regulatory exclusion for certain modifications that
banks such as ours make.
So, if you put those two together and compare where we are in the third quarter versus where we were in the first
quarter and call the first quarter pre-pandemic, relatively stable. So, the point there is that there's not an
abundance of activities or a massive jump in any sorts of activities there that's impacting delinquencies.
We do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company and ensure that when there's a temporary issue
with a customer that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills. So, from a kind of credit
standpoint, TDR standpoint, there's been good execution from our customer service teams.
