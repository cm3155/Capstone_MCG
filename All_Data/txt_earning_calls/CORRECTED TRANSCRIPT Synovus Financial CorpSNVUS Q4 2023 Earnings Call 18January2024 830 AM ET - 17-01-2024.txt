Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Entering 2023, our primary corporate goal was summarized as focused execution. That
objective was rooted in delivering productivity gains within our core businesses, allowing us to deepen
relationships, grow our client base, and enhance financial performance. And secondarily, continuing to accelerate
the contributions generated through our new growth initiatives and adding talent in key businesses and markets to
expand our presence and profitability. We made steady progress in these areas, which led to solid growth and
built on our foundation to deliver healthy and consistent earnings and tangible book value growth over time.
In the midst of executing on our plan, we were presented with unforeseen challenges and our Synovus team
acted quickly and decisively in order to mitigate risk and better position the bank for a more challenging liquidity
and economic environment. Despite a more challenging environment, we produced healthy and consistent loan
growth in key commercial business lines, including middle market, corporate and investment banking, and
specialty lending.
Corporate and investment banking, which was officially launched in mid-2022, continues to prudently grow and
execute with over $650 million in loans outstanding and became PPNR positive in the middle of last year. Also,
our team was laser-focused on accelerating our core funding generation through sales activities, product
expansion, and specialty businesses. As a result, we delivered an 83% increase in total deposit production in
2023.

We delivered strong double-digit growth and adjusted fee income in 2023 as our treasury and payment solutions,
capital markets and wealth management teams continue to expand their contributions, supported by new
solutions, analytics, and an intense focus on building full relationships. Also, we further augmented and diversified
our non-interest revenue stream with an expanded balance sheet light relationship with GreenSky.
We maintain top quartile efficiency through proactive expense rationalization and disciplined cost management,
while continuing to make the investments in areas that will drive long-term shareholder value. On the asset quality
front, we continue to experience very manageable levels of credit losses and see no systemic deterioration across
our asset classes and footprint.
Finally, the balance sheet was strengthened in 2023 from solid core deposit growth and a reduction of office
commercial real estate loans and higher cost wholesale funding. We also increased our common equity Tier 1
ratio to over 10% through solid earnings accretion and prudent balance sheet optimization. Moreover, the
business mix was streamlined with the sale of our asset management firm, GLOBALT, which enables us to
reallocate investment into higher returning business lines.
Now, let's move to slides 3 and 4 for an overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial highlights.
Synovus reported 2023 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.41 and adjusted earnings per share of
$0.80. For 2023, we reported $3.46 in diluted earnings per share and $4.12 in adjusted EPS. However, the $51
million FDIC special assessment reduced fourth quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share by $0.26.
Therefore, excluding the FDIC assessment, fourth quarter reported EPS would have been $0.67 and adjusted
EPS would have been $1.06.
Higher funding costs and loan losses were headwinds for the banking industry in 2023. But in this challenging
environment, Synovus was able to grow core deposits, core non-interest revenue and maintain disciplined
expense control. Even with the challenges and excluding the FDIC special assessment, adjusted pre-provision
net revenue increased about 2% last year.
Net interest income grew $20 million for the year or roughly 1%, despite an 11 basis point margin contraction.
Excluding strategic loan sales of $1.6 billion in 2023, period end loans increased about 3% led by C&I business
lines, including middle market, CIB and specialty lending. Despite muted activity, CRE also experienced year-
over-year growth driven by increased utilization on previously committed construction facilities. There continues to
be an increased emphasis on stronger returns and more deposit relationship-based lending and we are pleased
with the increased margin and relationship profitability profile of the 2023 originations.
On the funding side, total core deposits increased 3% and total borrowings declined 57% in 2023. Our fourth
quarter net interest margin of 3.11% was stable quarter-over-quarter and better than our prior guidance as a
result of modestly lower than expected core interest-bearing deposit costs. Also, we were able to reduce higher
cost funding in broker deposits and FHOB borrowings due to the continued success of our deposit production
activities.
We remain confident that our net interest margin has reached a positive inflection point and should be relatively
stable in the first quarter. A more stable monetary policy environment coupled with fixed rate asset repricing
should support the NIM as we progress throughout 2024 and provide a multi-year tailwind for net interest income.
Despite continued headwinds from a soft mortgage environment and intentional reductions in checking program
fees, adjusted non-interest revenue increased 11% in 2023, supported by increases in treasury and payment
solution fees, capital market fees and wealth management fees as well as higher GreenSky income.

Non-interest expense remains well contained. Our proactive cost rationalization and management initiatives have
placed Synovus in a strong position as we start 2024. In this uncertain environment, asset quality remains
healthy. Excluding our loan sales, net charge-offs were a manageable 38 basis points in the fourth quarter and 28
basis points for the full year. Non-performing assets increased at a slower pace over the last three months and we
further built the allowance for credit losses.
Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position as we navigate through a more uncertain
economic environment. And with our CET1 position ending the quarter at 10.22%, up from the 9.63% a year ago,
we remain confident in our capital profile and well within our targeted capital levels of 10% to 10.5%.
We continue to make consistent progress in diversifying and optimizing our business mix, with growth in several
key areas, including middle market, commercial banking, CIB, treasury and payment solutions, capital markets,
banking as a service, and wealth management. These are the core businesses where we have shown the right to
win, and through execution and expansion, we'll deliver solid revenue growth well into the future.
Our talent is what truly differentiates Synovus. Our key objectives for the team in 2024 are, one, prudently
growing the bank; two, winning full relationships; and three, enhancing profits. We are committed to delivering on
these objectives while preserving and even improving key elements of our safety and soundness profile. I have
great confidence in our ability to not only meet our goals, but also to outpace our competition.
Now I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the quarterly results in greater detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. As you can see on slide 5, total loan balances ended the fourth quarter down $275 million
sequentially or about 1%. While loans declined modestly, overall trends were positive as key strategic business
lines saw growth and transaction-related declines signaled a return to more normal commercial real estate market
activity.
There were three primary drivers of the modest sequential decline in loans. First, loan production has been softer
over the past few quarters. Also, CRE and senior housing market transaction activity increased significant over
the last three months due to property sales and refinancing, which we believe shows more strength in those
markets.
Finally, strategic declines in non-relationship syndicated lending and third-party consumer loans continued in the
fourth quarter. Further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth. While C&I loans declined $182 million
sequentially during the fourth quarter, there was strategic growth in middle market loans, CIB and specialty lines.
These commercial loan categories also saw growth for the full year.
With regards to commercial real estate, excluding the $1.2 billion medical office building sale last quarter, we
generated approximately 7% loan growth last year, primarily from fund-ups of existing commitments. We continue
to prioritize clients both new and existing with broad-based deposit and fee income relationships. At the same
time, we are rationalizing growth and credit-only lending areas such as shared national credits and third-party
consumer lending that have a lower return profile or don't meet our strategic relationship objectives. As a result of
higher loan paydown activity and muted production, we expect to see a reduction in senior housing and
institutional commercial real estate this year. Our organic balance sheet optimization efforts will continue in 2024
as we focus on balanced loan and core deposit growth.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Turning to slide 6, core deposit balances grew $714 million or 2% sequentially during the fourth quarter, driven by
a 9% increase in time deposits and a 4% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits, which was partially offset
by a 5% decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. Seasonality contributed to public funds growth of $464 million or
7% on a sequential basis. And the pace of non-interest-bearing declines remains below the level experienced
during the peak in early 2023. Our strong fourth quarter core deposit growth allowed us to reduce broker deposits
by $179 million and overall borrowings by about $670 million, resulting in continued improvement in our wholesale
funding ratio to 13.5% from 15.1% in the third quarter.
As we look at funding costs, our average cost of deposits increased 19 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.5%.
As a result, our cycle today, total deposit beta was 45%, which was just below the range we communicated at an
industry conference last month. From October to December, total deposit costs were up 6 basis points. We
continue to expect the deposit costs will peak sometime during the first quarter.
Now moving to slide 7. Net interest income was $437 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 1% from the third
quarter, which is slightly better than our previously disclosed expectations. Our net interest margin was stable
during the fourth quarter versus 9-basis-point sequential decline in the third quarter. Better-than-expected core
interest-bearing deposit costs, reduced borrowings and the increasing earning asset yields supported the margin.
The partial securities repositioning, which was completed in December, had an estimated 1- to 2-basis-point
impact in the fourth quarter with an incremental 3 to 4 basis points benefit expected in the first quarter.
As we look forward, assuming a stable rate environment, we continue to expect the first quarter net interest
margin to be relatively stable, followed by expansion in the second half of the year. Longer term, the benefits of
fixed asset repricing remain a significant tailwind to the margin. Our sensitivity profile remains relatively neutral to
the front end of the curve, and we remain slightly asset-sensitive to longer-term rates. However, during an easing
cycle, the margin will exhibit short-term pressure due to the timing lag between loan and deposit repricing.
Slide 8 shows total reported non-interest revenue of $51 million. Adjusted non-interest revenue was $126 million,
up $20 million or 19% from the previous quarter. The sequential variance in fee income was due to a onetime
GreenSky fee of $12 million related to its legacy loan portfolio, as well as stronger treasury and payment solutions
and non-GLOBALT-related wealth fees.
With the expansion of our relationship with GreenSky, we anticipate onetime-related fees of about $5 million in
the first quarter and approximately $5 million in ongoing quarterly non-interest revenue thereafter, which is
currently reflected in our fundamental guidance. There were $78 million in security losses during the fourth
quarter, which we had previously announced in December.
Also, the GLOBALT sale at the end of the third quarter reduced non-interest revenue by approximately $2.4
million. We continued to invest in core non-interest revenue streams that deepen our client relationships and have
all demonstrated healthy growth this year. Treasury and payment solutions fees were up 11%, while wealth
management fees increased 11% and capital markets fees grew 21%.
In fact, syndicated finance and debt capital markets fees jumped over 100% in 2023. Non-interest revenue has
also been impacted by a soft mortgage lending market, as well as recent changes to our checking program.
However, the bank's relative stability of core client fee income over time highlights the diversity of our revenue
streams, many of which are insulated from the impacts of the volatile rate environment.

Moving to expense. Slide 10 highlights our ongoing operating cost discipline. Reported and adjusted non-interest
expense was $353 million in the fourth quarter. The $51 million FDIC special assessment inflated fourth quarter
reported and adjusted non-interest expense. Without that expense, adjusted non-interest expense would have
declined 1% from the third quarter. In September, we took prudent expense rationalization actions that will still
allow Synovus to appropriately invest for infrastructure needs and future growth. Adjusted employment expense
was down 4% sequentially and year-over-year, benefited by head count reductions during the fourth quarter, as
well as lower performance incentives. Finally, the recent GLOBALT sale reduced expense by about $2 million in
the fourth quarter.
As you can see on slide 11, total head count is down 9% from 2019. Over that same period, revenue has
increased 14%, resulting in an increase in revenue per FTE of 25% and a top quartile efficiency ratio. Our sharp
focus on operating expense discipline and prudent discretionary spend will continue throughout 2024 as we
manage through headwinds that pressure industry earnings.
Moving to slides 12 and 13 on credit quality. Credit metrics were relatively stable from the previous quarter,
adjusted for the third quarter loan sales, with a net charge-off ratio of 0.38%, an NPL ratio of 0.66%, and a total
criticized and classified loan ratio of 3.45%. The allowance for credit losses increased by $4 million to $537 million
or 1.24% of total loans, up 2 basis points from the third quarter. We continue to expect NCOs to average loans to
be 30 to 40 basis points in the first half of 2024, and we have a high degree of confidence in the strength and
quality of our loan portfolio. Moreover, we will continue to apply conservative underwriting practices and advanced
market analytics to new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management.
As seen on slide 14, our capital position improved during the fourth quarter with the common equity Tier 1 ratio
reaching 10.22% and total risk-based capital now at 13.07%. Capital accretion was impacted by the FDIC special
assessment and the securities losses during the fourth quarter, but as was the case throughout 2023, our core
earnings profile continues to support our capital position.
Looking ahead, our 2024 capital plan includes a stable common dividend and prioritizing prudent capital
management within our targeted range of 10% to 10.5%. Similar to 2022 and 2023, we have authorization for up
to $300 million in share repurchases in 2024.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our 2024 guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll now continue with our updated financial guidance for 2024, which is unchanged from the
expectations we outlined in early December. Loan growth is expected to be between 0% and 3% in 2024. Growth
should be driven by continued success in middle market, corporate and investment banking and specialty lending
business lines. This growth should be partially offset by market-related loan paydowns, which are expected to
return to more normalized levels and rationalization of credit-only loan relationships.
We maintain our expectations for core deposit growth of 2% to 6%. Despite a challenging and uncertain
industrywide growth environment, we have confidence that our focus on core deposit production and expansion of
relationships will continue to bear fruit in 2024.
The adjusted revenue growth outlook continues to be in a range of negative 3% to 1%, which assumes a flat
interest rate environment. The recent volatility in interest rates has shown the uncertainty in the outlooks for rates.

The reduction in loan rates to the 4% area, if maintained, would impact our revenue outlook for 2024 negatively
by approximately 1%. However, considering this impact, our outlook remains within the current revenue guidance.
It is uncertain how 2024 will play out with regards to Fed interest rate policy. But we expect two things to be true.
First, it's a short-term negative for net interest income and margin during the easing cycle as deposits reprice
slower than loans. And second over the longer term, we are relatively neutral to the short-term interest rates, so
the margin is expected to revert back to the starting point and likely higher once the easing cycle is completed.
Adjusted non-interest expense, which includes the fourth quarter FDIC special assessment, is expected to decline
between 1% and 5% in 2024 from a combination of several initiatives, including personnel and business
optimization, back office and corporate real estate rationalization, and less discretionary and third-party spend.
We will continue to be very disciplined in expense management while investing in areas that deliver long-term
shareholder value.
The result of expanding NIM and controlled expenses has forecasted acceleration of core PPNR growth
throughout the year. Assuming a stable economic environment, we expect to end 2024 with strong growth in
financial performance and an eye towards our longer term operating metric targets.
Moving to capital, we are within our CET1 range of 10% to 10.5% and we'll opportunistically manage our capital
levels within this target range dependent on forecasted economic conditions. We anticipate that tax rates should
approximate 21% to 22%, primarily supported by additional tax credit investments and further diversification of our
revenue sources.
Synovus' strategic actions in 2023, as well as the strength of the business model and the relative growth of our
footprint, have positioned the company for strong long-term revenue, earnings and tangible book value growth.
And now, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And in the

Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.

Morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just wanted to go – Kevin, you touched on it and Jamie as well. But on the revenue growth guide and your
interest rate assumptions, when I look at that guidance range, what takes you to the lower end of that range and
the higher end of that range? Is this mostly interest rate driven? And what is kind of built into that guidance in
terms of the short-term rate variance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jon, this is Jamie. Thanks for the question. As we think about volatility in revenue in 2024, the risks and
opportunities are actually fairly similar to each other. It comes from things like deposit mix, economic activity and
the Fed interest rate policy. So you know that our guidance is basically a flat rate scenario. So we have no Fed
easing in the guidance. We have the long-end stand stable at 4%. But within that, using those assumptions, we
would say that the biggest risks and opportunities come from deposit mix, economic growth, loan growth,
business growth. We would say those can present both risks and opportunities to 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And at this point, if you think about the forward curve in terms of your net interest income outlook, how
much of a headwind is that, Jamie? How difficult is that environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We debated a good bit how to best give insight into our performance in 2024 given the volatility of interest
rates. We decided to keep the front-end stable, but then speak to the impact based on the easing cycle just so
people could use whatever rate scenario they deem most appropriate because the assumptions change weekly. If

you compare where we were even a couple of weeks ago, the assumptions for Fed easing are very different than
where they are today.
But for us, as Kevin mentioned in his guidance comments just a minute ago. Longer term, we are neutral to the
front-end of the curve. And what we mean by that is, that when we come out of the easing cycle and deposits
normalized to the lower levels, we expect our margin to be relatively similar to where it was when we entered the
cycle. But during the cycle the lag on deposit costs relative to loan yield declines will reduce the margin. And
that's dependent on a few things. The impact of 2024 is dependent on the timing of easing. When does the Fed
begin the easing cycle. The speed of the easing, and how far does it go. But when we think about the impact to
our margin, we think that, that impact during the easing cycle could be anywhere between 2% and 4% reduction
in the margin. And then, again, we would revert back to the starting point once those deposit costs stabilize at the
end of the easing cycle.
So the timing is very important, the speed is important, the depth is important. But those – that's generally how we
see that impact. With regards to a full year 2024 revenue guide, it could be anywhere up to 2.5% of full year
revenue, given the scenarios we've seen from economists, markets, Fed dot plot, etcetera.
But there are other things that are not included in that guide. One is, in an easing cycle, it's likely that that will be a
positive impact to deposit mix shifts, and that's not included in my comments here and our expectations. It also
doesn't take into account the associated positives to economic growth, fee revenue, as well as credit.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Michael. When we look at the slide, I think it speaks to the diversity of our revenue and how we've
continued to try to add new sources of growth that allows us to take on some of the headwinds. And so, whether
it's the sale of a business or just reducing our NSF/OD income or seeing a movement on products like repo where
we've been very successful this last year.
If you look at the left-hand side of that chart, banking as a service is GreenSky, which we're continuing to work
through the contractual – finalizing the contract there, and we still expect that to represent a sizable increase in
income in 2024.
But also, within banking as a service, we're expanding our offerings within our merchant acquiring company
where we own a majority interest, Qualpay. We've expanded our sponsorship of third-party ISOs. And so, all of
those banking-as-a-service programs will contribute growth year-over-year.
Treasury and payment solutions, if you look at the last three years, we've grown it 20%. We expect that to
continue to increase in 2024 with some repricing opportunities, as well as continued expansion of our sales
practices. Wealth was up 11% this past year. With AUM growing 8%, we expect that to continue to grow based on
the talent and the success of our business model.
Capital markets, as we've expanded CIB and our wholesale bank, we've continued to grow. That's up 20% in
2023 and that will continue to grow in 2024. And then, we've seen some traction on some of the government
guarantee gains, whether that's USDA or SBA loans. And so, when you look at all of those that will help to offset
those headwinds and we think we'll get a little bit of growth in NIR this coming year as a result of that.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great color. And maybe just as my follow-up. I appreciate all the color related to Jon's questions, but just
wanted to dig into some of the mix shift, the comments that you mentioned, Jamie. And then, how quickly do you
guys think you would be able to kind of pull down some of the interest-bearing deposit costs, assuming we do get
a couple rate cuts this year. I think that's a pretty big outstanding question for you and a lot of banks. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's one of the bigger questions for the industry for 2024, for sure. When you – well, first in our assumptions,
we assume that NIB declines further in 2024 to somewhere between 23% and 24% of total deposits. But to your
question on interest-bearing costs, we really break it up into four buckets, and so – or three buckets excluding
NIB. We have what we call the kind of high beta systematic repricing, which would include broker deposits in our
core CD portfolio. Those reductions, the broker deposits are near [ph] 100% (00:30:11) beta and time deposits
reprice pretty systematically given maturities schedules. So that's pretty simple.
But then you have the interest-bearing non-maturity deposits. And what we have is, for us, about 30% of total
deposits are standard rates, and those reprice through decisions we make centrally. And the rates on those
deposits are lower within our interest-bearing deposits. And so, the beta will be a little lower, but the repricing is
simpler than the exception price deposits, exception around 20% in total. Those are higher costs. And so we do
expect the beta to be lower, but they involve a conversation. And so, we're already focused on strategies of how
11

do we address that subcomponent of the deposit portfolio. But we're ready to go and we're prepared for these in

Sorry to ask your third NIM question in a row, but I think clarity would be important here. And I know, Jamie, those
scenarios that are changing every day. But if you just look at the current forward curve, say, six cuts, you guys are
guiding under flat rates to get to a 3.20% NIM in 4Q 2024. How does that change if the forward curve plays out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think you need to look to the prior comment around 2% to 4% compression of the margin during the cycle,
depending on how fast it's going. But if you assume a steady 25 cuts per meeting, I would just assume that the
margin contracts somewhere between 2% and 4% in the fourth quarter.

2% to 4% down. Got it. And your commentary is interesting about eventually returning to where the NIM used to
be. And your NIM used to be 3.60% to 3.80%. Do you think with that normally slope yield curve, I know it's been
20 years since we've had one in normal rates, you could get back into that range?

So when we look further out – when we – we didn't include it in this deck, but we've included it in our two prior
investor decks the fixed rate asset repricing. The benefit due to fixed rate asset repricing in 2024 is approximately
12

20 basis points. And you could run that forward for 2025, 2026. It doesn't go forever, but it does go for the next
few years.
And so, we think that, that is a really strong tailwind. Now, there are headwinds that are not included in that, and
one would be deposit mix and other would be business mix as far as loan spreads and where you're originating
loans. But that tailwind is there. And so we do believe that when we get through whatever this easing cycle is,
however it plays out. So we continue to have a strong tailwind to the margin for multiple years and we expect to
see that play out and that would get us in the context of what you're describing with higher, what's kind of
historically more normalized margins.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. If I could ask one other question. So you guys had 3% core revenue growth in 2023, really
strong fee income growth. And if I look at the guide, you're down 3% to plus 1%. When I think about the company
or markets, your position, I think back to the Investor Day, all the initiatives, when I look at this, really for you
Kevin, are you pleased with that level of growth? And is it that – I perceive you to be more of a strong organic
growth company, but you're more about improving efficiency, if you will. Just curious, your take on the revenue
capabilities of the company here this year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think the percent growth in revenue is much more of a function of the decline in the NIM from first quarter
to fourth quarter. And so when you look at a full year-over-year increase in revenue, it shows that negative
number. But when you look at it more on an inflection point, you go back to fourth quarter earnings from 2023
versus fourth quarter of 2024. What you'll see is that there is an 8% to 10% growth in PPNR and I think that's
what does get me excited and it really does show the strength of our model, Steve, and our footprint and our
ability to grow.
But what you're seeing when you look at year-over-year is much more of the financial metrics declining and
margin during 2023, which makes that year-over-year comparison look muted. But when you look at it on a more
apples-to-apples basis, fourth quarter versus fourth quarter, you're looking at 10% growth in bottom line, which I
think again is much more constructive and supporting of our growth story.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
My first question is on GreenSky. I understand the somewhat one-time in nature income that happened in the 4Q
and that will happen in 1Q, but as you look longer term, what is the earnings impact that GreenSky could add to
Synovus? And I think all that is realized in fee income, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It is, Brady. And look, I said this on a previous call. The number could be between $20 million and $30 million in
revenue for the go-forward program and it's really a function more so of what the underlying production is of the
new entity. And so we'll continue to generate revenue based on that production and we'll get a maintenance
administration fee on anything that still sits on the book. So our revenue will be much more tied to the production
volumes that they're doing, but again, I think a good rule of thumb for this coming year is $20 million to $30
million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, Kevin, as you look bigger picture, there's been so much change at
Synovus over recent years. I know just in 2023, you exited medical office and auto, you did the bond
restructuring. Are you happy with where the business sits right now or are there other big strategic moves that we
should be expecting going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Look, I'm happy with where our business mix sits today. I think there are opportunities to continue to overinvest in
certain businesses, whether that's our middle market platform, our private wealth platform, our banking as a
service. And so, you'll see us continue to make strategic investments in those areas. But as it relates to things
like, loan sales or exiting businesses, I think those – you will not see a lot of that going forward. And when you
look at our loan slide we provided this quarter and you look at where we grew, some of those strategic growth
engines like middle market, specialty, community bank are growing, where you see strategic declines in things
like our third-party consumer, which will continue to decline for the foreseeable future as well as national
accounts. Those won't be sales, but there'll be slow drawdowns of those balances because they're not obviously,
relationship-focused.
But the wild card on growth really comes in those market activity declines that we saw this past quarter where you
see institutional CRE where payoffs are increasing because they've been at historically low levels. Our senior
housing, same thing, we're seeing a more constructive marketplace for sales and refinance activity with some of
the agencies. And so, as I look at the business and just put loans on that as an example, I feel really good about
where we are. We'll be growing some faster than others, we'll be strategically shrinking some portfolios. But you
won't see the dramatic balance sheet or business mix optimization like we've seen in 2023.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So previously, CD repricing was thought to be a headwind to NII and the margin. I guess, that's still the case for
short-term. But could you give us an update on your CD strategy going forward as we potentially enter an easing
cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, yeah, Brandon, on CD strategy, we still have a lot of renewing CDs that will come forward in the
coming quarters. And so we're going to continue to be very aggressive at pricing those CDs at market rates to
keep them on the books. Obviously, the marginal rate of a new CD when you look at this past quarter was 4.40%
when you combine production and renewals, which was actually down about 20 basis points versus the previous
quarter. And so it shows you that there's been a little bit of a rationalization in the marketplace from a competitive
perspective, but our portfolio is at about 4.16% today.
So as we continue to produce new CDs, which again appears to be the decision of the consumer, people are still
moving money from money market accounts into time deposit. And so we want to make sure that we pay
attention to the consumer preference. So we'll continue to produce that. But at some point, that portfolio will
largely equal where the production is, so to be less of a headwind as it relates to deposit pricing. And as Jamie
has mentioned in the past, the real benefit that we'll have to reach maximum deposit pricing will be deposit mix.
So as we continue to bring down broker and we can replace that with core deposits, the negative impact that
headwind you faced with CD production will be offset by a positive shift in mix. And so that's why we think in the
first quarter, we'll largely see the peak for deposit pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brandon, just to add a little more to that answer. The first quarter, the core CDs that are maturing, the
average rate is just over 4%. That's about 4.05% and so the marginal impact of that to the margin is much less
than it was in the fourth quarter, as Kevin mentioned. And then as we look forward in 2024, our core deposit
growth will be led by money market in 2024, which will be a little bit of a change from 2023. And so we believe
that, that will also be a positive when you think about total deposit costs going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Very helpful. Very helpful. And then, Jamie, just give us an update on how you think about managing the balance
sheet this year in regards to your liquidity position and maybe the potential to pay down more debt.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look at the balance sheet, our liquidity position is very strong. The efforts we made in 2023 have positioned
us really well for 2024, so we can go out there and do what we do best, which is serve our clients. And so that's
how we feel heading into this year. What you should expect to see from us is a continued paydown or attrition of
our broker deposit portfolio, potentially $250 million to $500 million here in the first quarter. We are very low on
home loan bank advances at the moment, a little less than $1 billion at year-end.
So as we look forward, we think that we are positioned to optimize liabilities out of balance sheet. We don't have
any imminent needs for unsecured debt. And we think that we'll continue to try to be balanced on core deposit
growth, which will be more back-end loaded this year and core loan growth which could be more balanced growth
throughout the year. So we may have a little bit of a funding gap between loans and deposits early in the year, but
that's not unexpected.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe asking Brandon's question a little differently. So wholesale funding went from 15% to 13.5%. You continue
to work that down. I guess, ultimately, as you continue working on the liability side of the balance sheet, where is
the target there? Where could that wholesale funding ratio continue to migrate towards?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We're very comfortable with where it is right now. We're comfortable with our liquidity all together. And so it's
really just a balancing. That's not a ratio that we manage to. And so we look at all of our hierarchal sources of
funding, including the marginal public funds, and we think about how do we optimize our liability mix to fund the
balance sheet.

Synovus Financial Corp.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
But we have a lot of sources of liquidity. We have a lot of sources of liquidity that are higher cost. And right now,
given our liquidity position, we have the luxury of being able to run those down. But as we look forward into 2024
and beyond, it's our intent to go out and take advantage of the opportunity in the Southeast. And as Kevin
mentioned, in response to Steven's question, go out and grow and deliver Synovus to more and more clients.
And so we believe that we are well-positioned for that. And whether or not we fund that with, priority one being
core deposit growth. But beyond that, we have a lot of availability, either in wholesale funding, which would
include broker deposits or home loan bank advances or even go out and grow some of those easier marginal
sources of liquidity like public funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then switching to the loan side, so you had the medical office sale earlier in the year, you're
working down balances in senior housing, I guess, one, what's your remaining exposure or what is your exposure
to kind of the healthcare medical field?
And then, two, as you look at it from a credit standpoint, where are you guys at as far as credit quality and things
to look for primarily within that senior housing portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, look, from a healthcare perspective, you have to look at it really across two different areas. On C&I, it's
about 7% of our balances and a lot of that is on the senior housing side. We talked about managing down our
exposure there. It was really more around the fact that we've seen more payoff activities. And so, we feel really
good about where we are in senior housing. When you look at some of the losses that we incurred this quarter,
there were a handful of losses, and Bob can touch on that. But we feel very good about the overall exposure.
And so, we are not trying to manage down our exposure in healthcare. Some of it has been just the fact that
we've started to see a more constructive market in terms of payoff activity. And put that in broader perspective.
When we talk about that, we had about $1.2 billion in payoffs this past quarter. We've been running about $700
million to $800 million a quarter in our loan book. So, about $500 million more in payoffs. If you look at a three-
year average, we generally run about $1.3 billion in payoff activity. So we're back to a more normalized level. So
you could continue to see things like senior housing and some other CRE portfolios decline just given the fact that
production has slowed and payoff activities picked up. Bob, if you want to touch on some of the credit metrics
around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Sure, yeah. Specifically to the senior housing metrics, 90% of our portfolio in that space is still pass-rated credit.
So we have a fairly low ratio of rated loans there. Our charge-offs have been small and manageable, and non-
accrual loans are also small. And specifically, the shrinkage there to Kevin's point of really the market – the
payoffs beginning to pick up. And the net effect of that would just be a reduction in that specific portfolio.
Overall, though, we're pretty comfortable with healthcare. As an industry, we have our specialty vertical in our
corporate and investment banking business that specializes in healthcare. It's just that the senior housing portfolio
itself, so a lot of real estate characteristics is probably seeing some reduction relative to the increase in payoffs,
but the credit quality certainly still remains manageable.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive into the deposit growth and the success you're having there. Kevin or
Jamie, can you give us additional background in terms of where that growth is focused. Are you looking at the sort
of standard customer, using Jamie's explanation a few callers ago, or even would you take on new exception
customer if it sort of fit your objectives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You go ahead, Jamie. You go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we think about deposit growth, it's a very important component to our outlook for 2024, but before speaking to
this year, I'd like to speak to 2023 because we had 3% core deposit growth in 2023 with significant headwinds in
the first half of the year, including the $2 billion decline in non-bearing deposits, and I think that that shows the
strength of our production.
I mean, production was up 83% year-over-year and that strong production is basically result of renewed focus,
driving deposit growth, incentive realignment, and we think that that'll continue and we think that, that's what is the
underpinnings of our core deposit growth forecast for 2024. And so, we have – our incentives are pushing it.
We're having the intentional build-out of our businesses aligned around bringing in the full client, which will include
increased deposit growth.
We have a new leader in private wealth focused on full relationships. CIB is growing and they've hired a liquidity
specialist whose partnering with new and existing clients to help bring liquidity solutions to our commercial clients.
And our commercial lines of business continue to target clients with full balanced relationships. And one data
point on that is, in our middle market business, we had 8% core deposit growth in 2023. And so, we believe that
fundamentally, we're well positioned to grow deposits this year. And we think that, that should see continued
success.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Do you think that lower rates could actually trigger more C&I-related movements in your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, number one, it could trigger line utilization increasing just as rates come down. We did see a modest
increase in just same line balances this past quarter. But as you know, Chris, for the last several quarters, we've
18


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
seen folks using their cash to pay down lines. So I think lower rates will drive up some line utilization, one. Short
term, if rates were going lower, it tells us that the economy is slowing. So there may be a latent impact of that. But
longer term or more moderate term, yes, I think it could drive up C&I as people are looking at projects again and
starting to expand their facilities or add inventory as prices come down. And the economic – the underlying
economic conditions remain constructive. Yes, it would result in having stronger loan growth in that kind of the
out-quarters.

Operator: We will now take a question from Russell Gunther from Stephens. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. I just have a couple of points of clarification on the margin commentary. So, first, the
4Q 2024 outlook of around 3.20%, that's down from the 3.25% expectation earlier in the month, despite the better
results in 4Q 2023. So could you just walk us through what's changed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That is simply the reduction in the long end of the curve. So that's the move from 4.5%, 10-year to a 4% 10-year.
That drove the decline from 3.25% to 3.20%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Excellent. And then just to follow up again then on the 2% to 4% decline using the forward curve. So, are
you guys talking relative to the margin on a percentage basis or is that NII dollars? And then are you guys thinking
of the starting point as 4Q 2023 results or relative to your 4Q 2024 expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
[ph] And I'll point (00:52:10) on the 2% to 4% – and that's a 2% to 4% reduction in the margin. So 6 to 12 basis
points is, if you assume – if you want to assume that the Fed begins easing in May, you could assume that the
Q3, whatever you had in there for your Q3 margin, would be 2% to 4% lower. And so that's kind of how we're
thinking about it, just because the assumptions continue to change around when does this easing cycle start and
how aggressive is it. We just wanted to give you something so that you could plug in whatever your expectation
is, and then just know that once we're in that cycle, that is what we expect the impact to the margin to be.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Jamie, could – I just wanted again just to clarify, that was a 6 to 12 basis points. So that per cut that you're kind of
saying on a static balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
No, no, that's not per cut. That's just during the cycle. That's our expectation of where the margin will be as we
progress through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. So, it would be, if the forward curve comes to pass, it's the 6 to 12 basis points off of the 3.20% that
you're kind of outlining as the ending point for the NIM by the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. And within that range, you could say that the more aggressive the Fed is, so if they're going faster, then it's
going to be at the higher end of the range, the larger negative impact. And if it's a slow, methodical, it could be the
lower end of the range.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
We are assuming I mentioned the $250 million to $500 million this quarter, and then, you would assume, probably
not the high-end of that range each quarter going forward, but maybe $200 million to $400 million Q2 to Q4
decline in broker deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Cool. And then I just want to ask one last one on the other income. I know that GreenSky, the $12 million
was in there, but setting the GreenSky aside, it looks like it was still a decent quarter for the other income line
item. And so I just wanted to ask what drove that, and is it sustainable? And for the guidance for low-single digit
growth in fee income, could you just remind us what base that is growing off of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
In other income, there's a little bit of that that is not necessarily repeatable. We had about a $3 million increase in
BOLI revenue in the fourth quarter versus prior quarters, and so that's something. As we think about fee revenue
in the first quarter, there are two headwinds. You have that $3 million, then you have the impact of the GreenSky
fourth quarter transaction that will not reoccur in the first quarter. What was the second part of your question,
Brody?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just the low-single digit growth in fee income that I think you called out on the slide. Just remind me what the
base that you're growing that off of is?

continued interest in Synovus. I also want to once again thank all of our team members for your contributions in
2023, for meaningful progress on important priorities and strategic investments to the solutions delivered and the
exceptional client experiences, you make it happen on a daily basis.
While we received the 2023 number one ranking in customer satisfaction and trust in the Southeast from J.D.
Power, our goal is to raise our client service levels even higher in 2024 and beyond. And as we cast our eyes
towards 2024, we are embracing a new mantra, grow the Bank. This signifies our shift back to a growth mindset
after a year where external challenges necessitated a more defensive stands. However, our pursuit of growth will
be marked by prudence, and we'll be fully aligned with our strategic goals and objectives. We will cultivate growth
by amplifying the client experience, streamlining touch points and continuing to be more proactive at providing
valuable advice to our clients. In addition our model facilitates delivering seamlessly across our lines of business
and products and solutions which will allow us to further deepen our relationships and increase our share of
wallet. At the same time, we're committed to preserving an even improving key elements of our safety and
soundness profile here at Synovus.
Starting with improving our core deposit base to retaining levels of capital that put us in a strong position relative
to our peers. And lastly delivering credit metrics that prove the efforts taken over the last several years to diversify
and fortify the balance sheet especially during periods of economic stress. As we recommit to this growth journey,
we will continue our efforts to de-risk and enhance our profile amidst continued market uncertainties. Therefore
grow the bank in 2024 signifies our intent to build an even stronger, more client-focused and risk resilient bank
well equipped to navigate the complexities that will continue to present themselves this year and in the years to
come.
