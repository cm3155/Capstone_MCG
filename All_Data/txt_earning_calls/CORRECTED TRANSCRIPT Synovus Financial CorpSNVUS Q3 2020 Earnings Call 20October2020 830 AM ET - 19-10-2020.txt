Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Synovus Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be
in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask
questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Brown, Senior Director of Investor Relations Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Brown
Senior Director, Investor Relations, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, and good morning. During the call today, we will be referencing the slides and press release that are
available within the Investor Relations section of our website, synovus.com. Kessel Stelling, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, will begin the call. He'll be followed by Jamie Gregory, Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Blair,
President and Chief Operating Officer. Our executive management team is available to answer your questions at
the end of the call. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.
Let me remind you that our comments may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties and the actual results could vary materially. We list these factors that might cause results
to differ materially in our press release and in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. We do not
assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, early
developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. During the call, we will reference non-GAAP
financial measures related to the company's performance. You may see the reconciliation of these measures in
the appendix to our presentation.
And, now, here's Kessel Stelling.

Kessel D. Stelling
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's call. While I normally close
each call with a big thank you to our team, I want to really begin today's call with a thanks to all of our 5,000-plus
team members across our five-state footprint. Just last month, six months after converting to drive-thru and
appointment-only, our retail branch network reopened to walk-in customers. Although things are far from back to
normal, we're fundamentally a relationship bank, and I've enjoyed so much hearing from our frontline team
members who take such pride and pleasure in serving our customers in-person, even if it's across a Plexiglas
barrier or from a distance of six feet.
Our team's response to this ongoing pandemic continues to demonstrate what's unique about this company: our
culture of service, our focus on customers and communities, our adaptability in changing circumstances, and our
ability to execute. All of those along with continued economic recovery contributed to our strong performance in
the third quarter of 2020.
Before I turn the call over to Jamie, I'll share highlights of the third quarter on slide 3. Diluted EPS was $0.56 per
share compared to $0.57 last quarter and $0.83 a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.89 per share compared
to $0.23 last quarter and $0.97 a year ago. The primary difference between reported and adjusted figures for the

quarter was a $0.30 per share impact from a goodwill impairment of our mortgage reporting unit that Jamie will
detail shortly.
Period-end loan balances of $39.5 billion were down $364 million from the prior quarter with commercial loan
growth partially offsetting declines in the consumer portfolio. 1% of loans had a full principal and interest deferral
at the end of the quarter, down from 15% in May. Total deposits of $44.7 billion were up $471 million from the
prior quarter. Broad-based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion allowed us to accelerate our deposit
pricing and remixing strategy, which led to stable net interest income at $377 million.
The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 3.10%, slightly better than we expected, as headwinds from
student loan sales and bond portfolio repositioning completed in the second quarter were partially offset by the
favorable trends in deposit pricing and remixing.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116 million was strong, up $20 million from the prior quarter. The improvement
was led by quarter-over-quarter increases in net mortgage revenues of $8 million and core banking fees of $5
million. Adjusted non-interest expense of $269 million was down $8 million from the prior quarter, led by the
improvement of $5 million in employment expenses.
Provision for credit losses of $43 million were down $98 million from the prior quarter. The ACL ratio increased 6
basis points to 1.80%, excluding P3 balances. Past due NPA and net charge-off ratios remained relatively stable.
The CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 9.3% following strong core performance in the settlement of
transactions we executed in the second quarter. Our total risk-based capital ratio increased 46 basis points to
13.16%, the highest level since 2014.
Jamie will now share more detail about the quarter.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kessel. Before moving to slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on goodwill. We have been conducting
evaluations of goodwill in response to market volatility and expectations for a lower-for-longer interest rate
environment referenced by the FOMC in August. As a result, there has been a goodwill impairment for our
mortgage reporting unit of $45 million. This is a non-cash charge that has no impact to cash, liquidity, tangible
book value or regulatory capital ratios.
Beginning on slide 4, total loans declined $364 million in the third quarter as commercial loan growth helped offset
reductions from P3 loan payoffs of $77 million and strategic asset dispositions of single-service loans. Excluding
the impact of asset dispositions and P3 payoffs, we had net loan growth of $245 million in the quarter.
Commercial loans, excluding P3 balances, increased $291 million. Although pipelines are lower than they were
pre-COVID, we continue to see demand, especially in middle market businesses and our higher growth and our
higher opportunity markets such as Atlanta, Birmingham, and South Florida.
Consumer loans declined $578 million, led by the disposition of roughly $185 million of non-relationship
mortgages along with continued declines in our lending partnership portfolios. Additionally, a portion of the decline
can be attributed to the continuation of our GreenSky strategy, which we highlighted last quarter and which, to
some degree, is offset by an increase in balances within our held-for-sale portfolio.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
While we will continue to evaluate opportunities to efficiently manage our balance sheet, there are currently no
existing plans for material dispositions such as those we made the last two quarters. We expect loans, excluding
the impact of P3 forgiveness, to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter.
As shown on slide 5, we had total deposit growth of $471 million. More importantly, we're continuing to
strategically reposition the portfolio. Broad-based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion offset the
strategic declines in time deposits of $1.2 billion and broker deposits of $381 million. We estimate approximately
$2.3 billion or 80% of deposit balances associated with P3 loans remained on the balance sheet at the end of the
quarter.
The cost of deposits fell by 14 basis points from the previous quarter to 39 basis points due to a combination of
rates paid and deposit remixing. For context, this compares to a low of 26 basis points in the third quarter of 2014.
We continue to believe there are further opportunities to reduce deposit cost through CD turnover, repricing, and
remixing. These activities in an environment of lower-for-longer interest rates combined with strong growth in core
customer deposits should allow us to get our total deposit cost to the 26 basis point lows of the prior cycle.
Slide 6 shows net interest income of $377 million, stable from the previous quarter and included $12 million in fee
accretion from our P3 loan portfolio. There is $74 million of P3 processing fees remaining. Earlier this month, the
SBA announced a streamlined forgiveness process for certain P3 loans of $50,000 or less. Approximately, 7% of
our P3 balances fall within this threshold. There is approximately $10 million in fees associated with these loans,
which will be accelerated when we receive the forgiveness proceeds.
Net interest margin was 3.10%, down 3 basis points from the previous quarter. Consistent with our expectations,
the current level of interest rates combined with a 9 basis-point headwind from bond repositioning and student
loan sales executed in the second quarter put downward pressure on NII and NIM in the third quarter. However,
these headwinds were partially offset by a handful of factors, including further declines in deposit pricing and
favorable deposit remixing trends.
Our guidance from the previous quarter largely remains the same, and we continue to expect modest downward
pressure on NIM as repricing within our fixed rate asset portfolio is partially offset by continued declines in overall
deposit cost and further improvements in managing liquidity cost. Excluding the potential impacts from P3
forgiveness, we expect NII and NIM will decrease slightly in the fourth quarter.
It was another strong quarter for non-interest revenue, which is shown on slide 7. Core banking revenue improved
by $5 million from the second quarter, primarily due to increased transaction activity, as most components are
gradually returning to pre-COVID levels. Net mortgage revenue of $31 million remained elevated, primarily due to
increase in secondary revenues, driven by higher loan sales and gain on sale. Secondary mortgage production
was $654 million in the third quarter, which is an increase of $19 million or 3% from the second quarter's record
production.
We continue to see positive momentum in other fiduciary service business, including brokerage and trust. Assets
under management of $17.5 billion grew 6% from the previous quarter. Other income for the quarter included a
valuation adjustment for tax credits and gain from the previously mentioned mortgage portfolio sales. In the fourth
quarter, we expect stable revenues from core banking fees, fiduciary services, and capital markets income. We
expect to see declines in mortgage revenue and other income.
Slide 8 includes non-interest expenses, which were $317 million, or $269 million adjusted. Adjustments include $3
million in restructuring charges, primarily related to branch optimization as well as the $45 million goodwill

impairment previously discussed. This goodwill impairment is limited to the mortgage reporting unit and results
from a combination of factors, including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes in
refinancings that have reduced mortgage yields, and the clarity around longer-term policy actions designed to
keep interest rates low.
Total employment expenses were $5 million less than the previous quarter, primarily due to lower commissions,
lower head count, and reduced COVID-related staffing expenses. Total COVID-related expenses for the quarter
were minimal. We expect further head count reductions in the fourth quarter as part of the normal attrition and a
voluntary retirement offer we recently extended. The voluntary retirement offer is expected to result in a one-time
fourth quarter expense of approximately $14 million and have a two-year payback. These savings are part of the
Synovus Forward initiatives and will help offset expected increases to other line items such as travel and
advertising in 2021, as banking activity return closer to normal. We continue to focus on what we can control,
which includes prudent expense management. Excluding the upfront expenses associated with Synovus Forward
initiatives, we expect adjusted NIE in the fourth quarter will be in line with the third quarter.
Key credit metrics on slide 9. There were slight increases in NPA, NPL and past due ratios from the previous
quarter, but we currently do not see widespread deterioration in the portfolio. Our comprehensive reviews have
largely isolated the elevated risks to certain segments, including hotels and full-service restaurants, and we
continue to work with borrowers who have been most negatively impacted by the pandemic.
Provision for credit losses of $43 million includes net charge-off of $28 million or 29 basis points. Downgrades in
the hotel portfolio, one of the hardest-hit industries, accounted for $603 million of the increase in increase in
criticized and classified loans. There were $125 million in our hotel loans that had principal and interest deferrals
at the end of the quarter, which represents about 8% of the total hotel portfolio.
Our latest economic outlook includes an unemployment rate of about 8% as of year-end before declining
modestly in 2021. This, along with credit migration and other portfolio activity, resulted in allowance for credit
losses of $665 million, up $15 million from the previous quarter. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 6
basis points to 1.8%, excluding P3 loans.
The amount of provision for credit losses going forward will continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors
including economic outlook, loan growth, loan mix, risk rate migration, as well as the timing and impact of future
government stimulus. Heightened levels of uncertainty and those factors could result in reductions of allowance
less than net charge-offs. As the outlook becomes more stable and uncertainty declines, we expect changes in
allowance to rely more heavily on the traditional factors previously mentioned.
Preliminary capital ratios on slide 10 continued to build from a combination of earnings and balance sheet
activities completed over the past several months. These balance sheet activities include the settlement of our
second quarter bond repositioning and our ongoing efforts to reduce single-service loan portfolios, as we prioritize
our balance sheet for core client relationships. CET1 increased 40 basis points to 9.3% this quarter. That's an
increase of 35 basis points from the end of 2019, and was accomplished while increasing the reserve by $382
million. The total risk-based capital ratio of 13.16%, up 46 basis points from the second quarter, was the highest
since 2014.
We remain focused on supporting our overall capital position and are targeting the higher end of our CET1
operating range of 9% to 9.5%, given the heightened uncertainty in the current economic environment. We expect
core earnings will continue to support our capital position and allow us to achieve our strategic objectives with

consideration for our anticipated balance sheet growth and the payout objectives we've outlined previously. As a
reminder, we do not expect any share repurchases for the rest of the year.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide updates on deferments and some of our strategic objectives,
including Synovus Forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'd like to begin on slide 11 with an update on deferments. At the end of the third quarter, we
had $337 million in loans on a full principal and interest deferral, which was less than 1% of total loans. The
aggregate amount in deferment was well below the 3% to 5% range we estimated last quarter and down
significantly from the 15% we referenced in our first quarter 10-Q filing.
We attribute the lower P&I deferral activity this quarter to the strength of our borrowers and improving economic
environment and support provided through various government stimulus programs. Of the $337 million in
deferment at the end of the quarter, 50% or $169 million were in the consumer book. These were predominantly
consumer mortgage loans, which are largely comprised of physician and private wealth customers. The $169
million in deferments represents approximately 2% of total consumer loans.
Commercial deferments as of 9/30 were $168 million, or 54 basis points of the total commercial portfolio. Full P&I
deferments were largely concentrated in the hotel and full-service restaurant segments, which comprise 85% or
$143 million of commercial deferments at the end of the quarter.
We have not only seen a significant reduction in the level of deferments, we are also seeing strong performance
from those that have exited a deferral status. 94% have made a payment, while another 5% to 6% have not had a
payment due or were in a grace period at the end of the quarter. Only approximately 20 basis points of loans that
exited a deferral status were past due or moved to non-accrual status at the end of the third quarter.
In addition to the full P&I deferment program, we have continued to work with other borrowers who have been
impacted during the current crisis to provide flexibility in payment terms, which may include modifications, such as
interest-only or amortization extensions. Inclusive of these modifications, we estimate that total loans with
accommodations as of the end of September remained below 3%, which was at the low end of the range we
projected last quarter for full P&I deferrals.
Moving to slide 12 and the COVID-sensitive industries. We shared on the second quarter earnings call a second
round deferral estimate for each of these industries. Consistent with the loan portfolio in aggregate, these
industries also had a lower-than-estimated level of P&I deferments at the end of the third quarter. As we
mentioned on the previous slide, the hotel and full-service restaurant segments had a total of $143 million with a
full principal and interest deferment as of 9/30, well below the original estimates. The hotel industry continues to
be a segment that has been hit the hardest by the change in customer behaviors, which was reflected in the
downgrade Jamie mentioned earlier. But the vast majority of our portfolio continues to pay as agreed.
Despite the results to-date, we continue to closely manage and monitor this portfolio, as we do not see the
normalized return of revenues in the near term. We have, however, conducted in-depth reviews of the loans in the
hotel portfolio. And from a longer-term perspective, we feel that we are very well positioned in several ways.
These include low loan to value, high-quality hotel properties with great brands, and sponsorship from guarantors
with strong liquidity.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
As it relates to the restaurant industry, we have seen signs of recovery since the reopening efforts of April and
May. Quick service and fast casual restaurants in our portfolio have largely recovered based upon our cash inflow
data and, in some cases, are outperforming pre-COVID levels. Synovus has $365 million of full-service
restaurants. And using our portfolio cash inflow data, we estimate they are operating at an average of 85% of
revenue compared to the prior year. There were $18 million of full-service restaurant deferrals at the end of the
third quarter.
It is worth noting that we do not have any shopping center customers in a second-round deferral. While we
continue to closely monitor this portfolio, our customers have experienced improving rent collections during the
last quarter, overall, due largely to the strength of the grocery, pharmacy, discount and home improvement
segments. We are also seeing stronger recovery in in-line service provider tenants that alleviate much of the
concern from spring and early summer.
Retail trade, arts, entertainment and recreation, as well as oil-related industries also had no deferments in the
second round, and we continue to be optimistic as to the ability for our customers to weather the short-term cash
flow reductions experienced during the economic shutdown.
While the deferral trends are extremely positive to this point, we are keenly aware additionally mandated closings
from COVID surges in our markets would have the potential of impacting cash flows and would affect these
segments more quickly and severely. Therefore, we will continue to closely monitor and manage our exposure
within these industries. As a reminder, our credit review process that we initiated during this crisis serves as a
basis for determining whether a deferment is necessary and includes a thorough analysis of current conditions, as
well as incorporating forward-looking projections and sensitivities, including cash burn rate analysis.
Moving to slide 13, it provides an update on our portfolio's cash inflows consistent with what we shared on last
quarter's call. The graph shows continued improvement in year-over-year cash inflows, which serve as a proxy for
revenues. During the third quarter, we saw the portfolio year-over-year inflows improve from being down 6% in
June to being up 3% in July and then settling in essentially flat with the prior year in August. These results are
largely consistent with various industry metrics, as well as the conversations we're having with our customers
throughout our footprint.
In addition to cash flow improvements, we have also seen our customers making the necessary adjustments
within their expense bases to further reduce the impact the crisis is having on their bottom line. We've included
trends for some of the industries that were considered to be more sensitive to COVID, including accommodations,
retail trade, food services, and other services. Results in these segments show consistent trending with the
portfolio as a whole, but also note the deferring impact within industry segment, which has served as the basis for
many of the K-shaped recovery scenarios that had been developed and discussed more recently. We continue to
use this data to inform our bankers as well as support our COVID-specific deferment and portfolio management
programs.
As I close out my section, let me transition to a business and Synovus Forward update, which we've highlighted
on slide 14. We have maintained three primary focuses on the business front in 2020. Number one, proactively
manage the credit environment through the current economic downturn. As I've shared on the previous slides, we
feel good about our progress and results today in this area.
Number two, utilize our relationship banking approach to continue to serve our customers, expand share of wallet,
and attract new relationships. Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, we have continued to drive
core loan, deposit and assets under management growth, while improving service levels and adding new

technology to support our customers' changing needs. Throughout 2020, we have accelerated the deployment of
new digital tools and capabilities with enhanced servicing and online origination functionality.
With the overarching goal of making it easier to do business with us as well as the changing business dynamics
associated with COVID, digital user enrollment is up 10% year-to-date, and we've experienced a 30% increase in
the number of deposits being handled outside of our branch network. We have achieved this success as we
partnered with existing and new fintechs to efficiently and effectively deliver these enhanced capabilities. We fully
recognize and remain committed that when we get to the other side of the current challenges we face, we want to
be even better positioned to grow and win in our marketplace.
And that brings me to the third area of focus, Synovus Forward. We remain focused on the execution of this
program to drive incremental efficiencies and sources of new revenue now and in the years to come. Our original
financial objective of an incremental $100 million of pre-tax income remains the baseline for execution. We are
beginning to realize the benefit of several of these initiatives, while we kick off additional initiatives that will have
2021 deliverables and run rate benefits. As we progress with these, we will continue to update and fine-tune the
size and timing of the benefits.
On the expense front, we are executing on the $25 million third-party spend program with workstreams continuing
to be implemented through the early part of 2021. Our plan for 13 branch closures in 2020 remains on track with
additional back office real estate consolidation plan for 2021. We are also in-flight with our overall organizational
efficiency program. This program is a comprehensive portfolio consisting of many initiatives that will deliver
reductions in personnel and other expenses as well as cost avoidance and additional areas throughout the
remainder of 2020 and 2021. Execution on these initiatives are underway, as Jamie noted, the reduction in head
count during the third quarter.
Another example of progress is the voluntary retirement program, which we announced during the third quarter
and will largely be completed in the fourth. As Jamie mentioned, it is expected to have a one-time charge of
approximately $14 million and have an earn-back period of less than two years. We will continue to update and
provide further details as we execute on the overall organizational efficiency program, and we remain confident in
our ability to generate up to $65 million in savings overall. As we've previously noted, we will continuously
evaluate the underlying economic environment to gauge the size and the timing of our overall expense
management program.
While we've been more focused on the efficiency initiatives out of the gate, we are progressing the revenue
opportunities that were identified during the diagnostic phase with continued confidence in the pre-tax income
range of $35 million to $55 million. We have kicked off our pricing-per-value and customer analytics workstreams.
These initiatives have the potential to begin creating revenue enhancement in 2021 through the repricing of
solutions and products as well as enhancing tools and capabilities to improve sales and retention efforts. The
dedicated teams leading these efforts are adjusting and enhancing the program on a continuous basis. As we
complete the programs and the execution in in-flight phases, we have additional initiatives that we'll commence,
which are all part of our longer-term strategic roadmap and change management plans.
With those comments, now let me turn it back over to Kessel.

summarize, we expanded the talent and expertise of our already strong and diverse board. We were named by
Forbes as the Best Employer for Women. We celebrated as two of our senior-most female leaders at our
executive and board levels were recognized for their contributions to our company and our industry.
And we formed a council comprised of some of our most senior African-American leaders to ensure accountability
for continued progress in promoting racial equality. We've made significant investments in education including
donating $1 million to the United Negro College Fund to provide scholarships for African-American students who
want to attend historically black colleges and universities or other higher learning institutions across our five-state
footprint.
We've continued supporting our communities through increased outreach and financial investments as
organizations, schools, individuals, families and entire communities face unprecedented challenges, and we
continue to deliver financial education across the footprint through our, now virtual, Raise the Banner program.
And, finally, we've remained active participants in multiple CARES Act stimulus programs to help our customers
recover sooner rather than later. We're proud of these actions, and we believe they reflect our deep sense of
responsibility for leading and strengthening the communities we serve.
And, with that, operator, let's open the call for questions.

In terms of the goodwill impairment charge, could you just help us understand what's different about your
mortgage business versus other banks that are not taking impairment charges?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Ken, Good morning. This is Jamie. I'll just jump right into that. I think that I can't really compare us to other
banks. What I'd say is, you look at that reporting unit and it's one of the highlights of 2020. You look at the activity,

the fee revenue, the growth you've seen there, the production, it's really been a success story. But the goodwill
calculation is based on when you originally make that valuation and what is the current long-term outlook. And
what's changed for us is that long-term outlook has really no rate increases. And so, when you have a long-
duration assets like mortgages on the balance sheet and you don't get any benefit from interest rates for
extended, multi-year periods, it hurts the valuation of that reporting unit.
So, it has really nothing to do, in my mind, with anything comparing us to others or comparing the performance of
the unit. It really has to do with this low-for-longer interest rate environment and the impact that has to the ROA of
a business that has long-duration assets on the book. And so that's the story on the goodwill impairment and the
mortgage reporting unit.

That helps. And then next question, what's the yield on the new loans that you're putting on in 3Q? And then also
is it fair to assume that your total portfolio loan yields will trend down to that level over time?

Yeah, Ken. The yield – going on yield in the third quarter was in the low to mid-350s, and if you think about our
book yield on our loan portfolio in the low-390s. It's hard to say where spreads will go. But it is safe to assume that
we will drift towards that lower end over the maturity of our loan portfolio. But I'd tell you that when we look at that
and we think about the margin. And when you're really looking out to the horizon, we see the headwinds of the
loan book repricing, we see headwinds of the securities book repricing. But we believe that the opportunities on
the deposit side, on the liability side will be a strong mitigant to those headwinds. And so that's how we're looking
at the margin when you think about it over the long term. Clearly, in the third quarter, you saw success on the
liability side and we're committed to continuing that.

that imply that you actually might consider buybacks in early 2021?

Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, Ken, when we think about capital in aggregate, first, as you mentioned, we're very pleased with where we
are. And when we think about capital adequacy and balance sheet resiliency, we really look back to – all the way
back to pre-crisis. And so, you think about coming into this year to 8.95% CET1. We have increased that 35 basis

points till September 30, but we've also, at the same time, increased our allowance significantly. And so, we feel
good about the progress we're making there.
We came – we went out publicly this quarter saying that we're targeting the higher end of the range of 9% to 9%
CET1 and that's our priority. We just see uncertainty in the environment. And so, we're looking to continue
building capital. And share repurchases just are not at the top of our list. As you saw in the third quarter, we grew
core loans, core organic loan growth of $245 million. That's our priority. We want to deploy capital to serve our
customers. And that's – when we think about what is front and center in front of us, like that's our focus is
deploying capital for our customers. And share repurchases, that's just what falls out of this at the end.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for providing all the color on credits and the deferrals, but would love to spend some time on just
the interplay as we look forward around credit provisioning costs outside of any growth. Talk to us in terms of
given the work you've done, your expectations around migration? And how much of that loss content of expected
migration has been reserved for versus what maybe – what may require additional reserve? And just if you could
talk through in terms of that and how we should think about provisioning and reserve build going forward, I think
that would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim. As we look at the allowance, and we think about what does it look like going forward, obviously,
with $665 million, the ACL this quarter, we feel that that covers our future charge-offs. Now, embedded in that is
some uncertainty. And so, we have increased the weightings to adverse scenarios this quarter. And so, that's
embedded in our calculation. And as we go through this crisis, as we get more certainty on charge-off and the
outlook, we would expect the weightings to alternative scenarios to decline and that could benefit the allowance or
not.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
And so, that's an important consideration. The migration that you saw in the third quarter, that impacted the
calculation. And we expect – as we look forward, we do expect to see all of this flow through NPAs, charge-offs
as we go through the cycle. And so, as we look at the allowance where we're comfortable with where we are at
$665 million, 1.8% on loans excluding P3, and I think that sums it up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Ebrahim, it's Bob. If I could just follow up on the migration piece, Jamie, that you mentioned, just to kind of
maybe put a little more color around the increase you saw there in criticized, classified, a large portion of that is
our hotel book. And while we do expect to see this type of migration to Jamie's point, a lot of that portfolio,
Ebrahim, was, as you know, was low loan to value, strong debt service coverage, et cetera, had a tremendous
drop-off in revenues. So, the risk rating process is pretty thorough and has to follow that drop-off in revenue. But
we don't expect that entire criticized, classified book to migrate all the way through to non-accrual and charge-
offs. So, it's on a case-by-case basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just switching to Jamie, I think you mentioned a slight decline in NIM, NII. But
just talk to us in terms of how we should think about the loan-to-deposit ratio given the liquidity, the potential
runoff in deposits when PPP is forgiven. Do you expect that loan-to-deposit ratio to move back closer to the high-
90s as it was pre-COVID? And does that mean you continue to run off time deposits, broker deposits for several
quarters to come?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, let me decompose that into the two parts. As we look at the loan portfolio, we're expecting loans
to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter. And so we're not expecting to see much growth there for the rest of this
year. But when we look further out, and we will give 2021 guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call in January.
But when we look further out, we do expect to return to normalcy and we do expect our customers to be looking
for liquidity for themselves and to be borrowing. And so, as we look forward, we expect to resume loan growth like
you saw pre-crisis. The opportunity in the Southeast is as great as ever, and we're ready for that. We're
positioned for it. I think it's why you see some loan growth in the third quarter. And so, we believe that loan growth
will resume in 2021.
The deposit side is a little murkier given everything that's going on including the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.
And so, it's more challenging to forecast on the liability side. But I tell you that if this liquidity environment
continues, and if it stays similar to what it is today, then, yes, you will see us using this liquidity environment to
optimize primarily our liabilities. So, what you've seen earlier this year is we've reduced our borrowings, our
wholesale borrowings at home loan bank. We've reduced our broker deposits. We've reduced pricing. And so,
that's where the largest opportunity is for us with the excess liquidity. And so, I think that's what you would
continue to see in the near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Jamie, I was just going to add – Ebrahim, I'm sorry, this is Kevin. In terms of the P3 deposits versus the
loans, I mean, we have roughly $2.8 billion of PPP loans and roughly $2.3 billion in deposits. So, those were
largely offset one another with just a small gap in terms of what's already been spent from the depository side. So,

that's not going to create an inflection point that would increase the loans to deposit or the – yeah, the loan-to-
deposit ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just to follow up to what you responded to Ken's question earlier, should the basic expectation be that
the NIM continues to drift a little lower over the next several quarters, maybe not by much, but the direction is
lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, we do expect to see slight downward pressure. If you think back to July, we gave guidance of basically
flat from a $304 million area. Our outlook hasn't changed from that. Look, we're very pleased with the deposit
pricing we saw in the third quarter and the effort of the team in that regard. But we do expect to see some slight
downward pressure on the margin.

Regarding the increase in criticized loans, I appreciate the color you gave and that's driven by hotel and
restaurant. The increase is definitely larger than what we've seen at others that have hotel and restaurant
concentration. So, I just want to get a little bit better understanding of the drivers. I know your increases in your
criticized assets over the past couple of quarters have been less than peers. So, was there a degree of a catch-up

here? I mean, did you do a thorough review of the portfolio that drove that? And also, wanted to get your thoughts
on the outlook. Is there – is it fair to assume that incremental increases here may be less on that side? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, John. This is Bob. And I wouldn't call it a catch-up as much as I would call it, to your point, a pretty
detailed and thorough analysis with each of our borrowers. Our hotel group is – most of the hotels are in our
concentrated vertical group with our – a real good team of experienced bankers. We wanted to go through each
hotel very methodically, very carefully, look at their demand drivers, where those properties were, et cetera. So, I
think it was just more than an evidence of our thoroughness in the analysis versus trying to play catch-up there. I
certainly wouldn't use that term.
I feel like we did that in this quarter. We're kind of at a stable point. Maybe to your last point, I would expect to see
minimal migration. But I would qualify all of that by saying, we just don't know as we go into the fourth quarter
relative to hospitality. So, it is still – while it's recovered some, it's still operating in a fairly difficult revenue level.
So, we'll see how that plays out. We feel like we've graded appropriately today. We feel like our allowances is
reflecting our future expectation of losses in that portfolio. So, again, a lot of it's just going to depend on what the
environment is as we go forward into the fourth quarter and into 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then – and, accordingly, given what you just said in terms of the allowance, if
you don't see material incremental upside moves in criticized and classified, is it fair to assume that as those
charge-offs materialize and rise that they should go against the reserve and, accordingly, we don't see
incremental reserve additions and probably see releases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's right. You're thinking about that right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. Thanks. And then separately on the loan side, I know you did flag in your prepared remarks
some emerging demand that you've seen on the commercial side. I just want to see if you can kind of walk
through what areas that you're actually seeing a bit of demand starting to materialize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, John, this is Kevin. So, during the quarter, we actually saw growth in our C&I book as well as CRE, and it's
really broad base across many of our areas. Our middle market banking area continues to grow and a lot of that's
just takeaway business. We talked about in the second quarter where we were able to garner new relationships
through the P3 program and that program, by providing that initial loan, has led to additional business, which has
been helpful for us. But we had made a major investment in that wholesale middle market space, and it continues
to pay dividends in the current environment. We also are seeing growth in our specialty lending division, which
includes our premium finance group, as well as our structured lending, as well as asset-based lending. So, we're
seeing growth there.

On the CRE side, some of that is on draws on construction versus new origination. In general, total production is
down about 20% on linked-quarter basis overall, but the run-off and the attrition is down at a higher level. So,
that's what's generating the growth to the portfolio. But as Jamie mentioned earlier, part of this is a story of just
economic demand and we believe that will return at some point in the near future. And we feel like we're well-
situated to be able to take share and continue to grow with our customers as they grow.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wanted to maybe ask about the Synovus Forward initiatives. Kevin, I appreciate all the color that you gave in
your prepared remarks. Just curious how much do you think is maybe currently in the run rate? And as a follow-
up to that, specifically maybe around fee income, there's a big bump in kind of that other category this quarter. I
know kind of stars can align in a given quarter. But just curious, any additional color there? And maybe that's –
maybe we stepped up to a new run rate as part of the Synovus Forward initiative, but just any color there would
be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brad. One of the things we want to do in subsequent meetings is give a timeline on the realized benefit of
Synovus Forward. But we're very pleased with where we are, as you saw in the prepared document that we're
starting to execute on the third-party spend, which has a long-term run rate impact of $25 million. By the end of
the third quarter, we believe that we've been able to capture roughly $5 million of that, not for the full quarter, but
by the end of the quarter. And so, you'll see that roll into the fourth quarter and that will continue to increase.
From a branch real estate optimization perspective, as I mentioned, we have closed eight branches year-to-date
and on track to close 13. And so, we've got about $2.3 million of savings from those branch closures already in
the September run rate number. And it's important there is that we're starting to look at other back office
opportunities, not just the branch side, to be able to generate additional savings. Those will come early in 2021.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
The bigger item, as you can see on our chart, is this organizational efficiency initiative and it's going to represent
over $30 million of run rate savings and cost avoidance. Jamie said during his remarks and I mentioned them in
mine, we did roll out in the third quarter an early retirement program. That's going to result in a charge in the
fourth quarter of roughly $14 million but have a two-year earn-back. So, we're going to get a $7 million-plus
savings from that transaction or that initiative, and that will start to show up at the end of the year.
So, many of these initiatives is, I would say, at this point, probably about $7 million of expense to-date. More of
them will start to roll in in the fourth quarter, and the goal is to have all of the savings fully accounted for by the
third or fourth quarter of 2021. And you'll note that we put a plus at the end of the organizational efficiency. As I
said in my remarks, we're prepared to flex and increase that as the environment warrants.
As it relates to revenue, at this point, we don't have any of the revenue initiatives in the run rate, and so those will
begin to fold in, in 2021. And I'll turn it over to Jamie for the other expense question – or other income question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. If you think about other income, you're right to think that some of that is more one-time in nature. And I'll
specifically point you to about $5 million we had, about half of that was gain on sales, the mortgage loans, which
again is similar to the second quarter, the loan sales that we've been executing, the vast majority are at premiums
to book price, which is a testament to the quality of these loans. And so, that's one. And then, we also had a gain
on a solar transaction. So, those are more one-time in nature and impacted to the good Q3 other NIR.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. That's helpful. And just my follow-up, Jamie, would be, are you pretty much done with building the bond
portfolio? Do you anticipate continuing to add to it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
If you look at that in the near term, you should expect to see some increases there. It's hard to give good
guidance on as a percentage of loans, which is – or percent of assets, given the impact of P3. But as we think
longer term, somewhere in the context of 16%, 15% of total assets make sense for the bond portfolio.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just following up a little bit on the Synovus Forward and some of those longer-term additional
opportunities. I guess, maybe in a different way, what do you – are you targeting an efficiency ratio outcome from
this? Is that maybe an easier way to think of maybe the longer-term benefits of future moves on either revenue
changes or expense efficiencies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jared, this is Jamie. As we think about all of these initiatives, and this just permeates into how we run our
businesses, as we look at top-quartile performance. And, obviously, that's a very vague concept right now just
because it's difficult to – for outsiders and analysts to forecast longer-term earnings. But as we look at our plan
and how we look at one year out, two years out, we believe that we have a strategic plan that will get us to the
top-quartile performance. And so our goals and objectives will evolve as the environment evolves. And so we
manage it tactically. And so we will look at individual initiative and how we're performing on that initiative versus
what we put on the page internally, and then what we put on the page externally and show you. But just know that
our objectives are really guided by looking at top-quartile performance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then circling back on the growth that you're seeing, the new growth
opportunities on lending, it sounds like that's maybe more taking market share at this point versus broader
economic growth. But what are you seeing in terms of pricing? Are you seeing spreads improve? Are you seeing
competitors step back and able to pick up some on an incrementally better spreads? Or is it really just taking
market share and you're willing to be aggressive on pricing to do that at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Jared, there's really two numbers there that we want to talk about. Jamie talked earlier about just coupons or
yields. Obviously, the rate environment is putting some headwinds on that. But when we look at the production
that we're getting today relative to an FTP spread, we're actually seeing an expansion in our pricing overall and
it's been fairly sizable in terms of the improvement that we've been able to see. And that's, I think, a function of
our ability to pricing risk and uncertainty. It's our ability from a relationship banking approach to not focus on being
the low-cost provider, but rather that we're adding value, and when we add value, we can price appropriately for
those loans.
So, we're very optimistic. And I should tell you that when you're in this sort of environment, our bankers are doing
a great job of evaluating the full relationship and making sure that we are looking at relationship profitability
hurdles when we're onboarding new clients, because it's important that we're not only growing, but we're growing
profitably. So, we're pleased with the pricing we're getting. We think there's opportunity to mitigate what Jamie
talked about earlier in terms of the repricing of the portfolio just through better spreads on new production.

Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Kessel, I have a question on the hotel portfolio. You have a slide in the deck on it. But just curious as to what to
Synovus is seeing in the book at the higher-end price points of the properties in the portfolio versus the lower-end
price points? And I know you have it broken down by type of hotel you have, but I'm just kind of curious for more
color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Jennifer, I'll let Bob go into a little more detail. I think, in general, the book is more dependent on geography.
Those hotels that cater it to the business traveler and major urban market are certainly struggling a little more.
Those that still have some of the vacation traffic, some of the drive-to locations, are doing better.
In terms of price point, Bob, I don't know if you have that broken out in terms of performance, but I'll defer to you
to see if you do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Jennifer, it's Bob. Just a little bit more on that. Obviously, our book is, to Kessel's point, in good
geographies. We feel comfortable about how it's spread out around our footprint. Most of our book is leisure and
business related. So, we've got multiple demand drivers. It's not isolated to one. That's a key point for us. We
really zero in on that. And so, when we look at it in markets like, for instance, Charleston, South Carolina, where
you've got a high tourism-driven economy as well as business travel. So we try to measure those multiple
demand drivers and put weightings on what we think the most impact is by market.
But in terms of price point, I mean, at the higher end, obviously, that's a lot of group business, a lot of convention
business. And we don't have as much of that. That's a small percentage of our portfolio. We're primarily spread

Kessel D. Stelling A

Yeah. Jennifer, it's a little bit hard to tell. But I think you're correct in saying probably into the first or second
quarter of 2021 is where we would we would expect to see the increase in charge-offs. However, I would qualify
that by saying a lot of it is going to be stimulus related and, of course, vaccine related as it relates to COVID.

I wanted to ask one more on Synovus Forward. If I look at slide 14 and I add up the benefit that you've already
kind of ring-fenced on the expense side, you're already a little over the top end of your range. And it feels like you
guys can do better than the $100 million benefit. When do you officially move that target up?

So, Brady, it's a good point and you pick up on a line item that we wanted to draw everyone's attention to is that
we believe that through the initiatives we have already put in the execution phase and those that are in play that
we're at the high end of the range. And I think as we move into 2021, as Jamie mentioned earlier, part of this is
less about trying to figure out what the absolute number is, but rather what it's going to take to be a top-quartile
performer.
And that's why we put the plus side there to say that, as we provide 2021 targets, we need to flex this expense
number to be correlated to what we expect to see on the revenue side. So, we're going to continue to have a
structured approach to how we do this. This is intentional on how we rolled it out in terms of starting with third-
party moving to real estate consolidation now on the organizational efficiency. And as we shared with you back in
the first quarter, the number of initiatives that we evaluated during the diagnostic phase were numerous. And we
decided to move ahead with some, and we decided to lay others.
And so as we move through this on a orderly fashion, we'll continue to pick up new initiatives and we'll be able to
share with you in terms of the overall. And, quite frankly, how much of that is true run rate savings versus cost
avoidance, because I know your other question is going to be how much of that's in the run rate versus avoidance
of future spend. But we'll share more of that as we give out the 2021 financial targets in January.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then with Biden leading the presidential polls, he's talking about increasing the corporate tax
rate to 28% from 21%. Any idea, if that were to play out, how much of an impact that would be for Synovus?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, first, there would be a one-time impact to the good on DTA front, but then it is our estimate and
obviously, there are a lot of uncertainties with regards to clarity around the details of the plan. But it's our
impression that it would increase our effective tax rate by 6.5%.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just one real quick one on PPP forgiveness. Just curious
based on the timing of how quickly or not quickly the SBA is getting to process the applications and then actually
repay the loans, what your sense is that those – that remaining origination fees flow through the margin, whereas
maybe a quarter ago, we might have thought a lot of it would account in fourth quarter or maybe do we start
shifting more of it into first quarter of 2021 at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Kevin, let me just give you a few data points there. So, the $12 million you saw in P3 fee recognition in the
third quarter is indicative of what you should expect just without any forgiveness in the fourth quarter. So, that's a
good run rate. The $9 million you saw in the second quarter was basically, because it was a partial quarter and a
lot of its originations were midway through the quarter.
We have – so, 53% of our P3 loans qualify for the streamline forgiveness. But because they're smaller, it's 7% of
the balances. So, it's not tremendously significant when you think about it in balance terms, and there's about $10
million in fees associated with those loans. So, for realization of those fees, we have to receive the proceeds from
the SBA.
So, we're appreciative of the streamline, because anything that makes the process easier on just a shade more
than half of our P3 loans, we're very thankful for that. But I would say, it's highly uncertain when we will receive
those proceeds. And if I was estimating today, I would say it's a first-quarter event. There's always a possibility it
could be in the fourth quarter. But I would push it out to the first quarter of 2021.

Good morning, Anthony.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. I want to go back to the criticized loan increase from the prior quarter. You call out that there is
$600 million sequential increase tied to hotel loans. Give a breakout of how much of the $600 million was tied to
hotels that are exclusive on business travel and convention center versus vacation and leisure hotels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Anthony, hey, this is Bob. No, it's a mix. We don't have a specific category. I would classify that the hotel
portfolio, in general, saw the downgrade. It was not targeted to one class of hotel. So – again, most of our hotel is
business and leisure travel, so that's – you're going to get an equal sort of distribution across that. And the same
is true with markets as well. I would continue to emphasize, though, that these folks were in pretty good shape.
We had strong equity levels and good debt service coverage as a company and so, that helps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. And a follow-up on that, do you know how occupancy rates have trended over the past quarter specifically
for the $600 million of loans that moved into criticized versus occupancy rates for the overall $1.6 billion hotel
exposure you have?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. [ph] Anthony, (01:03:53) what we're seeing really is a little bit of a separation between secondary markets
and tertiary markets and in our primary gateway markets such as Atlanta and Miami. We've really seen it in,
improvement is not the right word, but stronger ADRs and occupancies in the smaller sort of secondary tertiary
markets versus the larger markets. So, I would call that out to you. And we have a number of those in our
portfolio, specifically to the $600 million that kind of migrated over – all of our portfolios experienced – all of the
hotel portfolio have experienced some stress. But, nonetheless, you did have $600 million or so that moved to
rated status. That's sort of an equal distribution. It's not again concentrated in one market or the other or
specifically, as it relates to ADR and occupancy, again, it's all relatively the same, just a significant hit to top-line
revenue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And I think it's another data point, Anthony, I'll just point you back to slide 13 where we showed within our portfolio
the cash inflows that we're seeing on the accommodation portfolio where you have seen last quarter it would have
hit a low watermark of 50% reduction in inflows. We saw this quarter that it came back into the 21% to 28% range,
depending on the month. So, we are seeing improvement across the board. But as Bob mentioned, there is still a
year-over-year decline in terms of occupancy and obviously, cash inflows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And let me just add one other point there, Anthony, because I know Jennifer asked about hotels as well. So,
there's certainly a very strong focus here in the past week. Everybody on this call plus maybe a dozen others from

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
our credit and evaluation teams participated in a deep-dive call on this entire hotel book. And I think what came
out of it for me and we looked at what was in construction, what was seasoned – what came out of it for me was
really the diversity of that book and Bob talked about it. But it's diversity of geography, it's diversity of flag, strong
sponsorship, diversity of, again, very seasoned operators that have been through downturns before certainly not
like this.
So, it, in many ways, although there's certainly concern about that book, gives me confidence that our
underwriting is good, flags are good, sponsors are good. And even from a dollar concentration, not to bring up
events of the past but, again, the company now just doesn't have big single asset real estate concentration. So, I
think there are a number of factors there that, although we certainly have concern about that book, give us
confidence that the book will weather the storm, where there's still enough unknown out there that I think Bob and
his team are doing really good job of evaluating on a property-by-property basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And my last question is, what was the driver of the other $300 million sequential increase in
criticized and classified loans? Was this mostly full-service restaurants or was it pretty fragmented? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Anthony, it was pretty fragmented. There were a couple of larger commercial credits that migrated. But all
in all, I would say, it was pretty fragmented.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
So, I guess, maybe just to, I know, not beat a dead horse, but you did mention you did a full deep dive in the hotel
book. And so, you had the rating downgrades in the hotel portfolio, but the NPL and pass-through ratios are still
zero. And so, I guess when we think about migration from criticized and classified into NPL, I know some of that's
going to hinge on borrower-specific events. But just given the deep dive you all performed, could you give us a
sense for, I guess, maybe when you would expect some of that migration to occur and potentially what the size
could look like?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2020
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brody, this is Bob. A couple of comments, and Jamie can talk about the reserve a little bit more, if he'd like.
But, again, that portfolio doesn't necessarily sit in rated status on its way to NPL and charge-offs. So, I just want to
make that point. We're going to grade the portfolio based on how those assets are performing at this point in time,
and they all had a significant revenue decrease. So, when we went in, as Kessel mentioned, deep dive into the
portfolio, a lot of analytics around recovery rates, expected recovery rates, the velocity of that recovery, et cetera,
and made those assessments on a portfolio – on a loan-by-loan basis.
So, you're going to have them in the rated book, but we do expect a number of those will slide – will move back to
past status. Now, again, as I cautioned earlier, a lot of that depends on where we go over the next quarter or so.
So, I wouldn't want to put it on a pathway to charge-off or on a pathway to non-accrual. But I would want to tell
you that it's in a rated status, primarily because of the decrease we've seen in revenue that most of the hospitality
industry is experiencing.
As a side note, real quick, our seasonal hotels this summer saw a fairly significant increase. To Kevin Blair's point
earlier, we've gotten some of that revenue back. So, we're crawling our way back out of this revenue hole. But,
again, it begins to be property-by-property, and we expect some of them will move back to pass. And some of
them are not naive enough to think, we will have some problems in that portfolio. But I think over the next quarter
or two, we'd begin to be able to ring-fence even further where those challenges are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Bob, just to add, to call your attention back to slide 12, we had originally estimated of that book, probably
$400 million to $550 million of that book would go into a second round deferral. In fact, only $125 million of that
book has gone into a second round of P&I deferrals. So, to Bob's point, the risk rating doesn't have to do with
necessarily performance with us. They're paying as agreed. It has more to do with, again, the outlook on the
industry and certainly the cash flows that are depressed. So, like Bob said, they're not all on a path to NPL. I hope
majority are actually not on path to NPL, but actually on the path back to higher ratings over time, again, certainly
dependent on the pandemic. But I think there was actually – I know, you're focused on the migration and rightfully
so. But from our standpoint, it was almost a positive surprise, as it relates to the performance of that hotel book in
the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. So, it sounds like maybe then looking at that cash flow slide, maybe that could give us some indication as
to how you all are thinking about criticized and classifieds moving forward, because it sounds like that was a key
determinant in some of the downgrades currently. Correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's correct, Brody. That's just one data point. I mean, obviously, we're working with our customers on
their own set of pro formas and matching it up quite frankly with what we're seeing in our credit analytics on cash
flows.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. And then, Jamie, just one on the CD book. I'm sorry, if I missed it earlier, but could you give us a sense
for CDs that are repricing, I guess, in the fourth quarter this year and then how many you would expect – how
much you have repricing next year as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. In the fourth quarter, we have and we've put in the deck $1.3 billion of core deposits, core CDs in the fourth
quarter. On top of that, there's another $400 million in brokered CDs in the fourth quarter. And just to give context
on rates, those are all above a little more than 100 basis points above our CD kind of going on yield. Now, as
you've seen in the third quarter and the second quarter, it's not certain that we will replace those with CDs in this
environment. And so, that's what you'll see in the near term. And then the maturities of higher cost CDs decline as
we get into 2021. And so, the opportunity is not as big, but when you look at total CD costs at – today our time
deposit expense is at $141 million, we believe we can get back to those prior cycle lows of 63 basis points. We
believe we can get there by the middle of the next year and so – on total deposit cost.
So, that's kind of how we think about the timing. When we think about our objectives of getting back to the lows on
total deposit cost, we think it comes in three different areas. And the first is what you're asking about in CDs. The
second is just an overall mix. And we've made a lot of progress there. We've gotten the mix back to where it was
pre-FCB, and that was an early objective for us. But we believe there are further opportunities to reduce cost by
mix changes. And lastly, this opportunity is not as big, but it's important to us as further reduction in the cost of
money market deposits.

Good morning, Steve. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just on your CRE book, just noticed there's an uptick on your office NPLs and charge-offs. Was it just one
property or just some color on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. Steve, that was just a small amount. I mean, it was not a specific property on the NPLs. Well, let me back
up. On office portfolio, there is a fairly large credit that we move to non-accrual one specific credit and that was a
bulk of it. We had some smaller ones as well. That portfolio, though, as a whole, I think, continues to perform for
us. I know there's a lot of eyes on office and, certainly, there's some long-term trends there that we're watching.
But the other thing that's about our office portfolio that we do like is that it's got a lot of medical-related MOB type
of property in it. And we feel pretty good about that space. So, that's a $400 million to $500 million piece of that
book. So, you kind of got to scale it down a little bit. But the NPL was one larger credit, and then just smaller
migration, in general.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Appreciate the color on that. And then just a last question on – just the Synovus Forward, the $35 million to
$55 million revenue initiative. What's the breakout between non-interest income versus, say, net interest income?
And when do you think we should start seeing some of that trickle in? Would that be the first quarter of next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We'll start seeing some in the first quarter, Steven. It's hard to say right now between non-interest income
and net interest income, because you think about the two initiatives we've shared to-date. Pricing for value, that
really comes from two products. It comes from our treasury and payment solutions area, which will come in
through our analysis charges and that will be fee income. But the other part of that is, as Jamie just talked about,
the reduction in deposit pricing, and that will come in through NII.
In terms of the commercial analytics workstream that we just kicked off, that has three main workstreams. The
first one is in cross-sell and cross-sell comes from the treasury products. It comes from depository relationships,
lending relationships. So, again, it's going to be mixed across both of the categories. It also will reduce the overall
attrition of our portfolio, which again will come out of both categories. And the third, it's the risk management
framework that's going to allow us to be more efficient around renewals and things like that, so that's going to
show up more on the expense side. So, it's really going to be mixed. And as we start to roll out these revenue
initiatives, we'll start to fine-tune the actual benefits and we'll provide it to you by both NII and non-interest income.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you for taking all the time. Hey. Just wanted to look at slide 13 where you have the cash flows by month.
This is really helpful. Just as you think about the deep dive that you've done and the migration analysis that's
been talked about on this call, what are the assumptions as we move into the back half of the year and into the
winter months for those categories? I would think that those cash flows would actually start to move down. I just
want to make sure that that's captured kind of in your provision and migration thoughts? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's a great point and it would be easy to answer it at the top of the house. But what we've actually
done is gone industry by industry and provided future forecast based on what the assumed impact would be from
a static environment. But also as Bob mentioned earlier, if we were to see the virus spread continue, it could have
a bigger impact on certain industries. And so, the important part for us is to leverage it at this granular level to be
able to have forecast by industry level. There are some, as we mentioned in the earlier comments, from a K-
shaped recovery, there are certain industries that are performing well, and we think will continue to perform well.
There are others that have rebounded and gotten back to par, but there is a potential that there could be a
retracing of inflows reducing in the fall and winter months. So, we've evaluated that. So, a very long-winded
answer to say we're doing it at such a granular level. It happens at a four-digit NAICS code to understand what
the recovery looks like, and then we do sensitivities around that to understand what the impact would be to the
underlying customers' cash flow.

Very helpful. And maybe just one follow-up. You guys did – last year had announced a fair amount of hires in the
wealth management area. I think a fair amount those were in Florida. How does that relate into the efforts to drive
fee income growth? And could we expect some more net adds as we move forward in order to bolster fee
income? Thanks.

Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Michael, as you know, last year, when we closed on the FCB deal in January, we felt there was a opportunity to
grow the private wealth management fiduciary and brokerage business as well as our treasury business in South
Florida. And we took the opportunity to make those investments. And we feel today that we have the requisite
scale to be able to compete. We're winning in those areas. We're generating good growth. And in this sort of
environment where we see some uncertainty as it relates to top-line revenue, we've taken a pause in terms of
broad-based new talent attraction in some of those areas, if the return on the initial investment is greater than a
year.
And so, what we've done in the short term is we've limited our talent attraction to positions where we feel like
there's less than a one-year earn-back. Now that we have many positions, we can continue to invest in there,
whether it's our middle market bankers, commercial bankers, treasury, but we may take a pause into next year
before we start adding back those longer payback positions. But that shouldn't come at a cost for the top-line
numbers, because we're still seeing good growth there and we feel like we have the requisite scale to be
meaningful in those markets.

Hey. Thanks, guys. I know the call is running long. Kessel, you mentioned the path on concentrations and I think
that's a great point. I was also curious if we just kind of think big picture, the criticized assets we see today with all
the disclosure, they still pale in comparison with what happened 12 years ago, which I think is important just
because I think you've made so much progress since the last credit cycle and you're in a much better position
today and it doesn't seem like you're even close to getting back to where it had been in the past.

Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Chris, thanks for the reminder. But, no, I couldn't agree with you more. I lived it, you lived it, and we had big
chunky assets. We had big chunky concentrations. If you even look at the CRE concentration now, that 27%
number and like 2% is C&D and land. And last cycle, that was CRE number, I guess, peaked at 46%. And that
one particular asset class was 30%. So, now, you're seeing again more diverse, again, across geography, asset
class. Again, no big concentrations in the average real estate loan, $12 million-ish or something like that, so – and
quite frankly, a totally different [Technical Difficulty] (01:22:50-01:22:56)

All right.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my question again. Just very quickly, Jamie, you've guided for expenses, core expenses to
stay relatively flat next quarter. Talk to us, I mean, if we see some seasonal decline in mortgage banking income
in the fourth quarter, should we expect some expense offset tied to that, or do you expect to use that and deploy
that elsewhere in the business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, great question. No, as we look at the fourth quarter, we do expect expenses kind of to be – when
you back out any expenses with Synovus Forward to be flat, to be in line with the third quarter. And the reason we
are expecting commissions and salaries and benefits to decline, but we're also spending on some initiatives that
we've been working on this year in areas specifically in digital. And so we are rolling out products. We're rolling
out advancements that we've been working on.
We haven't kind of forgotten our core business and our core evolution in digital, and some of those expenses are
coming through in the fourth quarter. They're a little bit of an offset to that decline you would see in personnel
expense. But what I want you to – your takeaway to be on expenses is, in July, we gave guidance that the second
half of 2020 would have lower expenses than the first half. And we were committed to that. We believe in that.
What I'm telling you right now is just a continuation of that as what we thought.
But we are also committed to continuing that. And when we say top-quartile performance, when you have this NII
outlook in this environment of low rates for longer, we're fully aware of the need, the need to come out of the NIE

line. And as Kevin described with Synovus Forward, that's critical for us. And so, when we look at the first quarter
of 2021, we'd give you the same guidance that we gave you for the second half of 2020. And we expect the first
half of 2021 to be lower than the second half of 2020. So, I just want your takeaway to be that we are very
focused on the expense line, we're disciplined, and you should continue to see a decline in our expenses as we
move forward.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Crystal clear. Thank you. Because my follow-up to Kevin was going to be what it means for next year, given the
focus on what banks can earn from an ROE perspective. So, that was extremely helpful. Thanks, Jamie.

Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
Kessel Stelling for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Okay. Well, thank you. And I want to apologize to Chris Marinac, if he's still on the call. I think we lost our audio at
the very end. So, Chris, if I seem to abruptly cut you off, it was not intentional. So, apologies for that. And if there's
any follow-up, just let us know, and we'll be happy to do that.
So, thank you, all, again. It's been a long call. Quite frankly, it's been a long year. But we appreciate your
continued interest in our company and for your time and your patience today. We're in the homestretch of what's
been the longest year I've experienced and I think this is my 43rd earnings call, so I've experienced some long
years. But this has been a challenging one, but I think it's made us a better partner to our customers and our
communities. I think it's made us a better employer to our team members. I think it's really demonstrated the
strength and resiliency of our company and our ability to perform in good times and in challenging times.
So, again, we thank you for your time today. We begin this quarter with considerable momentum. I'll close again
with a thanks to our team. They are energized and exciting about closing this year in a stronger way as we can,
and look forward to speaking with all of you again in January. So, thank you very much.
