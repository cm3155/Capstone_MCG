...everyone and welcome to the Nine Month 2020 Earnings Presentation of Banco Santander. As every quarter,
we have as speakers our Group CEO, Mr. Álvarez; and our Group Chief Financial Officer, Mr. José Cantera. Our
CEO will address the group performance for the nine month of 2020 and then our CFO will follow up with the
business review in more detail before jumping to the key takeaways of the quarter by our CEO, and obviously
happy to answer your questions during the Q&A session afterward.
So, José Antonio, please, the mic is yours.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Sergio, and good morning to everyone. First of all, I hope that you and your families, friends,
and relatives are doing well. Let me to go straight to the third quarter results. I will qualify the results are – this
quarter a very positive quarter within the environment arising from the COVID crisis. We have improved
significantly the quarterly trends in business activity and results and activity. If the second quarter was pretty
strong on the corporate side, the third quarter will recover significantly, the activity coming more for individuals.
And this reflect the – in the underwriting of both mortgages and consumer lending as long as the growth in
deposits.
The profit in the quarter was €1.75 billion, 14% increase in underlying terms compared with the previous quarter,
18% higher in constant euros. All the regions are performing better than in the previous quarter. In the first nine
months, we maintained a solid top line performance. The pre-provision profit under this scenario, and I want to
stress you this, in constant euros grew 3%, driven by resilient customer revenue and our cost reduction plan.
In credit quality, I will elaborate later on in more detail, €76 billion out of the €115 billion – or €114 billion that we
had in moratoria of payment holidays already expired and the behavior has been pretty good. Only 2% went into
stage 3. Well, the future continue to be highly uncertain, but for this year, it's – we expect a lower cost of [ph]
written one (00:02:39) we got during the first Q. So, as 1.4%, 1.5% cost of risk. Now probably going to be around
1.3% for 2020.
On the capital side, we continue to build capital, with a strong capital generation 40 basis points in the quarter
after the dividend accrual of 13 basis points. This morning at the AGM, we present to shareholders and they
approved the scrip dividend of €0.10 per share and a cash dividend for next year to be paid in cash next year,
provide that the regulators allow us to do so.
So, if we go to the P&L, straight to the P&L, what we see is, first, I should mention the exchange rate. The impact
was significant in the quarter. You see [ph] both (00:03:37) in revenues is between 6 and 9 points in the different
3

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
lines of the account. This has been particularly strong in the real in Brazil, the impact, and you see the difference
in those two figures.
Excluding the impact of – looking at the business in constant euros, the income remained stable as the decrease
in activity and lower interest rates were offset by higher volumes, so much market volatility, and lower cost of
deposits. We accelerate our cost reduction and we have good news – good – perfect this for the coming quarters.
As a result of our underlying profits show significant resilience and net operating income rose 3% year-on-year in
constant euros.
Finally, higher loan-loss provisions due to COVID-19 related provisions, although this quarter came more in line
with the second than with the first quarter where we did the overlay that you already know.
In chart on the right, you can see how earnings speak stronger in the quarter with the following detail. By lines,
the revenue grew 7% quarter-on-quarter while growth in net interest income, highest NII in the last seven quarters
mainly driven by Spain, UK, US, and Brazil. So, pretty well-spread across the board. Upturn in net income as a
result of higher activity and this happens all across our 10 markets.
We recorded lower gains in the [indiscernible] (00:05:15) in the second quarter. CIB [indiscernible] (00:05:18) very
good quarter that we couldn't repeat in the third quarter. Costs were up 3% and this partly reflect adjustments that
we did in the second quarter due to the expectation of lower personnel cost in the year related with the low – the
expected performance. As a result, net operating income was up 11% quarter-on-quarter and higher than the Q3
2019 that I will say, as I said at the beginning, is remarkable. Loan-loss provisions fell 14% due to the high level of
provisions related to COVID-19 in the second quarter.
The main trends over the last quarter are supported by all the regions. You see all the regions growing revenues,
all the regions having a good cost control, and very positive pre-provision profit performance increasing in all the
regions with highly resilient NII and efficiency improvement.
Going to capital in the quarter, we finished the previous quarter 11.84%. We continue to generate capital with a
strong generation, 40 basis points organic generation in the quarter. We accrued 13 basis points in order to be
able to pay dividend next year [indiscernible] (00:06:36) so.
Additionally, we had several positive impacts from corporate transactions of 10 basis points mainly related with
the share buyback of SC USA and negative impact from regulation market and exchange rate. In Q4, we could
have a potential positive impact from the [ph] software (00:06:54) of around 20 basis points or slightly higher and
a negative change around 10 basis points for another regulatory impact. This is our – so, that's the reason why
we expect to finish at the end of the year around 12%. That is at the low – at the top end of our target range.
In relation with profitability ratios, remarkable that our efficiency ratio improved a little bit compared with 2019.
This is, again, remarkable. The underlying return on tangible equity recovers from the first half of the year, still far
away from the one we had in 2019. And the tangible net value stayed basically flat, but is suffering from the
continued depreciation of the currencies, particularly those currencies in Latin America and mainly the real, the
Brazilian real.
If we go to the business activity on the group, normally we don't go in that much detail with the activity, but let me
to guide, even the current situation in which we are living, let me to guide you where is the activity. The average
new lending is coming back to a more normalized levels. In the previous quarter, we have a strong government
support that underpin the growth in the quarter. Now, you see that we are lending €1.1 billion a day in constant
4

(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
euros, that it was pretty much the same figure that we had back in February. So, some kind of a normalization in
the volume of lending and – compared with the previous quarter.
If you go into more specific details, you have the mortgage and new mortgage lending by regions, and this has
significant recovery from the previous quarter. And the consumer lending, it happens pretty much the same. It
happens all across the regions. And we saw a substantial recovery in the third quarter compared with the second
quarter.
Well, in relation with SMEs and corporate lendings, you will see that we came back after the spike in the second
quarter when we were pretty active providing loans warranted by different governments to – particularly to SMEs
and corporates. It's coming back to a more normalized level where the government supported program is
nonmaterial at the end of the quarter in September. In CIB, large corporates, after the spike that happened mainly
in March, the situation is back to normal and is fairly, fairly stable at this point.
It may not surprise you. Everybody expect the retail sales are booming. And as a result of the pandemia and the
digital adoption of more and more customers by the day. Yeah. You have figures in the screen, the digital
customers, the digital sales are growing. And the mobile is the preferred channel that the customers are using
more and more. And this, in my view, will come here to stay in the future.
If we analyze a little bit the details of the P&L, well, NII was around €24 billion, no material change year-on-year.
Net income was strongly impacted in the second – mainly in the second quarter by lower transactions volumes
and regulatory changes in several units. From the global business point of view, both Wealth Management &
Insurance and CIB increased fee income and represented 46% of the total group fee income. This quarter, we
can [ph] again perceive a growth of (00:10:46) recovery of net fee income associated with normalization of
activity.
When it come to cost, I will say good developments here. Costs – nominal costs are falling in Europe, around 6%;
North America, 2.3%; and South America are growing 1.9%. Overall, the group nominal costs are falling 2.1%,
and we continue to expect positive developments in this front. In relation with Europe, we expect to achieve the
€1 billion we established last year in April. We expect to achieve at the end of this year since April 2019 till
December 2020 probably we're going to be there.
In relation with credit quality, at this stage, you see like two fronts. One from we're providing much more based on
the models and the scenarios. The scenarios we are using are not far away – are not pneumatic, but they are not
far away from the ones the IMF is using. And as a result of these, our provisions – loan-loss provisions are going
up, 58% year-on-year. And this is still the extra provisions basically remain in the balance sheet based on the
models and the scenarios we are using.
On the other side, on the credit quality side, we are not seeing a significant deterioration on the credit quality. So,
the cost of credit went up as a result of the provisions based on the scenarios and models. NPL's [ph] traditional
definition (00:12:21) still performing very well. Loan-loss service in the book in the balance sheet stood up around
€24 billion which represents 2.6% of the total loan book. On top of that, and this is the first line of defense in this
situation, our pre-provision profit is around €25 billion and is fairly stable the last couple of years.
So, finally let me to elaborate a little bit on the moratorias, the payment holidays. You have the figures that
probably you are familiar with. The total group moratoria was €114 billion. You have by products and by regions.
The main amount was in mortgages. The two-thirds of the moratoria – more than two-thirds is already expired.
And, well, you see behavior of those customers you have – well, those customers, 82% are Stage 1; 16%, Stage
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
2; and 2%, as I already mentioned before, in the Stage 3. You see by regions, you have pretty much, with some
variations, the same picture. What remains – and this is a behavior that, well, probably is better than the one we
were expecting a couple of months ago. And this is – well, you may say that the government programs protecting
incomes is helping a lot in this regard.
The amount of loans still in moratoria is close to €40 billion. You have the split there. Out of this €39 billion, €24
billion are mortgages, €3 billion consumer loans, and €12 billion SMEs and corporates. You see where these
payment holidays moratoria by countries. You have two countries that are relatively small in terms of the loan
book, Portugal and Chile, where the government spent moratoria for longer period of time, usually one year. So,
you're going to see these moratoria stay there.
And the other two is UK and Spain, that you see the figures compared with the loan book both in UK and Spain
are relatively small in the region of 3% to 4%, 5% of the total loan book. So – and this is – we don't expect a
behavior materially different than the ones that despite mainly taking into account that you have the figures in light
blue that around 89% in Spain and 93% in UK are secured loans to individuals.
So, I hand it now to José García Cantera, our CFO, to elaborate about the trends in the regions and the countries.
And I'll come back at the end to sum up and to give you our vision for 2021. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio. Good morning, everyone. Despite the global nature of the pandemic, our geographical
and business diversification continues to work. The very strong results that we had in the first quarter are
predicated upon a very – our diversification between the three regions and the businesses that José Antonio has
commented. We had positive year-on-year volume performance across all geographic regions and global
businesses. The decrease in the quarter is explained by the sale of Puerto Rico, the sale of a nonperforming loan
mortgage portfolio in Spain – I will refer to these two in a minute – and also lower volumes in CIB.
We had increase in pre-provision profit in North America, South America, and our global businesses, and the only
decreases that were recorded were in Europe. Excellent underlying profit of our global units with CIB growing
30% year-on-year and Wealth Management and Private Banking with a stable year-on-year profit, but activity
clearly picking up in recent months.
Now, we return to Spain, we have reached already 13 million customers and we continue to support families and
businesses through many initiatives for the recovery of the economy. For example, we have granted 180,000
payment holidays in mortgages and consumer loans. And we had a market share in the government support
program for SMEs and corporates of 27%. All the while, we remain prudent ensuring no deterioration in the
portfolio's risk profile. We reached more than 5 million digital customers with more than 300 million accesses in
the quarter leading in customer experience rankings.
In terms of commercial activity, loans fell 2% in the quarter due to the sale of this nonperforming loan mortgage
portfolio that I mentioned that amounted to €1.5 billion. But, obviously, we had an increase year-on-year boosted
by SMEs and corporate loans.
If we move to the income statement, profit was 53% higher in the quarter due to the positive performance of
customer revenue. In turn, due to the sharp increases in net interest income, up 11%, fee income up 5% quarter-
on-quarter. On a year-on-year basis, we recorded a decline in total income, which was obviously the result of low
interest income, smaller ALCO portfolio, the fall in net fee income due to reduced transaction volumes, and also
6

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
lower income from our real estate subsidiaries. We had a positive cost performance, dropping cost down 10%
year-on-year, and the non-performing loan ratio that dropped by 125 basis points in recent months, mainly due to
the sale of this non-performing loan mortgage portfolio. Looking ahead, we remain positive about the top line
performance. Net interest income and net fee income are more positive towards credit quality in individuals,
although somewhat less so for SMEs given the current environment and the uncertainty.
If we move to Santander Consumer Finance. We continue to see strong signs of recovery in most of the countries
where Santander Consumer Finance operates. While with new business, it's actually outperforming the market. In
the third quarter, underlying profits increased 10%, thanks to a almost 30% jump in net fee income which is linked
to volumes returning to pre-crisis levels. In the quarter, new business volumes were at 37%.
Looking at nine months, underlying profits continue to be heavily impacted by provisions. However, net interest
income increased 1% and costs were down 3%, thanks to our efficiency programs and COVID-19 actions
implemented in the second quarter. Cost of credit remains low for these type of business. Looking forward, we
would expect the new business in the coming quarters at similar levels to those recorded in the third quarter with
costs and loan loss provisions under control.
In the UK, we had a strong quarterly uptick in underlying attributable profit driven by a continued increase in
volumes. We are actually seeing very, very strong new demand for mortgages. Mortgage applications in recent
weeks has been very strong, and this should be reflected in the net interest income in coming quarters, also
driven by bounce back loans. We reduced the costs of the 123 account in May and in August, and this can be
seen in the reduced cost of funding. Increased fee income mainly due to CIB activity costs that remain under
control, while loan loss provisions were significantly lower in the quarter, down 19%, with the cost of credit below
30 basis points. In terms of nine-month results, continue to be impacted by COVID in addition to regulatory
changes affecting overdrafts although somewhat compensated by lower costs. Looking forward, we expect to see
similar trends to those that we've seen this quarter, improving net interest income, and continued efficiency
savings with no significant changes in loan loss provisions. This, of course, is conditioned by the Brexit
negotiations.
If we move to Brazil, has once again recorded an excellent quarter both in terms of results and volumes while we
remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. Positive performance in mortgages reaching record high in
new mortgage lending in the last month, in the month of September. In cards, just in September for instance, we
sold 450,000 cards and in wholesale banking. Very positive evolution also in Getnet and the auto finance
subsidiary. Underlying attributable profit rose 21% quarter-on-quarter driven by consumer revenues. Costs were
3% higher, half of the growth in cost is explained by the collective labor agreement.
Provisions declined in the quarter. We don't foresee a worsening in the cost of credit in the coming quarters. We
expect it to remain stable or even improve slightly, given the current economic forecasts. Brazil economic outlook
continues to improve. The IMF forecasts regarding GDP growth in 2020 improved from minus 9% in June to
minus 5.8% recently. Analyst consensus actually is even better than these, expecting a drop in GDP this year
between 3% and 4%. And the current account deficit is 1%.
These, with all of these, we would expect the Brazilian real to show a better performance in the coming quarters.
In short, Brazil has again proved its balance sheet and results strength despite the current environment and we
remain optimistic about the future both in terms of profits and absolute amount of profits and also in terms of
profitability.

In the United States, during the quarter, SHUSA increased its ownership stake in the consumer finance entity to
80.25%. And we completed the sale of the retail and commercial bank in Puerto Rico. These sale amounts to
€2.2 billion in loans, and €3.5 billion in deposits, which obviously explains why volumes show this performance.
However, we had a strong year-on-year growth excluding these in loans and consumer loans, and consumer
funds boosted by corporate demand and incentive programs. In the quarter profits were 79% higher mainly due to
lower provisions, lower cost of debt, better performance in leasing and control cost. Underlying attributable profit
decreased 24% year-on-year, primarily due obviously to COVID provisions. Net operating income was flat and the
reduction of costs down 5% offset total income decrease.
In Mexico, most branches – the bank continue to operate normally with reduced staff. And we also saw digital
activity picking up substantially. Loan growth year-on-year was driven by the corporate side. While credit cards
continue to be affected by lower activity arising from lockdown measures. Compared to the previous quarter, the
profit increased slightly as lower loan provisions and higher customer revenue were offset by the fall in gains on
financial transactions which were especially or exceptionally high in the second quarter, [ph] and the rise in costs
(00:24:28) driven by several projects and higher IT expense. On the other hand, we had good performance year-
on-year due to better revenue performance and improved efficiency.
Profit was weighed down by higher loan provisions. Cost of credit stood around 3% and we expect a stable or
even decreasing ratio in the coming quarters. These results show a very positive trend in customer revenue,
reflecting the improvement in our franchise and a high profitability with a return on tangible equity of 15%.
Lastly, in the corporate center, we can see the results improved 11% compared to 2019. On the one hand, we
had positive impacts coming from gains from financial transactions amounting to €440 million, basically foreign
currency hedging and the positive trend in operating expenses continued improving 12% compared to last year.
On the other hand, we had a negative impact on NII [ph] of the larger (00:25:31) liquidity buffer, and other results
and provisions increased due to one-off provisions for certain stakes whose values were affected by the crisis.
And now let me hand it back to our CEO for his closing remarks.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
A couple of minutes. Conclusions for 2020 results, I will say strong capital build following continue organic capital
generation. Strong operating performance taking into account the scenario, increase in underlying profit in the
quarter. We have robust credit quality and we set a new cost of credit estimation for the full year 2020. As our
Chairman said in the AGM, with these trends and with the result we already got, we expect in the whole year to
be around the €5 billion mark net profit for a very, very complex year.
Talking about the outlook for 2021. I should recognize that this is a very brave exercise given the uncertainty that
is around – coming from the health situation, the effects on how long it's going to last, the COVID-19. We expect
positive trends in revenues, particularly in Europe due to – we expect the re-pricing on liabilities continue to go
forward and also some help for higher lending volumes, mainly the Americas, in 2021. In net fee income, well,
CIB and Wealth Management should continue to deliver relatively well. In costs, I already told you last quarter that
we were more optimistic about our capacity to reduce costs, and we are committing now an additional €1 billion
net savings reduction in the next two years in Europe as a result of our One Europe project.
Thanks to the quality and diversification of our balance sheet, better than expected customer behavior, as I
explained before, and based on – well, the current estimations mainly coming from IMF, we are confident that we
8

will maintain or continue to improve the cost of credit in the P&L once we use the overlays we build along the
year.
Regarding capital, we are at the top end of the range in our target range and we will have more flexibility going
forward in the way we match and allocate capital and the way we remunerate our shareholders. [ph] We continue
to make (00:28:33) capital organically without sacrificing either business growth or improving of our long-term
return and we expect an underlying return on equity in line with our traditional cost of equity.
As the Chairman explained this morning in the AGM, we are unlocking our potential for organic growth going
forward. Our scale creates significant opportunities for organic value creation which we realize through structural
change, the One Santander that we are starting in Europe, the combination of a Openbank and Consumer
Finance, and creating one of large payment platforms in the world on the back of Getnet [indiscernible] (00:29:17)
for SMEs. This will allow us to generate more revenues and additional cost efficiencies. In summary, I would say
our business model diversification and the change we are doing provide a strong platform to continue to generate
value for our shareholders.
Thank you. And now, we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from again from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to start with asset quality. If I may, in particular, the
new cost of risk of guidance of 1.3%, if you can give us details of what shall we expect by – for the main business
areas and where the reduction comes from? I understand this is mainly from Brazil and SCUSA. What will be the
new cost of risk you are expecting in these two regions and what makes you more comfortable for these two
units? Also any other relevant changes in other unit for the good or for the bad, consumer finance in Europe or
UK, Mexico?
And then also in particular, Spain, the transformation ratio into NPLs from the moratoria is the highest of all the
units, 7% [ph] and the macro it tackles (00:31:03) so what shall we expect in terms of cost of risk for Spain for this
year and next year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to take – to elaborate on the asset quality, the new cost of risk guidance. As you rightly elaborated,
if we look [indiscernible] (00:31:22) the quarter, the main business areas that came better than expected
9

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
particularly was SCUSA in the US, where the behavior both in originations and recoveries on the back of the price
of the used cars in the US produced significant reduction in the net cost of risk. The same happened in Brazil,
probably you see this morning that Central Bank of Brazil published that the number of families in default now is
the lowest in the last nine years. So, it shouldn't surprise you that as a result of this, our view about the cost of risk
in Brazil going forward is fairly, fairly positive. And I would say we remain stable or maybe may go down in the
next year. We, as you know, we build the overlay. We haven't used the overlay. And with the current trends we
are seeing, we are fairly optimistic on this.
So, other relevant changes that you mentioned, you mentioned UK, you mentioned Mexico, we don't see major
change there. And finally, you mentioned Spain where the provisions this quarter went up. And well, as you know,
we have a large SME book in Spain in which we did a significant overlay, but is the most sensitive area going
forward SME books. And well, we need to be prudent on this because, as I elaborate at the beginning, uncertainty
is still pretty high. It's not the same to have a pandemia that lasts for another six months than having a pandemia
that lasts for nine months or one year mainly in Spain where the tourist sector plays a significant role in the overall
economy, and while small variations in the timing of the pandemia may produce significant impacts on this.
But overall, I feel confident with the trends in relation with the asset quality overall. Well, you mentioned, I forgot to
elaborate in consumer finance in Europe, the behavior has been pretty, pretty good. Yeah. So, I'm relatively
confident that with this scenario we are in, the scenario [indiscernible] (00:33:55) the cost of risk will go down next
year in the consumer finance in Europe. So, those are the trends we are seeing across the board. Overall, we
remain constructive recognizing again the uncertainty of this scenario is pretty high.

Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning, good afternoon actually. It's a confusing time. Two questions on cost and capital, please. On cost,
you've announced the €1 billion further cost synergies. Can you maybe give us a bit of color of where that's
coming from in terms of regions of businesses? If that's going to materialize in a big charge to fund that in Q4
maybe. And related to that, is your consideration is because it's a very, very material cost cutting exercise, is that
– should we expect any impacts in terms of market share volumes, your ability – your commercial sort of reach
could be affected by such as a cost cutting plan?
And secondly, the question on capital. You've had 15 basis points regulatory impact in the quarter. I think you've
called out a further 10 basis points left. If I look beyond Q4 what are the regulatory impacts that are left if we put
aside Basel IV? And in general, you've obviously accrued a dividend, what gives you such a high confidence that
you've proposed it to the AGM [ph] would they approve (00:35:40) the €0.10 dividend? You're I think the second
bank in Europe that does that. How confident are you that the SSM is going to allow those dividend payments?
Thank you.

Let me take the first question and I will pass José the capital one and maybe elaborate about the dividend and the
ECB. On the cost, the €1 billion I was referring to was €1 billion for the project, the One Europe project. Where
this cost reduction comes from is mainly from the UK and Spain although we have also some cost reductions in
Portugal and Poland. But given the size of the different franchise, I will think – I will tell you that is more or less
related with the current size of the franchise, probably going to accelerate a bit more in the UK, and Spain that is
now minus 10% is going to be the pace of the reduction is going to be lower than the current 10% [ph] and the UK
having the opposite (00:36:47) and there are some cost cutting in the Portugal and Poland.
So, you raise a very good point, the commercial reach and the how much this may affect our capacity to keep
volumes and market share. I do expect that with the current trends and the current trends are fairly, fairly well
established I will say. So, it's not just the pandemia, before the pandemia, transactions in the branches were
falling at 8% a year, digital transactions were growing at 40%, the pandemia accelerate this. And on top of this,
when you look at sales, the volume of sales to digital channels continue to increase, and more and more entering
to territories of high value-added products, so like the ones you have the Openbank example, and you look at
Openbank operating in pure 100% digital mortgages, you see that Openbank is doing the same volume of
mortgage equivalent at 200 branches or something like that, yeah. So, this tells you that digitalization produce a
commercial reach that – well, given the granularity of the branches in Spain, the large number of branches, you
can create a different morphology of the branches you have. So, it's not just the number of point of sale, it's the
type of point of sale you have, yeah. So, probably it's less number, more size per branch, yeah.
So, now, José, you want to elaborate on capital?

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Alvaro, some of the inspections that were scheduled for this year following COVID were postponed for next
year. They haven't started yet so we don't know for sure at this point which ones will be closed next year. A
conservative estimate would put the impact well below the regulatory impact that we had in 2020. So, we see –
we continue to see our capital ratio moving at the upper end of the 11% to 12% range over the next 12 months at
least.

How confident are we about the ECB or the SSM allowing to pay dividends? Well, [ph] imagine our case
(00:39:15) yeah, so in our case is what we are telling you right now. So, a strong pre-provision profit that is [ph] on
call (00:39:25), we are not decreasing our pre-provision profit. That give us enough firepower as the first line of
defense in order to offset potential negative outcomes coming from the credit side given the uncertainty of the
scenario. And this is our case. And while not to subordinate bank shareholders to other shareholders of other
sectors or companies asking us to keep their lending going at the cost of potential dividends for the shareholders,
yeah. So, we are making our case. Well, base it on the what we've done since the pandemia started, we
increased the lending, we provide liquidity all across the board, we continue to generate results and, based on
this, we're asking them to allow us to pay dividends. It's 100% up to them to allow us to do or not, yeah.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale
Hello. Thank you very much for the presentation. One question on NII and your outlook for next year, specifically
Spain and the UK. In the UK, in particular, we're seeing some pickup in new pricing and also lower swap costs.
So, do you see a recovery in NII from here or should we take into account the, in Spain, same thing, but on the
opposite the Euribor is putting some pressure on the sector? How do you see NII evolving in 2021? And that's
pretty much it.
Well, maybe a quick question on mortgage formalization costs. We've seen recently a new sentence in a first
instance court but it's kind of going – following a collective lawsuit like a class action against Spanish banks and
they are – there seems to be [indiscernible] (00:41:43) for the sector. Do you see that as a potential risk that could
increase the [ph] post (00:41:48) potential provisioning needs here contrary to the previous jurisprudence where
courts has been ruling on a case-by-case basis? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to elaborate on NII both in UK and Spain. As you've seen in the quarter, positive developments
there [ph] that within (00:42:13) in the UK will be translated in the future. In Spain, will remain also positive, not as
strong as in UK on the back of what you already mentioned, the Euribor is getting more [indiscernible] (00:42:25)
getting more and more into negative territory. But in both case, we think [ph] with different extensions (00:42:32)
that we're going to remain in positive territory going forward.
What you're referring to the mortgages, well, I think you referred to the upfront fee we charge on the mortgages.
That was one case. I don't see this having the capacity to progress on the upper courts and being a case, [ph] a
overall case as the others that we have seen (00:42:55). But well, again, this is a fairly common practice not only
in mortgages, it's also in consumer loans, it's also in lending to corporates, it's everywhere. But, well, I do not
expect this to come an issue for the industry.

Fernando Gil De Santivanes Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to touch a little bit on fees and what is driving the new policy in
Spain about fees and change. What do you expect in the change of fees from November on? This is the first
question. And the second question, you mentioned that the cost restructuring is coming mainly on Spain and the
UK. Are we thinking in the UK some branch reduction only or people or what other message could be done to try
to make a good guess on [ph] what is coming (00:44:10) in the UK? Thank you.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Okay. The new policy, what call new policy in Spain, this is a formulation. What we've done is reformulation of the
current strategy to have more customers [indiscernible] (00:44:34) and this is a step in this direction through – but
the most important is [ph] happening on the back, as you say (00:44:43) we are betting on a significant – not only
in Spain, also across Europe, in a significant simplification of the product range that will allow us to have a more
transparent offer, at the same time to reduce costs in a significant way. We don't expect a big deal in fees out of
this reformulation of our current product mix. It's more simplification of the product range as a result of this
simplification, a significant cost reduction and more transparent relationship with the customer.
And the second question was about the details of cost in the UK. So, in UK, well, we are doing already this. Some
of the cost till now came basically from some significant remediation process that add complexity at the corporate
center [ph] on a quarter level (00:45:43) like the PPIs and other scheme [ph] to an end – (00:45:48) are coming to
an end. At some point, we've got significant number of people, thousands of people working on this and this is
coming to an end and we are reducing costs there.
On top of this, we have a restructuring of the call centers that is going on. This restructuring is through
incorporation of new technology. The number of people working in call centers in the UK is thousands, 4,000 or
5,000. We are introducing new technology and this allow us to simplify and to provide better service to the
customer on the back of the new technology we're including there. The same can be applied to other
[indiscernible] (00:46:29) the number of branches was already [indiscernible] (00:46:30) significantly. It's more
about central services, IT, and the way we serve customers at the corporate – not exactly at the corporate center,
at the different corporate centers' level or centers of services that we have across UK.
And in the case of Spain, nothing to add particularly on this, yeah.

Operator: The next question comes from Sofie Peterzéns from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzéns Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. So, in your presentation, you mentioned that you're combining Openbank
with the Santander Consumer Finance. Does this mean that you're going to start offering mortgages in the
markets that Santander Consumer Finance is currently present in but where Openbank is not? So, for example
Scandinavia, Germany, Italy. And then how should we think about these kind of merger between Openbank and
Santander Consumer Finance? What does it really mean for Santander?
My second question would be around the financial transaction tax that is coming to Spain from January next
year? What impacts, if any, do you expect this to have on Santander? And do you think there is a risk that Spain
could also introduce the banking tax in Spain? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie, for your question. The first question, the combination of Openbank, Consumer Finance. As you
know, Consumer Finance is a large consumer finance platform across Europe with 15 – we are working in 15
countries, all the large countries in Europe. And on the other side, we have a retail bank – full-fledged retail bank
13


Banco Santander SA
(SAN) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
through Openbank. What we try to get out of this combination is – Santander Consumer Finance, we've got 20
million – I should call then – I shouldn't – I cannot call them customers at this stage because they are basically
borrowers that got along from Santander through third-party channels. With this combination, we try to provide a
full offer not only a long – a full offer in the combination with Openbank.
You mentioned specifically mortgages. Mortgages is not at this stage the main task. So, we continue to produce
consumer loans. We're going to develop the point of sale, the checkout lending [ph] and all these things
(00:49:14) at the beginning and having a retail offering to different banks we have across Europe. At the same
time, these banks we have – I don't know exactly the number of bank [indiscernible] (00:49:26) we have in Europe
but we're going to reduce significantly and we're going to operate through a limited number of banks, probably
three is not yet established. And the others will be branches of those banks with the technology of Openbank and
with the capabilities through third-party channels of Consumer Finance. I think this combination is powerful, will
allow us to grow significantly the business and transform many of these I called before borrowers into customers
of the new entity.
You mentioned the financial transaction tax impact on Santander. None or marginal. We're going to pass to the
customers naturally. It's true that the volumes may get reduced and this may affect fees on brokerage but those
are so small that in any case it's immaterial in terms of the P&L. Yeah.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jernej Omahen Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yeah. Good afternoon from my side as well. I just have two questions, please. The first one is the follow-on on the
dividend, and I'd like to understand better or if you could share with us rather how does the process works
currently between a bank like Santander and the SSM, the supervisor? I struggle to imagine that Santander with a
dividend proposal on the AGM and made it public as a consequence without at least telling a very extensive
discussion with the supervisor whether that's appropriate and all. I would like your comment on that.
And then the second question on the process is when are you actually expecting to hear from the SSM on the
decision on the dividend? And just a follow-up, José Antonio, you talked about how Santander made the case to
the SSM for dividend approval and you referenced strong pre-provision profit, increased lending, and generated
results and I think everybody on this call agrees with this. But I guess that the key feature of the SSM then was
that it didn't discriminate amongst banks and it doesn't discriminate amongst banks regardless of their operating
and financial strength. Implied in your answer, I think, is a notion that this will change. So, are you expecting the
SSM to start differentiating amongst banks that can and can't distribute in the future? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Jernej. You asked me how the process work with the SSM. Well, we have our responsibilities and the
SSM has – they have their own responsibilities. And what based – what we've done this morning in our AGM was
based on the current result generation and our expectation for the future, we put for approval at the shareholders
meeting a cash dividend for next year. This is our assessment of the situation, yeah.
14


Banco Santander SA

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
So, what do we expect from the SSM? The SSM is going to do the analysis. On the – what – I don't know if this is
already established, but like what I heard is they're going to have some outcome by December this year, yeah?
So, they're going to say something in December. The recommendation or no recommendation or, as you say,
they are – they may be worried about discriminating between banks. And, well, I'm not in a position to elaborate
about their thinking.
We make our case. We think our case is strong. On the basis of this, we proposed this to the shareholders, yeah?
So, it's what I can tell you at this stage, is no more – no less than we are responsible on behalf of our
shareholders. And also, we need to take naturally of bank holders and the clients and the customers and all of
these things. But the numbers support our claim, and this is what we think and what we expect to be recognized
by the SSM at the appropriate time. And this – my expectation will be by December, yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Also, if I may, just remember that our minimum capital requirement is now 8.5%. So, at 11.5% fully loaded, we
have 300 basis points of capital. And in the worst crisis that we've heard in decades, the bank is generating
capital. So, even before, or even after accruing for the dividend, the capital ratio is going up, we are not leaving
any requests from any client without being attended. So, I think it's – all of these, it's a strong case to allow bank –
Santander to pay dividends going forward.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas SA
Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the presentations and for taking my questions. I have two questions. One
is, what do we expect in terms of recurring revenue growth in LatAm? And you have commented a lot about UK
and Spain. How do you see LatAm in terms of consumer volumes? Have we seen a recovery? So, a bit of outlook
on fees and NII in Brazil, Mexico mainly to be honest.
And the second one, it's on the restructuring charges that are associated to the €1 billion of cost savings. And
then, did you plan sort of like a similar level to the ones that you took in 2019 for the previous €1 billion, around
€600 million, or how do we expect them to happen? And just a very quick one, what is the level of cost of equity
that you have in mind historically the bank has had to an annualize level? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The first question, Ignacio – your question was about revenue growth in LatAm. So, we see – we continue
to see [indiscernible] (00:56:18) local currencies, yeah? So, the exchange rate comes on top of this, yeah? In
local currency, I expect the volume growth to be significant. [ph] Growth (00:56:27) in the numbers in Brazil, our
volume growth is significant. Also, same growth Mexico, although the economic situation going on in Mexico is
significantly worse than it is in Brazil. But positive volume growth will translate in this into higher revenue.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Basically, I do expect some negatives coming from what happened this year with the special check in Brazil
where the regulator, particularly in the payments space, may act in some direction.
So, overall, I'm positive in growing revenues there. But probably we're going to grow much faster revenue – sorry,
volumes than NII on the back of probably some margin compression and regulators stepping in some areas,
particularly related probably with fee income, maybe also with some pricing like they did in Brazil at the beginning
of this year.
Restructuring charge, well, we have – we don't take this for granted. We need to go into a process with –
establish all the negotiation. What I could have in mind is a payback of 1.5 to 1.7, 1.8 years in the restructuring
cost in relation with the cost reduction.
The cost of equity I were referring in our annual report we present every year, and I don't know how it's called [ph]
IRP (00:58:00). I don't know how do you call it. Every year, we publish our cost of equity there. And you take the
last couple of years, if I remember, was – the lowest has been in the 8-something percent and the highest has
been in the 9-something percent, yeah? Yeah. So, this is the range we have had and this is the – take this as a
range to use when we're referring to the cost of equity. Naturally, it's not the case right now, yeah? But now, there
is a significant [ph] reduction (00:58:31) going on at the start of these metrics, yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Adrian Cighi Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Hi there. Thank you very much. Two follow-up questions please. One on the 2021 outlook. You now expect the
underlying RoTE to be in-line with your cost of equity, which you just defined as 8% to 9% range. Current
consensus is expecting an RoTE of less than 6% despite already incorporating a cost of risk of around 130 basis
points, which is in line with your guidance. Can you maybe help us bridge the gap just on broad strokes?
And the second one is on inorganic growth. The Santander Chairman supports consolidation, but remains
reluctant to be a part of it at the moment. What catalyst would be necessary for Santander to be involved in M&A
in Europe or the US? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, in your first question, well, it's – probably you have your expectations. Probably, if the cost of risk is pretty
much the same, probably we – our view about revenues is more optimistic than yours, yeah? So, it's the only way
– on costs. So, we continue to expect cost reductions in Europe. I already mentioned this. I already elaborate on
this.
On the other side, I also elaborate on looking – seeing the NII, both in UK and Spain stay in the positive territory,
and the fee income naturally with all the caveats about the uncertainty related with the COVID being also positive.
So, we expect positive revenue, cost-cutting negative nominal costs, and this should translate into a relatively or
healthy P&L compared with the one-off this year, yeah? So, this is my view at this stage.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
When you're referring to an organic growth, well, M&A in US and Europe, okay, so we've been reluctant because
this stage, we struggle to relay equity story that works, yeah? So, in which we are able to secure properly in the
middle of this scenario. Now, we are concentrated in margin, what we have in front of us. And we don't need to
get too complicated in our – and to devote our management capabilities to other things and the ones we are
currently managing. And this is the main reason, yeah? So, not other than this one. And because traditionally, we
did plenty of inorganic growth on the back of getting the scale, yeah?
And, well, we already got the scale in the majority of the markets, almost all the markets in which we are in. And,
well, when people ask me, why not go in Spain with 20% – or around 20% market share, I don't need to scale.
And this happens in the majority of the markets in which we're working, and we are much more focused in the
internal transformation with the projects we mentioned and the Chairman mentioned in the year-end, the One
Europe project, the combination of Consumer Finance and Openbank, and finally to build the payment platforms
across the group, both for acquiring business and SME trade regulated business, yeah? So, this is the main focus
. We're going to work on this on top of managing the current business in a highly uncertain environment that
require all our attention, yeah?

Stefan R. Nedialkov Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to probe a little bit, the 2021 guidance. So, when the pandemic started
back in March, you came up with some guidance in terms of expected impact for 2020. And in retrospect, that
ended up being quite optimistic. Obviously, it's been very uncertain times. But what makes you more confident
this time around in giving 2021 guidance, which is substantially above consensus as Adrian noted?
And related to that, when we looked at your Stage 2 break down for loans that are under moratoria versus those
that are not, it looks like the Stage 2 ratio was around 16% versus 6% for the group as a total. Can you just give
us some color on how you're thinking about the potential transition from Stage 2 into Stage 3 of the moratoria
along next year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The first question is a very fair one given the uncertainty of the macro scenario in which we are living. So,
at the beginning of this pandemia, nobody was expecting what has already happened, maybe what is still in front
of us. But what make us – but with you asking us about guidance, we gave out you first any scenario that this next
are very much in line with how you [ph] manage a (01:04:20) scenario.
And second, we already seen the reaction of the different actors in this crisis. We saw the reaction of the central
banks. The central bank reacted. In some cases, reducing – flushing dramatically rates in US, in UK, in Brazil as
in other markets, and this has an impact. At the same time, they provide liquidity. They provide their TLTRO III.
And we saw the reaction of the central banks stabilizing the markets, and they're going to continue to do so based
on what they are telling us on a – almost on a daily basis. So this is one side.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
On the other side, the governments are stepping in two directions. One direction was to provide warrantees for
lending to the SMEs and corporates. For example – in some countries, this is very important. In Spain, we got –
we grew lending and we've got €27 billion of warrantees for the SMEs and corporate book. Now, €27 billion is
warranted by the government, and the government showed its willingness to continue to support economic activity
with new lines for investments. So, this is – we already know this, we didn't know it before.
And looking forward, my expectation and it's only my expectation is [indiscernible] (01:05:48), I do expect based
that once the pandemia – let's call it comes to an end, and coming to an end means that we have an effective
treatment or a [ph] vaccine (01:06:01) or a combination of both, I do expect the governments to keep these
schemes going for a while till the economy start to recover. We may be wrong naturally on this. I mentioned a
couple of times, uncertainty. Uncertainty is the word probably I repeat the most in this scenario, but we tell you
our views. And based on what views, we are building our impressions about the future and the trends about the
future.
When you mentioned the Stage 2 and Stage 3, well, let me to remember on the moratoria, we have kind of two –
behind the moratoria, we have kind of two different type of customers. The ones who are taking a financial
advantage because in some moratoria, they [indiscernible] (01:06:56) financial advantage for the customer and
some customers took it. So, this means that it costs us money in our P&L because we are, in some cases,
lending money for free. They took this. Some of our customers that they took because they fear about the future
or they worry about the situation.
Having more than two-thirds of the moratoria expired and I show you the behavior, and the remaining moratoria is
still there. The majority is secure lending. Keep in mind that, for example, in Spain, people in mortgages, it's
much, much cheaper to pay the mortgage than to rent a house, yeah? So – but it's not 30% cheaper. Maybe 60%
cheaper or 70% cheaper. So, I do not expect a significant deterioration on mortgages.
And as you show in the presentation, the overwhelming majority of the moratoria stays in mortgages. Naturally,
we are having significant rating migration in our portfolio when we analyze this. And as a result of this, risk-
weighted taxes grew in the region of €7 billion, €8 billion. That means that probably we are downgrading €30
billion, €40 billion of the loan book to different ratings, probably in the corporate, large corporate sector. And this is
going from one stage to another.
And this is a process that will continue based on our future expectations. But I'm not at this stage particularly
worried about moratoria. Maybe I need to make a caveat in SC USA. What I mentioned at the beginning, I think it
was in the first or second question one of your colleagues make, that the behavior in SC USA in the auto market
in US is extremely good, much better than the one we were expecting, particularly on the back of the price of
used cars in the US that currently is still – is 15% above of the prices of last year. And this reduced dramatically
the loss given the fall in this business. And I don't know, to be honest with you, how long it will last this. For this
year, our projection is more or less optimistic than the current situation. But it is what it is. But there are naturally
significant levels of uncertainty around all our forecasting, particularly on the cost of risk front, yeah?
Also, maybe that while we may face more severe pandemia and we have another lockdown like the ones we had
back in the spring that we are not forecasting. We are – somehow if you allow me to say, we are forecasting kind
of current situation till the spring and having some remedies after that, yeah? So, there may be treatment, [ph]
vaccine (01:09:49), or less incidents of the COVID. But I agree with you that, what, we are in uncharted territory,
yeah? And I'm not particularly well-equipped to forecast a health issues, yeah?
