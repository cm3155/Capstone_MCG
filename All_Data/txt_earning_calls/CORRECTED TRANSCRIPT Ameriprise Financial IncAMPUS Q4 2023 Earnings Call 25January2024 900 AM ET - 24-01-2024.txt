Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me
today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you see a discussion
of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial
measures, which we believe provide insight into company operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to
their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on the call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of

today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2023
earnings release, our 2022 Annual Report to shareholders and our 2022 10-K report. We make no obligation to
publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you see
adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting
the underlying performance of our core operations, and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James M. Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. I hope that 2024 started off well for each of you. As you saw in our earnings release,
Ameriprise delivered a strong fourth quarter to complete an excellent year. I'm proud of our team and what we've
accomplished. We've navigated the environmental uncertainty well, supported our clients, and further
demonstrated the strength of our value propositions.
Regarding the operating environment, what was more positive to end 2023 and start the new year, we know there
are questions regarding the continuation of economic growth, inflation and the timing of interest rate reductions.
Of course, markets are unpredictable. However, at Ameriprise, our expertise is preparing both our clients and the
business to be successful even in an uncertain climate.
Now with that backdrop, let's move to our results. For the quarter, revenue growth continued to be robust, up 8%,
reflecting good organic growth and positive markets. We again generated strong earnings growth with EPS up
10%, or 14% normalized for the items referenced in our press release. And our nearly 50% ROE is consistently
among the best in the industry.
We also delivered excellent full-year adjusted operating results. Excluding unlocking and the items we referenced,
revenue was $15.4 billion, up 8%. Earnings increased 18% to $3.3 billion. And our EPS was $30.46, up another
24%. In fact, these are record results for Ameriprise, and assets under management and administration were near
an all-time high at $1.4 trillion. Across the firm, we're very well-positioned to help investors with our compelling
client experience and complement the businesses, capabilities and talented team.
With regard to some business highlights, Wealth Management delivered another strong quarter. Our efforts are
centered on engaging more people in our advice-based client experience, which helps our clients achieve more of
their goals and creates higher satisfaction, net flows and productivity growth.
Client acquisition was up nicely in the quarter, especially in the $500,000 to $5 million client segment. Total client
assets increased to a new record of $901 billion, up 19%, and client flows were approximately $23 billion.
Total transactional activity picked up a bit in the quarter. However, given the environment, clients continued to
maintain higher cash levels with assets and cash products growing to about $82 billion. Over time, we expect
these assets will be further deployed as clients return to the markets more fully.
Year-after-year, our advisor productivity growth is consistently among the best in the industry. In fact, it increased
another 11% to a new high of $916,000 per advisor in the quarter. Our field force is highly engaged, and they

value the Ameriprise culture as to the experienced advisors we recruit. In the quarter, we brought on board 166
productive advisors, which includes the Comerica advisors who joined us. Recruits tell us that associating with
Ameriprise has given them a strong client value proposition, integrated technology and the leadership support
they need to provide first-class service to their clients and grow their practices.
Our bank continues to provide benefits and grow nicely. Bank and certificate assets increased 28% to $37 billion.
We see good opportunity here to further deepen client relationships and bring in more of our client assets that
they hold at other banking institutions.
As you can see, our consistent focus and investment in the business is driving strong results. And we're not
standing still. We continue to invest significantly to drive further efficiency and organic growth. Advisors using our
integrated eMeeting capability, customer relationship platform and online advisor dashboards find that these tools
enhance their ability to deliver for clients and manage their practices, as well as identify growth opportunities.
We're also leveraging advanced analytics and accelerating enhancements to our mobile and digital experiences
on our public and secure sites to engage more clients and prospects.
I'd also highlight that Ameriprise brand awareness is strong and steady, and our growth opportunity continues to
be significant. Clients and prospects across segments need meaningful contact and advice more than ever, and
that's where we're concentrating. Earlier this month, I met with our field leaders to kick off the year. They're highly
engaged and energized about our position and ability to build on our success in 2024.
Next, in Retirement & Protection, we're driving good sales. These solutions help serve our clients comprehensive
needs and the business is consistently a strong earnings contributor. The team is focused on providing a best-in-
class experience with an ease of doing business and it's resulting in better sales.
Total variable annuity sales were up 15%, with good sales in our structured product. Protection sales were up 6%,
driven by our higher-margin VUL product. In addition, we just introduced new enhancements to our core product
lines to help further serve our clients' evolving protection and income needs.
Moving to Asset Management. We continue to serve clients in an evolving market. Assets under management
grew nicely in the fourth quarter, up 9% to $637 billion driven by market appreciation and positive foreign
exchange.
In terms of some color on flows. Our US retail mutual fund outflows were in line with the industry. Though they
remained pressured, we had a bit of a pickup in gross sales and redemptions have slowed from a year ago. UK
retail remained soft, and we're seeing some improvements in Europe. For global institutional, our outflows were
elevated as we expected due to the actions we set to realign resources, including portfolio management changes.
Our product capabilities are extensive and the team is concentrating on regaining sales momentum. Performance
is critical to that, and we're delivering consistent competitive investment performance that reflects our research
expertise. Our 3, 5 and 10 year numbers are very strong, and we saw a nice pickup in the one year fixed income
numbers.
And I highlight that we continue to have 113 4- and 5-star Morningstar rated funds in our lineup. Like other active
managers, we're managing industry pressure and doing a great deal to refine our operating processes while
reducing expenses globally. We're enhancing our efficiency and effectiveness while making good investments,
including in data and analytics. We're focused on leveraging our performance as well as our global distribution
and servicing capabilities.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
So, for Ameriprise, it was another great year and a continuation of our significant growth over many years. In
addition, we built on our record of strong financial performance, including generating one of the best ROEs in the
industry. And with that, we consistently demonstrate our ability to return to shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, Ameriprise returned another $587 million, and for the full year, we returned $2.5 billion to
shareholders. Over the last five years, we returned a substantial amount to shareholders that resulted in a share
count reduction of 25%. As I look at Ameriprise, we continue to be well positioned. The strong performance we
achieved is underscored by the industry accolades Ameriprise consistently earns.
Over the course of the year, this is the type of recognition we received. 4.9 out of 5 stars in client satisfaction from
our clients. Our employee and advisor engagement ranks among the best across all industries. We have one of
the highest customer trust scores in financial services. J.D. Power has awarded us for Outstanding Customer
Service Experience for our advisor phone support five years in a row.
Ameriprise is the winner in the Wealth Management category from Kiplinger's. In addition, we've been recognized
as a military-friendly employer nine years in a row and as a best place to work for disability inclusion.
Finally, Ameriprise is among the Best Managed Companies of 2023 on The Wall Street Journal Management Top
250 list. For the firm overall, as we enter a 130 year in the business, our foundation and business are strong. I'm
immensely proud of our people, and we have a great opportunity to continue our success together in 2024.
Now, I'll turn things over to Walter, and then we'll take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. As Jim said, strong results this quarter continued to demonstrate the leverage of our diversified
business model across market cycles.
Underlying EPS grew 14% to $7.75 after adjusting for items in the quarter that we called out in the release. These
included $0.28 of expense related to a regulatory accrual, $0.14 from severance expense, and elevated mark-to-
market impacts on share-based compensation expense of $0.13 resulting from Ameriprise's substantial share
price appreciation. You would not have been aware of these items and their associated magnitude.
Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, up 15%, benefiting from $36
billion of client flows in 2023 and market appreciation. Across the firm, we continued to manage expenses tightly
relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment.
G&A increased only 2% normalized to the items I noted. We continued to take a disciplined approach on
discretionary expenses across the firm to manage margins given the uncertainty in the macro environment as
evidenced by the $26 million of severance recognized in the third and fourth quarters.
At the same time, we continued to make investments to drive business growth, particularly in Wealth
Management. As we move into 2024, we will continue the same discipline and we'll maintain a flat expense base
for the year at a minimum.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Our consolidated margin was 26.4% excluding the items I noted. And we have a best-in-class return on equity of
48.5%. The balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital and liquidity positions remain strong
and we've seen a significant $1.8 billion reduction in the net unrealized loss position to only $1.5 billion.
Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable 90% free cash flow contributions across all
business segments. This allowed us to return $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the year, a continuation of
our differentiated track record.
Lastly, I mentioned that Ameriprise successfully expanded its presence in the financial institutions channel. The
closing on our partnership with Comerica Bank in November that added an initial $15 billion of client flows. Given
the timing of the conversion, there was limited financial benefit in the quarter.
On slide 6, you'll see our strong results in 2023 were driven by business momentum across key measures. Assets
grew 15%, with revenues up 8%, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 10%; and the pre-tax adjusted
operating margin was 26.4%. The diversified nature of our businesses strengthens our model and drives our
consistent performance. It is this balance that enables Ameriprise to consistently drive shareholder value across
market cycles.
The key growth driver of Ameriprise is the Wealth Management business, as you can see on slide 7. Wealth
Management client assets increased 19% year-over-year to $901 billion, driven by strong organic growth and
client flows, along with higher equity markets.
We had $53 billion of net inflows over the past year, with $23 billion coming in the quarter from new clients joining
the firm, the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisors. Revenue per advisor reached
$916,000 in the quarter, up 11% from the prior year, from higher spread revenue, enhanced productivity and
business growth.
On slide 8, you can see how the business performance drove strong financial results for Wealth Management. In
the quarter, adjusted operating net revenues increased 8% to $2.4 billion from growth in client assets in both wrap
and brokerage accounts and improved transactional activity. This included about $15 billion of initial flows related
to Comerica partnership, in addition to the $8 billion of underlying client flows.
While markets were favorable in the quarter, we did not realize the full benefit of the market appreciation in the
quarter given our beginning-of-month billing practice. We are starting the year with the wind at our backs with the
significant market appreciation to end the year.
Total cash balance, including third-party money market funds and brokered CDs reached a new high this quarter
at $81.5 billion. We are seeing stability in our underlying client cash positions with sweep cash up 4%
sequentially. This stabilization has continued into January. Additionally, we continue to see new money flowing
into money market funds and brokered CDs as well as into our certificates. This creates significant redeployment
opportunities as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our
platform over time.
The financial benefits from cash remain significant and will be a sustainable source of earnings going forward.
Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased 9%, with distribution expense up 10%, reflecting higher
asset balances. Excluding the regulatory accrual, G&A declined 1% in the quarter and was up only 4% for the full
year. We will continue to invest in this growing business while maintaining this expense discipline in 2024.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
In total, the underlying margin expanded 40 basis points to 30.3%, reflecting our revenue growth combined with
expense discipline. This level is consistent with our margin for the full year.
Turning to Asset Management on slide 9. Financial results were very strong in the quarter, and we are managing
the business well through a challenging environment for active asset managers.
Total AUM increased 9% to $637 billion, primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation,
partially offset by net outflows. Like other active managers, we experienced pressure on retail flows from global
market volatility and a risk-off investor sentiment.
In addition, we had $3 billion of institutional outflows that included $2 billion of expected breakage from portfolio
management changes made as part of our reengineering initiatives.
Investment performance is another critical area of focus and long-term 3-, 5- and 10-year investment performance
remains strong. We also had notable improvements in one-year fixed income performance in the quarter from
strength in mortgage opportunities, tax exempts and strategic municipal income strategies.
In the quarter, operating earnings increased $194 million as a result of equity market appreciation, disciplined
expense management and higher performance fees, which more than offset the cumulative impact of net
outflows.
Performance fees are an important part of our business and reflect excellent performance in our hedge fund and
other institutional accounts, but the recognition of performance fees is uneven throughout the year. While we had
$30 million in performance fees in both 2023 and 2022, the fourth quarter this year included $21 million in
performance fees and the fourth quarter of 2022 only included $5 million.
We are finalizing the integration of BMO and are looking globally at areas where we can to enhance operational
efficiency and manage expenses so we are well-positioned going forward.
G&A was down 4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation and performance fee compensation.
And the margin was in our target range of 32% in the quarter. Looking ahead, as Jim said, we will continue to take
further expense action in 2024, given the environment to preserve margin in our target range.
Let's turn to slide 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow
generation, reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time. Pre-tax
adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased 2% to $202 million, reflecting higher investment yields.
Overall, Retirement & Protection Solutions sales improved in the quarter, with protection sales up 6% to $72
million, primarily in higher-margin VUL products. Variable annuity sales grew 15% to $1.1 billion, with the majority
of sales in structured variable annuities.
Turning to slide 11. Ameriprise delivered excellent growth in 2023 and has done the same over the longer term
and through changing market cycles, reflecting our focus on profitable growth.
In 2023, revenues grew 8% from higher interest earnings, higher equity markets and solid client net inflows.
Earnings per share increased 21% from last year from revenue trends, well-managed expenses and differentiated
capital return. And ROE increased 290 basis points to nearly 49%.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Over the past five years, we have generated 6% revenue and 15% EPS compounded annual growth, and 1,170
basis points of improvement in ROE. This is differentiated performance across multiple cycles compared to our
peers and speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix and the growth of our Wealth Management
business.
Turning to slide 12, you can see Wealth Management was a significant contributor to Ameriprise's successful
performance, driving two-thirds of the company's operating earnings. Our advisors are becoming more productive
with the support of our advice model, with revenue per advisor of $916,000 in the year, up 8% on an annualized
basis from 2018. And we are growing profitably with 16% growth in pre-tax earnings since 2018. And over that
timeframe, our Wealth Management margin has expanded 840 basis points to nearly 31%, putting it at industry-
leading levels.
Now let's finish with the balance sheet on slide 13. Our solid balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow
generations have supported our ability to execute a consistent capital return strategy, while continuing to invest
for growth.
In 2023, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, with $587 million in the fourth quarter. But over the past five
years, we returned $12 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. This included the
repurchase of 41 million shares at an average price of $215, resulting in a net reduction in our share count of
25%. Looking ahead, capital management will continue to be a point of differentiation for Ameriprise.
With that, we will take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first
question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start with the bank. So we've got $3 billion, I believe
you've indicated that there's expectation for $3 billion of maturities expected in 2024. Can you give a sense, given
where rates are in the market today, what kind of yield pickup you're likely to see on those balances? And
whether or not you have visibility into what those maturities might be in 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. In 2025, we anticipate it will still be $25 billion. Again, these are payoffs and from that standpoint. And when
we look at it, let me answer the question this way. From a net interest income standpoint, when we evaluate
looking at various scenarios and using the forward curves, the generation in 2024 and 2025 will be higher than
that in 2023 because again, the rates we have been adding at are very – at rates close to 6%. And that runoff will
be basically coming through and our reinvestments, the differentials, will still allow us to have a higher net interest
income in 2024 and 2025. But it's $3 billion in both years.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
$3 billion. Okay. Thank you very much. And then one sort of mechanical question. So, quarter-over-quarter, off-
balance sheet broker-dealer yield compressed pretty substantially. But it's my understanding that that's tied to the
$2.5 billion of cash sweep tied to Comerica. So is that right? And was that due to like some kind of promotional or
temporary crediting rate? And when is that expected to roll off and normalize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So if we're talking about now the off balance sheet rate on a sequential basis, is that what you're referring to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes, exactly. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So that – yes, we did take on a $2.5 billion down for Comerica, and that will transition through over the next six
months. And certainly that will work towards the rate increasing. But our base rate has basically stayed the same
ex-Comerica. There's been no change.

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. First, I just wanted to follow-up on the comment on net interest income. In terms of
2024 and 2025 expecting to be higher than 2023, what did you – can you give us any sense of what you assumed
in terms of the forward rates when you made that comment? Was that using the forward curve, or any more color
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We are using the forward curve in that, and we run sensitivity. But what my statement was referring to was the
forward curve as – the latest forward curve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the size of the bank. Can you give any color on kind of expectations for
potentially moving some of the cash sweep balance into the bank and how – what you think the bank asset size
could grow to over the course of 2024?

Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So right now, we are seeing stability and really little growth in our sweep accounts. So we feel very
comfortable about it. And we still have buffer there. So we are evaluating that, but we'll be more measured as we
go forward because we've certainly placed and shifted a lot of substantial amount. But you would see that it will
be increasing but at a slower pace as we evaluate these sweep balances that support that. So I would say that it
will be increasing but at a slower pace.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. How are you? Thanks. So I wanted to ask you guys a question around a substantial amount of cash that you
guys have on the sidelines. I think it was north of $30 billion. And I know you sort of talked about some of that
coming into some of the investment products. But as you sort of think about what are the likely areas where this
capital could go into with respect to wrap accounts or something else, how would you frame that? And maybe talk
through some of the revenue lift that you could get from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Are you talking about where our cash sits today on...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So not stuff that's in the sweep, right? But there's been other capital that I think essentially earning you guys not a
whole lot, whether it's the CDs or money market funds. Kind of where those balances are and where that could
shift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So those balances are in money markets and brokerage CDs short-term that will roll off. And so as they do,
I think advisors will evaluate whether they put that back into the market. And if they did, I would probably say a
10


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
portion of that would go back, a reasonable portion, will go back most likely into wrap type programs, in balanced
type portfolios, which would include both equities and fixed income, et cetera, alternatives.
On the other side of it, there, we've seen a bit of a pickup in some transactional activity as well in the fourth
quarter. So, some of that will go back into transactional type activities as they look at longer duration type
products as well. So again, that's really as advisors look at the market and they put money to work over time for
their clients.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I got you. Thanks. And then my second question was just around operating leverage for the firm and obviously
encouraging to hear your comments around G&A outlook. If you roll that through, it seems like the margin in the
asset management business could be materially higher than sort of your longer-term ranges. Obviously, not a
terrible thing. But as you sort of think about those historical targets, are they still something you try to manage the
business to? Or it's really just kind of more of the output because the fees are obviously off to a very good start in
2024 and expenses are going to be very tightly managed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So obviously, we've been very proactive in managing the controllable aspect of that on the expenses, not
just in AWM, even in AM, but across the board. So yes, obviously, it will be dependent on several factors as it
relates to markets or other things as it relates to margin. But with – right, I'm not going to forecast exactly where it
goes, but I think we feel comfortable that we have put in place our control of G&A at Asset Management and that
we have the capability with the right set of conditions sets going on with markets. And certainly, if we – as we get
– make progress on our flows, that is – certainly can increase. But right now, we're comfortable with the current
levels that we have, but we have the potential.

Hey. Good morning. So wanted to start off with just a question on the AWM margin. Just given some of your
larger wirehouse peers have guided to lower wealth margins for the next few quarters, given the absence of NII
tailwinds, incremental investments to sustain organic growth. You noted, Walter, that your spread revenues will be
more resilient in 2024. But do you believe you can sustain that north of 30% pre-tax margin in AWM even in the
face of rate cuts in line with the forward curve?

Yes. I think that we have reasonable confidence that we will be able to sustain. But obviously, there are variables
that go into that. But as I indicated, our net interest income was – 2024, will certainly be higher than 2023. So yes,
I think we have a reasonable level of confidence in that.

So yes, we came in at 79%, I would agree with you, for the year. And right now, we – our capacity and capability
certainly remains very strong, as you can see from the balance sheet elements and certainly our generation. So I
would think that a continuation of that strategy is probably a reasonable expectation.

question.

Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Just wanted to start with the Asset Management business and the expense reductions that you're
doing there. Clearly, you're trying to defend your margin, which I understand. But it feels like we're starting to see
potentially some commercial impacts there. I think you alluded to some outflows related to head count reduction.
So I guess, my question is, how are you thinking about sort of trying to balance that, right, where you're cutting
expenses but at the same time potentially seeing some negative commercial impacts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, from that – what you saw from basically the breakage that we took, it wasn't basically a proactive evaluation
of the payback that we were getting. So that was a conscious decision on our part. Our expense plan has been
basically evaluated on the basis of looking at March, but looking at process and how we can improve efficiency.
So we feel very good about.
There is some basically spillover effects as you get to managing that ultimate return, and some we will get
breakage. We believe the breakage, certainly, what we saw this year, there'll be some but manageable – taking
place in 2024, but manageable. But again, it's a conscious decision on our part, and we feel we give them
opportunities to certainly redeploy the money in other products that we have. So it's – again, it's – we are
controlling what we can and we – which is on the G&A expense, and it's through a conscious review of expense
management.

Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just to level set on that $82 billion cash number that you talked about. I mean, if I think
about that relative to total client assets, it seems like it's upwards around 8%, 9%, which is almost 2x, I think what
you guys normally would expect. Is that the right way to think about it? And then over time, as rates kind of
normalize that kind of 8% to 9% cash balance would probably trickle back down to somewhere in that 4% to 5%
range and that's really the opportunity set that's in front of you in that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Suneet. So it is sort of like double the amount that clients are holding usually compared to where they used
to be. And again, advisors look at it with their clients and they're getting a 5%-plus yield on it, just to sit tight with –
unclear about the market moves, et cetera. So I do believe that over time, that money will be redeployed, but
holding at higher rates right now, it's not an uncomfortable thing for clients and our advisors to keep extra cash
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And is there any reason why that money wouldn't come to Ameriprise? I mean, it sounds like it's in products
outside of your firm, but obviously, your advisors do holistic financial planning. So is there any reason why, either
from a diversification perspective or anything, why that money might want to stay outside of Ameriprise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. In fact, the money is at Ameriprise. The advisors have just put it into whether money market or brokered CDs,
where there was a bigger lineup of brokered CDs before we had our bank and CDs that we'll be launching. So I
think it's a very – but they – just as they did that, they put it into our own certificate program as well, and that grew
nicely. It's up to $13 billion in total.
So I think it was just the outlets for where to park the cash. I think as we put more bank products in, as we
develop the bank, some of that will go into our bank products. We think also there's an opportunity for us to
capture more cash from our clients holding it at their banking institutions, so. But the money that's currently, that
$81 billion is at Ameriprise. And as that rolls over or opportunity the advisors see to rebalance accounts, they'll put
that money to work.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Good morning. First question, just on the layoffs in Asset Management, I think it was 12 PMs. Can you comment
on the size of the AUM that they were managing, and what exactly happened there? Did you merge or close any
funds? Did you replace them? Just a little more color there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, with the breakage, it was basically on that one we closed upon. And obviously, we've looked for alternatives
and was institutional.
And then the other funds, we feel there are opportunities where we can basically merge them into other products
that we have and to get the efficiencies and effect on that. So it's – it was a capital review of it, and we just felt,
based on payback, it would make sense to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And Walter, the total AUM related to the layoffs, are you able to provide that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Right now, where we – the – of the $2 billion was basically the – that was the amount in that fund pretty much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. But of the – I think it was 12 PMs that were let go, are you able to size that in the entirety?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I would have to get back to you exactly on the 12, but I think the majority of it is still related back to the breakage
that we see – we saw. But let me get back to you on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thanks. The redeployment out of Corporate into the segments, I think it's around $15 million. Can
you explain what happened there? And was it all NII, or what happened on that reallocation of the segments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So what we have, obviously, are intercompany cash transferring that goes between the segments. And we
evaluated AWM that the crediting rate that we were giving that was not really, I would say, [indiscernible]
(00:40:49) and market-driven, and so we adjusted it based upon the condition sets that we saw today. And that
will be something that will remain in AWM's profitability going forward based – as long as the levels stay where
they are.
The second one was really an element of relating to – we looked at our models as it relates to RPS, and it was –
candidly, it was not the right rate. We were just not crediting them with the right amount, as simple as that. And
yes, it's in all net interest income, and it has no effect on the company that shifts the money.

Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Just a reallocation among segments, that makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And then just final follow-up. This 90% sustainable free cash flow conversion, you returned 80% in 2023. Do you
plan on stepping that back up to 90% in 2024? Or should we expect it to remain closer to 80%? Do you have an
idea of where you would expect...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, as we said, business opportunistic, we have the capacity, we certainly, as you see, we generate a lot of free
cash flow, and we evaluate that as looking at the opportunities we are continuing to invest in our business. So
that's not a constraining factor. So I would say right now, it's a reasonable estimate to just assume the level that
we just had, and then we will adjust to be opportunistic about it.

Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the expense management initiatives. Are there –
wonder if you could just further flesh it out, looking for any other areas outside of Asset Management. And
perhaps wondering if you could just give a little bit in terms of timeframes, are these actions all to be completed
within this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So what you saw with the $26 million severance and certainly our plans, that these are all actionable and,
certainly, from our standpoint, have already been put into play. And so we are – you should see the benefit of that
materializing as we relayed. We're basically looking at our expenses for 2024, will be flat at a minimum. And
obviously, we continue to make substantial investments in the various businesses, especially in AWM. So it's –
we have pretty high confidence on this.

Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe in your opening remarks, you had mentioned you were
seeing a stabilization of cash levels through January. I was just curious if you had any more color year-to-date on
that. I would have expected more redeployments just from seasonality, rebalancing and distributions and the like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
In the sweep accounts, and this is as of two days ago, we have seen a complete stabilization from that
standpoint, a little increase. So we're obviously observing, we understand the seasonality of it. But certainly, it's
what I indicated, and that's through two days ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Awesome. And then my other question had to do with Retirement and Protection. You guys had a pretty sizable
pickup in the yield for your net investment income. I was curious if you could give us an update on any color on
the investment profile of that book. Just trying to get a better idea of sensitivity to rates there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No, that's invested out now. We took advantage of the rate situation as we saw. So that is pretty much completed
at this view. And also, as I indicated, it will get to pick up going forward of certainly the intercompany cash.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. In this PM reduction in Asset Management, it clearly followed a
thorough review. In that review, were there areas of growth identified? Are you looking to get larger in any specific
products that maybe have come to surface out of that PM review?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So what we did is we had some teams that we felt they're managing small levels of assets, and it wasn't
economical for us in those areas. But we have good teams that could have assumed those assets and had good
performance. So we made adjustments there.
But in so doing, yes, we have reviewed our overall front office and all of the products and the portfolios and the
capabilities that we have on the investment side. We feel there's a good opportunity. We always have that in the
equity part of the arena. But we feel really that we do have a good fixed income and credit shop and that we think
there's opportunity for us to actually get a greater fair share there as we continue to look at what the environment
is. And so – but we've evaluated that both domestically and internationally. And we're picking our pockets of
where we really want to double down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question is around the risk transfers and the comment about the bid
and ask. You've seen the market change a little bit to include third-party sidecars. Would that be an area of
interest?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, we've looked at it, and candidly for us, probably not because of the – most people enter into that for growth
purposes, and we have a fairly large share. So probably not. It's not – but we continue to look.

Q
Excellent. Thank you. And as a follow-up, somewhat related, can you tell us a little bit more about what tech
initiatives you have in place at the moment for advisors in terms of what you're doing to help the Ameriprise
platform stand out and differentiate itself in the marketplace, and particularly what you have coming over the next,
say, 12 to 24 months in terms of the tech pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We feel unbelievably good about our total platform for the advisors, from our combination of CRM platform,
which is the latest and the greatest of all the capabilities with all the integrated technology and data that they can
use on their client portfolios and engagement, to our e-meeting capabilities that actually help them actually put
together their actual proposals for clients and the engagement of meeting with them regarding their needs.
Two, even our AI capabilities, helping them identify opportunities in their book. So we feel really good about the
suite of capabilities that we have, but those capabilities are all integrated, which makes the advisor much easier
with their dashboards to engage their clients to manage their books and to have that deeper engagement with
them through the advice planning models.
So we feel really good and we're continuing to invest heavily. And that's complemented by all the mobile and the
web capabilities that we have for them to do business. So we feel that we have a state-of-the-art type of system,
our availability is very strong. And so we feel it is a differentiating point for us.
