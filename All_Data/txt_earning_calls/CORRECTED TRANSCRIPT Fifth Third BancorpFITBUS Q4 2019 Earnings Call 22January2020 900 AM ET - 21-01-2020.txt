Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported record full year 2019 net
income of $2.5 billion or $3.33 per share. Full year adjusted net income of $2.1 billion was also a record for the
bank.
As I reflect on the past year, I am very pleased with the significant progress we made, to position Fifth Third for
long-term success. In addition to the record net income, we generated our best full year core return on tangible
common equity excluding AOCI in over a decade, up 120 basis points from last year. We produced our lowest
efficiency ratio in over a decade, which decreased 160 basis points from last year. We generated peer-leading
household and deposit growth, all while reducing deposit cost during the year.
Also during the year, we successfully integrated MB Financial. We added significant scale in the Chicago market
and expect to generate even stronger deposit, household and revenue growth going forward. We successfully
navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year 2019 core net interest margin expanded 5 basis
points after expanding 18 basis points the year before which is at the higher end of our peer group.
We generated record fee income, including corporate banking as our capital markets business generated double-
digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year. We also generated record revenue in Wealth & Asset
Management, while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year.
Net charge-off and other key credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels throughout the year. We
generated nearly $0.5 billion of excess capital through Worldpay transactions in 2019 which is yet to be deployed
and we returned over 110% of adjusted earnings to shareholders in 2019 through a 27% increase in our dividend
and through share repurchases. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and
expect to build on our strong performance in 2020 and beyond.
For the fourth quarter, net income available to common shareholders was $701 million or $0.96 per share.
Reported results included a positive $0.28, primarily from the successful Worldpay tax receivable agreement
transaction completed during the quarter. Since the spin-off of our processing business 10 years ago, we have
generated over $7 billion in pre-tax value for our shareholder with another $195 million remaining in TRA income
which we fully realized over the next five years. Tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter TRA transaction in more
detail.
Our fourth quarter financial results were very strong, reflecting our prior North Star Investments to further diversify
our revenue streams, improve balance sheet management, continued expense discipline and our success in
achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the MB Financial acquisition.
We've generated very strong fee revenue, including a new record in capital markets. Our net interest income
results, once again, reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate
environment which led to strong NIM performance in the quarter.
We continue to manage our expenses diligently. This reflects our continued focus on generating efficiencies
throughout the bank while still investing in high-priority areas to support revenue growth. We remain on track to
achieve the $255 million in annual savings from the MB acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and are
excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance, reflecting the generally subdued
macroeconomic environment. Total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up 1% sequentially.
Following our trend, we successfully generated strong core deposit growth while proactively reducing deposit
costs more than our previous guidance. Our average loan to core deposit ratio of 90% is the lowest in over 15
years.
Credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter. Excluding this
impact, net charge-offs were up just 1 basis points sequentially with consumer flat and commercial up 2 basis
points. Provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans.
Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our results and outlook, I would like to once again emphasize our
strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate long-term shareholder value. As I mentioned, we
have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout 2019 and have delivered on our targeted
outcomes as expected.
We will continue to focus on these priorities going forward, including leveraging technology to accelerate our
digital transformation; investing in talent, capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth
and improve profitability; continue to expand our presence in select geographies focusing on high-growth
markets. We are investing in the southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends, higher expected population
growth and greater market vitality. And, lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout
the company.
To that end, our capital allocation priorities are: Organic balance sheet growth, fee-generating non-bank
acquisitions, paying a strong dividend and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions are not a priority. Our medium-
term CET1 capital target remains at approximately 9.5%. We plan to increase our dividend another $0.03 this
quarter subject to board approval. We expect to execute our remaining buybacks from CCAR 2019.
Our clearly defined strategic growth priorities, our proactive balance sheet management and our ongoing
discipline throughout the bank position us well for the future. We continue to focus on striking the appropriate
balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year, while continuing to invest for long-term
performance.
I'm pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. Our strong performance this
quarter was a direct result of our employees' hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of
everything we do.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.

Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide
4 of the earnings presentation. We are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong
year.
Similar to the trends all year, during the fourth quarter, our net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest
income and noninterest expenses all performed in-line or better than our October guidance.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by $0.28 per share from several notable items. The
most significant was a $265 million after-tax gain from the Worldpay TRA transaction, which added approximately
20 basis points to our CET1 ratio.
Similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past 10 years, the TRA
transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that [were] previously
expected to occur primarily from 2025 until 2035.
Consequently, we are also no longer exposed to FIS's taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash
flows and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future. We provide more
information on the transaction in our presentation appendix.
In addition to the TRA transaction, reported results were also affected by a $34 million after-tax negative mark
related to the Visa total return swap, a $15 million after-tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and a $7
million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges.
Additionally, our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a $7 million after-tax impact to provision for credit
losses resulting from our conversion to a national charter. Our earnings materials provide more information on the
various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion.
Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, fourth quarter pre-
provision net revenue increased 14% from the prior year. Our core return on tangible common equity excluding
AOCI also increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 14.8%, while our tangible book value per share
increased 10% from last year.
Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to
manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach
to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future.
Moving to slide 5, total average loans were flat sequentially as Consumer grew 1% and Commercial was stable
from the prior quarter. Our focus continues to be on generating higher quality loan growth to maximize our returns
through the full cycle.
In our Commercial business, similar to last quarter, strong production levels in both regional middle-market and
corporate banking were offset by elevated pay-offs. We have experienced higher-than-usual pay-offs this quarter
in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios as well as in our construction portfolio.
New loan production in regional middle-market banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of
2019. Our new loan originations, particularly in Cincinnati, Chicago and Florida were strong in the fourth quarter.
Total commercial line utilization was stable.
In commercial leasing, our balances continue to decline due to our 2018 decision to hold new originations in our
large-ticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationship-oriented growth. We expect to see lease balances
decline by approximately $300 million by the end of 2020 as a result. Beyond 2020, this impact should be lower.
Average commercial real estate loans were up 1% from last quarter, primarily reflecting draws on prior-period
commitments. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low at less than 80%.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the near-term, reflecting the subdued environment
for corporate capital investments. We will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent
underwriting in the best long-term interest of our shareholders.
Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter, predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of
$1.7 billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years. The decline in
home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of pay-offs and pay downs. Our credit card growth continues
to track in-line with the industry.
The residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially. We expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable
future barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment. In the first quarter, we expect total average
loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially. For the full year 2020, we expect average loans to increase
approximately 4% relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios.
Moving on to slide 6, reported net interest income declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. The purchase
accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter NII by $18 million and our net interest margin by 5 basis
points compared to $28 million and 7 basis points in the third quarter. Adjusting for purchase accounting
accretion, NII was relatively flat with just a $4 million decrease sequentially.
Interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends. The adjusted fourth quarter NIM of
3.22% decreased 3 basis points from the third quarter adjusted NIM, which was better than our October guidance
of down 4 to 5 basis points. Our relative NIM performance throughout this rate cycle has been outstanding.
Our focus on reducing our overall interest-bearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains
very high. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 19 basis points during the quarter, better than our
previous guidance range of 15 to 18 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs in the first
quarter to decline approximately another 8 to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, assuming the Fed remains
on hold.
Combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters, we will achieve a cumulative 30-
basis point decline in interest-bearing core deposit costs since the Fed started lowering interest rates last year
resulting in a 40% beta. On a core basis, we expect first quarter NIM to expand 1 to 2 basis points from the fourth
quarter core NIM of 3.22%, reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward starting hedge positions that became
effective over the past few months.
For the full year 2020, we continue to expect core NIM to be 3.25%, consistent with our October guidance and
down just 2 basis points from our core 2019 NIM, assuming no Fed rate cuts this year. For the full year, we
currently expect net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately 2%.
We expect our first quarter net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline
approximately 2% sequentially, impacted by day counts and the relatively stable loan growth outlook.
Our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows, which may
change depending on the environment.
Moving on to slide 7, we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in October. Adjusted noninterest
income decreased only 2% sequentially, as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than
expected, offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues. Continuing its recent trends,

corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance. Our capital market teams generated record revenues this
quarter, up 10% from the third quarter.
For the full year, our capital market fees were up 12%, following a 15% year-over-year growth in 2018. We are
very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets, especially the growth from our regional
banking clients' activities.
Our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams.
The power of our One Bank model which engages all business lines in meeting our clients' needs is very visible in
our financial results.
We generated very strong 30% growth in corporate banking revenue in 2019 relative to 2018, reflecting the
investments we have made in our North Star Project, in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our
clients. As we anticipated, the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased 23% to $73 million sequentially and increased 35% relative to the fourth
quarter of 2018. Origination volume of $3.8 billion was up 13% from the prior quarter. Our gain on sale margin
was 156 basis points in the quarter, impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and
tightening primary secondary spreads.
Wealth & Asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter, due to higher personal asset
management fees. We finished the year very strong in new AUM flows and expect this trend to continue in 2020.
Deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer as well as commercial. We expect a
stronger year in 2020 in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges based on the trends that we are
seeing.
Our 2019 non-interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope
of product and service capabilities. For the full year 2020, we expect core non-interest income growth of
approximately 8% relative to the adjusted 2019 level of $2.711 billion, including the expected Worldpay TRA
benefit in the fourth quarter. We expect first quarter non-interest income to decline approximately 3%, reflecting
seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue. Our first quarter forecast also does not include any
investment gains. In total, as a result of NII growth and strong increase in fees, we expect to achieve a very
strong 4% total revenue growth in 2020.
Moving on to slide 8. Fourth quarter reported pre-tax expenses included merger-related items totaling $9 million,
intangible amortization expense of $14 million and a contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation of $20 million.
Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense was flat sequentially.
We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB-related expense savings. We continue to
expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020.
Additionally, we expect our total after-tax merger charges, inclusive of the merger-related charges recognized in
current and past periods as well as projected future charges to be approximately $245 million after-tax, which is
$5 million lower than our deal estimate.
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing
of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we would expect our total expenses
in the first quarter to be down approximately 1% sequentially.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Total first quarter expenses, including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately 5% from the
adjusted fourth quarter, which also includes the full impact of the $3.00 raise in our minimum wage to $18.00 an
hour. Although in the short-term, the increase in minimum wage is dilutive, in the long run, we expect to achieve a
stronger financial outcome through lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and
more effective training.
For the full year, there are a number of discrete one-time changes, including the impact of the minimum wage
increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the OCC charter conversion. In addition, we are
planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure which will result in additional in-
year expense growth relative to our recent trends. These three unique items are expected to increase our total
expenses by approximately 1%. We are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of
these items. Excluding these unique items affecting 2020, total expenses should increase less than 2%. In total,
including these items, we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between 2% and 3% compared to adjusted
2019 non-interest expenses of $4.372 billion, which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue
performance that I mentioned.
Regardless of our 12-month outlook which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and
disciplined expense growth, in this uncertain macroeconomic environment we intend to maintain flexibility to
achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions. We recognize that as
we navigate through the environment, investments in projects with lower returns may be deemphasized or
delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic
corporate priorities.
Turning to credit results on slide 9, due to our national charter conversion, fourth quarter credit results were
impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to OCC guidance regarding certain assets which resulted in
an increase in TDR and OREO balances. These changes increased consumer NPLs by $83 million and NPAs by
$113 million which added 7 basis points to the NPL ratio and 10 basis points for the NPA ratio. The same change
resulted in a one-time $10 million increase in charge-offs, all within our consumer portfolio.
Excluding the one-time OCC impact, net charge-offs remained at historically low levels during the quarter. The
consumer net charge-off ratio was flat and commercial was up 2 basis points sequentially. The adjusted NPA and
NPL ratios continue to be benign and in-line with the levels that we have seen all year. The ALLL ratio increased
slightly to 1.1% of portfolio loans and leases, driven largely by two factors: The larger portion of the increase was
due to higher specific reserves for two middle-market commercial loans in two different industries. We expect
these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter. We also increased the allowance in
our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates. As we
discussed before, the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios,
which are expected to run off and result in more normalized charge-offs towards the end of the quarter – end of
the year. Card charge-offs were actually down 20 basis points this quarter compared to third quarter.
With respect to the CECL adoption which is in effect as of January 1, the day one adjustments will result in an
increase of approximately 48% to 50% or between $645 million and $675 million to our allowance for credit losses
which includes reserves for unfunded commitments and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in
October.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
As a reminder, this increase includes the impact of the MB acquisition accounting methodology, pertaining to our
non-PCI loan portfolio and the CECL treatment of reserves which adds more than 10% to the increase that I
mentioned.
As discussed previously, excluding the impact of MB, we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and
consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology. We plan to include a full
description and transition details in our upcoming 10-K disclosure.
Consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of CECL, given the number and
potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the CECL methodology, we expect more
volatility in our quarterly provision expense. Our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various
models and estimations techniques, utilizing historical losses, borrower characteristics, economic conditions and
a reasonable and supportable forecast as well as other relevant factors.
For the expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, we will use three
macroeconomic scenarios. From there, we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on
a straight-line basis. Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL, we will be providing
forecasted net charge-offs for the foreseeable future.
Overall, we expect our full year 2020 charge-offs to remain near historically low levels and be in the 35 to 40 basis
point range which is up just a few basis points compared to the 36 to 37 basis point charge-off rates that we have
seen in the last couple of quarters.
Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit
outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quarter-to-quarter basis given the current low absolute levels of
charge-offs.
Turning to slide 10, capital levels ended the year very strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.7% and our
tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI was 8.4%. Our tangible book value per share was $21.13 this
quarter, up 10% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we completed $300 million in buybacks which reduced our share count by approximately 10
million shares or about 1.5% of our common shares outstanding compared to the third quarter. We expect to
execute the remaining approximately $600 million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this CCAR
cycle.
Between the Worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact of the recent TRA transaction, we
have nearly $0.5 billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the 2020 CCAR
exercise.
As we discussed in the last quarter, the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our
September issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments. We
expect our preferred expense to alternate between $17 million and $33 million every quarter going forward,
assuming no issuances or change in LIBOR.
Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few items: Our fourth
quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years
towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track

to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies. As always, we remain intently focused on
successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through
various economic cycles.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Just as you think about things sort of on a go-forward basis, how much of that proves transitory and how much is,
if any, is sort of a new run rate? In other words, if it was higher-than-expected this quarter do some of those kind
of revert back down or what's the best way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure. Scott, I will make a few comments and I'll turn it over to Frank for the credit piece. We believe that clearly
these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers, which we believe to be
transitionary.
If you look at our guidance for next year, we are clearly expecting continued stability and benign credit
performance away from sort of the accounting-related changes in our credit metrics. This truly was just one of
these quarters where a few credit loans came up. But, Frank, do you want to comment on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank R. Forrest A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Tayfun, I will. And, Scott, we talked about it before, the commercial business; and I've done this a long time is
lumpy. The nature of the business is lumpy. One quarter doesn't make a trend in either direction in the
commercial business and it's something that you manage over an extended period of time.
These two credits are not related to each other. They're both kind of core middle-market companies. Companies
actually we've banked for a long period of time; one's a retailer, one's in the hospitality sector. They're going
through a workout, they happen to hit at the same time. But if you revert back to the year and if you look at our
overall, again, results for the year, we're actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year.
As we said before, our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year. Our outlook for 2020 has really
not changed other than maybe a 2 to 3 basis points increase just given the economy. And, overall, our non-
performing assets for the quarter were centered on these two items, the $50 million net flow at the end of the day.
When we think back to the work we've done in the company intentionally over the last four years, we've
repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles. And we're highly confident – I'm highly confident
we've done that. These are middle-market credits. The increases we've actually seen for the year in our problem
credits have been tied to kind of the lower-end middle market.
A lot of that's reflective of repositioning the rating system from MB. Some of it's in our systems as well. But those
credits tend to be very well-secured and historically have a low loss rate and it's a very granular portfolio which is
what we like to see. When you think about the portfolios, at least in my experience, where we – you should be
concerned as you think about the economy, when an economy slips, it's commercial real estate, it would be your
large corporate book and it would be leverage. And when you think about our commercial real estate book, we
have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans of any of our peers, and that portfolio has
performed exceptionally well and we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional
developers that are essentially investment-grade or near investment-grade with a lot of liquidity.
Our large corporate books performed exceptionally well, our Shared National Credit book. Very low level of
criticized assets and it's very diverse. We manage the risk exposures there, I think, very prudently. And when you
think about leverage – leverage, in our case, we've been focused on reducing that for now – for four years. We've
reduced over $5 billion in leveraged loans in the last four years, which is a 48% decrease that we feel very good
about the remaining leverage book we have today.

We have specialized groups that lend to that sector, both in the line of business and they're tied together with
specialists that we have in risk and we manage it prudently, we monitor it prudently. So our overall thesis, I
suppose, is that when you think about the portfolio of what Fifth Third has done over the last four years, we've
completely repositioned this portfolio for success and we're highly confident that that work will project itself as we
move forward in 2020 and beyond under any economic scenario.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then separately, Tayfun, I was curious on the gain that you got from
the change in the TRA agreement, do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain, as
you do under kind of a more traditional if you were to just sell shares and get an after-tax gain that way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Not with the gain that we booked. I mean, we typically go to the Fed with a specific request. But clearly the first
quarter 2019 gain on share sales, we are able to buy back shares with that.

Good morning.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Can I ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet? You talked about loans growing 4% this year. I'm
wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth you're
expecting on the deposit side overall? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I suspect that's a – I'll turn it over to Jamie with details as well. We obviously have had a very good year, both in
consumer as well as commercial deposits in 2019. We expect that our stable growth in consumer, accompanied
by good growth in households will continue. We do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well
because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership between our treasury management group and our
commercial deposits. Jamie, anything that you want to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Treasurer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And, Ken, this is Jamie. One of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth and
so, for us, we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at 4%. Tayfun mentioned our
focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because, historically,
retail as you know has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the company over the years, so our
focus is getting commercial up to those levels. So we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers.
And then on the retail side, it will be a little bit less than that 4% number in part, because we're intentionally
running down our CD portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher cost CDs around 2% or so right now, re-pricing
them down into the 1.25% range, so we are driving those deposits out the door which results in a little bit lower
retail deposit growth number. However, you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs, both in the fourth
quarter as well as a big support for what we expect in the first and the second quarter of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on the first quarter outlook, you talked about down 2% NII, but you did
indicate that you expect the core NIM to be up and loans stable. So can you help us flush out what the other
deltas would be in terms of you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits? Like what else
– what -it seems like that there wouldn't be so much of a drag on fourth to first?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Treasurer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. From a NII dollars perspective, the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of $10 million, then higher
wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in DDAs, that's about $5 million and then the
13

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
investment portfolio we expect to be down about $10 million from the elevated fourth quarter levels. The fourth
quarter levels include a lot of the year-end one-time mutual fund dividend amounts and that was $6 million.
And so the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth
quarter. And, as Tayfun mentioned, given where rates are right now, we don't expect to reinvest all of our portfolio
cash flows in the first quarter. So we'll be opportunistic. If things change, we certainly have the capacity to
reinvest, but right now we're running portfolio at about 21% of total assets. And that's – we'll probably be in that
21% to 22% range over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year, our NII guidance for the year basically
assumes a fairly flat, even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance. So for those of you who are modeling
investment portfolio numbers for 2020, our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic. But
for now as we sit here at the beginning of the year, we're not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio
balance. If we do see opportunities, if the environment changes that clearly will have an impact on the actual
performance when we get to the end of the year.

Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. On the CECL front, the – if you could help us think about how provision on a day two basis could
shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into 2020 or how we could think about it on a full year
basis on how it's impacted by the adoption? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure. Yeah. I mean I think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision numbers is probably very
similar to others except for when you look at what's driving the higher reserve rates, it really is the longer-dated
loans and some of the consumer credits outstanding. We, as you know, have been very clear on our expectations
with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio. We do not intend to grow that portfolio, not necessarily because
of CECL but just because in the current interest rate environment, I don't think that we're getting paid to grow that.
And home equities have been declining. That's another portfolio that has a relatively large increase under CECL
compared to the incurred methodology. So those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases
in reserve coverage. The one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto. Now, auto CECL is also higher than auto

incurred loss, so that should have a slight sort of increase. But if we continue to grow our commercial book, as we
have done so in the past, that's our biggest book and we will continue to grow that.
I suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from sort of where we are standing but we're all
going to have to wait and see how this plays out. It is without having – not even a quarter under our belt, it is very
difficult to establish good reliable trends given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will
be applying.

Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tayfun. And then separately on the MB side, just want to see if you can give us an update
on banker retention. I know there was some concerns about that a few months back; on some of the headlines
that [indiscernible] (44:26) indicated that you were retaining a majority of your targeted employees as a part of the
deal. You mentioned that last quarter. I just want to get an update on that front and where – how that's been
progressing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
And, John, thanks for the question. This is Greg. First of all, we feel really good about the talent that we have in
the Chicago market as evidenced by the strong production numbers that we're seeing from Chicago.
As you would expect, we have a target of $255 million of expense reduction. So a lot of that reduction shows up in
the form of individuals' [indiscernible] (44:58) expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them. So a
lot of that attrition, you would expect to see that.
I would tell you, in general, 80-plus percent of individuals we offer positions to or with the company have
remained. We feel really good about that. And our ability through our expense targets that we modeled in this
attrition is exactly where we would expect it to be, so there's no surprises here.
We've also taken a best-of-breed approach. So when you think about leadership in that market, right, Mitch Feiger
is the CEO, we retained the best-in-breed we thought to run that company.
There's redundancy. There's optimization that's going to occur. You would expect certain individuals to look for
other opportunities as we modeled in, so – it is very much in-line with what we expected. There's no surprise here
and we'll achieve the objectives we've mentioned. But more importantly, the outcomes in Chicago, we look at our
retail franchise, our wealth business and our strong, strong core middle-market production, we're really excited
about what we're seeing there. And also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that
business into the rest of our business, whether it be asset-based lending, leasing, capital markets into the old MB
book. We feel really good about what we're seeing there and we're very bullish on ability to accomplish our
objectives that we set forth in that market. But there's no surprise here.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And just in terms of corporate banking, obviously you've had really good success over the last couple of
years with that business. And I know your fee growth is obviously higher for 2020, in general, but could you just
talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what you're expecting from that line? I mean is that like how
far forward can we continue to expect sort of those double-digit gains? I'm just trying to understand what's sort of
transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Ken, I'll add to this and then I'll turn it over to Lars for a little more color on this. First off, when you go back and
think about our North Star commitments, a lot of those investments were in corporate banking, capital markets
area. And those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in 2019. You're seeing
that: Strength in 2018, continued strength in 2019. We continue to invest in that area because, once again, it
provides the products and services we need to better support our clients.
And we've had a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in the area. So we would expect
that performance to continue on as we look into 2020 and beyond.
So, Lars, let me give you that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lars C. Anderson A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, Ken, we're really pleased with how the North Star investments foundational have really played out. We
shared with you in particular the re-platforming of our FRM business. We're already seeing the benefits of that.
You can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter. FRM business is really coming back.
It's strong. But in addition to that, a real focus on our advisory model our relationship banking model and aligning
our businesses to both our middle-markets focus as a company as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor,
a consultant which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets
and that is paying big, big dividends for us today.
So an example of that would be Coker Capital that we acquired and that perfectly aligns with our advisory
approach to the healthcare industry. Most recently, you saw the fact that we recruited 12 investment bankers in
San Francisco. It aligns with our renewables and solar business. So that's the theme here; is to continue to build
out a broad platform to serve the industries, geographies and segments that we plan to win in.
Now, look, we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year because
there are macroeconomic impacts on that, but one thing we can do is bring them advice solutions and those are

often tied towards our fee products and services and you're seeing that come through in our corporate banking
success. I'm really proud of the talent that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. That's great. And then just maybe one follow-up question for Tayfun. You mentioned that you're going to
have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in 2020 as part of that 1% extra expense growth
next year. Is there any seasonality related to that? I'm trying to figure out like what's – again sort of what sort of
unusual or first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. There is not, Ken. There's about $11 million, $12 million just the direct fee that we pay to the OCC. It's just
– that's the marginal increase in direct costs but there is no seasonality to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q

And it's just an ongoing expense going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A

I just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier. If the NII or the non-interest income revenue
outlook fell short, there's room to pull the expense lever and potentially do better than the 2% to 3% range to
achieve positive operating leverage for 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. So we clearly – we have always intended to, in the past number of years, to achieve it. We achieved it
every year and we continue to keep the same target. And when you look at the contents of the remaining
expenses beyond that 1% sort of the unique change, Erika, clearly, our largest expense is in compensation, and
there is an underlying inflation built into that and that consumes over a 0.5 point of that expense increase. And, in
addition, there is also another 0.5 point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth. So if the
revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect, we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as
well. And then we're going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out
a slower revenue growth environment.

Hi, Matt.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiments. You did mention that the
payoffs were quite high in 4Q and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending. I think it was the first
quarter. But it seems like maybe commercial or corporate sentiment is improving. Maybe it's just literally the last
few weeks here, but that's one of the themes that we've been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of
the things in the credit market has pointed out as well. So are you seeing some early signs of that or is it a little bit
of a different customer base for you guys than maybe we're seeing elsewhere?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lars C. Anderson A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, Matt. So, first of all, just to address the first quarter, there are seasonality issues in that. So I would really
be looking to Tayfun's guidance for the year. That's what we're focused on is executing in 2020. There has been a
heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of 2019 with some of the global tensions,
tariffs, those kinds of things. But some of the resolution of that, we're beginning to hear some positive things.
We're seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines, not just from a lending but also from a fee
solutions perspective that is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at 2020 and a potential pickup in
18


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
activity levels there. So, frankly, I'm not looking at 2020 with a lot of concern. I feel like that we can go out there
and execute given where we have positioned our resources in the southeast and middle-market banking, in
industry verticals.
But, in summary, there's still a sense of caution, but I would describe it as positively migrating. As you see, a
number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently
completed.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, you reiterated kind of your interest in additional fee deals. You've
talked about this in the past. Just remind us kind of which areas you'd most be looking to complement and are
they sizable enough that you kind of hold back a little bit of your capital versus your target or they're just not going
to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. The capital decisions are independent from that, Matt. I mean because the timing of these availabilities are
random. We've- in the past, we're very clear. Lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory
businesses in commercial, we clearly – if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory, M&A services,
et cetera we will be looking for those. A long time ago, we started talking about potentially adding more capital
markets capabilities in commercial real estate. As they may become available, we will be focusing on those.
We have invested in our Asset Management business. There are opportunities that are financially feasible and
rewarding. We will be looking at those. So it is going to be more business, commercial-oriented, fee-oriented
opportunities. But at this point what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the
opportunities. If we see the opportunities, we will execute them regardless of whether we're sitting on $0.5 billion
of capital or not.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. First, I wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit. First, on the commercial side, you
obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credit; you also had a big increase in NPL
formation in commercial. I think $165 million on page 21. I think, Frank, you mentioned that was also related to
those two specific credits but I just wanted to confirm that was the case?
And also on CECL, Tayfun, just again a clarification and I have to sharpen my pencil on this but I think your
allowance takes your ACL ratio to like 160, 170 bps. I guess what you're saying is that obviously there's volatility.
There are more things driving quarterly provision, but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in
that range and, yeah, we should be modeling provisions with charge-offs and growth. Is that sort of the right way
to think about it? So a couple of questions, more a clarification question.

I'll take the CECL one and then I'll turn it over to Frank. I think your numbers are right in the ballpark, Saul. And,
yes, I mean sitting here looking at sort of balance sheet progress without necessarily having a perfect knowledge
of macro scenarios, I can only assume that it's probably going to stay around those levels. But obviously, after a
couple of quarters under our belt, we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this.
Frank, on the credit side?

Frank R. Forrest A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp

Frank R. Forrest A

And just as a reminder in the workout business, things are lumpy. I mean it's – you don't package things up in a
neat package and you have even inflows and outflows. We look – we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and
look to see if there's any particular trends that are bothersome to us and we didn't see anything there; in
particular, it spread out.
I will say the flip side of that is we had a really strong quarter on collections. So our net at the end of the day was
$50 million, which I think about as sort of those two credits that were there before, so that's the story there. And,
again, it doesn't – I don't think portend anything different in our outlook for 2020. We feel very good about 2020
based on where we sit today.

to replace those loans this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs. We will make
loan decisions independent of the payoffs. But, Lars, any comments on that?

Fifth Third Bancorp

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Lars C. Anderson A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No, so actually going back to a previous question, just so that you understand the build that you see and
we have seen both in middle-market, in corporate banking increasing volumes of loan production throughout the
year. And that is really encouraging which I had mentioned about 2020, so with my optimism.
On the flip side and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet, a softness in the industry that we're
seeing has been pay downs – elevated pay downs. However, the complexion of that changed in the fourth
quarter.
In the fourth quarter, rather than just deleveraging some of our portfolio, what we saw were the two biggest
drivers was; number one, higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline
there and that's a positive thing. It's strengthening our balance sheet and it's not that we will not extend credit into
the leveraged lending market but we're being very disciplined and selective in that market.
The second piece of it goes back to what Frank said earlier. We saw pretty significant pay downs in our
construction lending line of business, which I shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would
begin to occur as a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle. So maybe a little bit more
than you asked, but to kind of frame it, we do not see that leveraged lending will be a growth area for us or a
period of time this late in the cycle.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on your GreenSky relationship. I notice you guys
had renewed that relationship. Just at a top level, any changes to how you're thinking about appetites for those
types of credits or – and then I guess more specifically, were there any changes in the terms as a result of that
renewal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tayfun Tuzun A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I can't necessarily – yes, we renewed the relationship and we renewed the relationship having had the experience
with GreenSky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance.
Having said that, we believe that the renewal actually benefits us in the way it was done, the way it was structured
from a credit support perspective as well pricing perspective. That's all I'm going to comment given the fact that
they are the counter-party to the agreement, but we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal
discussions.
