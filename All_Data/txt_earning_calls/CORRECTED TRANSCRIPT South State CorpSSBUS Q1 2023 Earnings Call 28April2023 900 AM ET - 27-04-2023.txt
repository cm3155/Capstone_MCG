Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
All right. Thank you, Will. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for making time to join us. In March, we passed
the third anniversary of the pandemic shutdown of the economy. It also marked the third anniversary of the Fed's
massive quantitative easing response.
Last year, however, the Fed made a hard pivot from fighting the pandemic economy to fighting the inflation
economy and, intuitively, we've all been worried that the speed and scale of that pivot would result in casualties.
Well, those casualties showed up in the banking system on March 8.
In spite of the recent turmoil, the SouthState team delivered results that were right in line with our previous
guidance. During the quarter, we produced growth in loans, deposits, liquidity, and our capital ratios. Earnings per
share of $1.83 increased 32% from the same period last year that yielded a return on tangible common equity of
about 19%.
In the weeks following March 8, the market identified two immediate risks, liquidity and capital; and also two
longer-term risks, earnings and credit. I'll briefly touch on each.
On liquidity, we've been building a diversified and granular deposit base for decades, and we came into this rate
hiking cycle with $6 billion in cash a year ago. SouthState manages 1.5 million deposit accounts with an average
deposit size that is the lowest of our peer group at only $24,000 per account. So that granularity adds stability and
a lower percentage of uninsured deposits.
On page 26, we've itemized $19 billion of available liquidity sources to cover less than $11 billion of uninsured
and uncollateralized deposits, and that provides 176% coverage ratio. So, there's ample liquidity.
On capital, in the weeks following March 8, there's been speculation about the regulatory response and whether
unrealized losses will eventually be reflected in regulatory capital ratios. On page 27, we show a waterfall to
illustrate that SouthState remains well-capitalized on all regulatory ratios if you include the impact of AOCI.
Additionally, we calculated it to include the impact of both available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity
securities, and all of our regulatory ratios still exceed well-capitalized requirements. Those capital ratios should
continue to build as the balance sheet grows at a more moderate pace. In fact, tangible book value per share
increased 6% during the first quarter.
On earnings, like most banks, the biggest risks to our earnings forecast are deposit costs. We finished the first
quarter with a cumulative deposit beta of only 13% and a total cost of deposits of 63 basis points, which came in
right in-line with our prior guidance. And that low beta helped our PPNR per share to grow 62% over the last year.
Given the events on March 8, that earnings growth ramp will moderate, and Steve can share some updated
thoughts in the Q&A on potential deposit betas moving forward.
And finally, on credit. Asset quality metrics remain excellent and stable; however, we are conservatively building
reserves. Over the last four quarters, we added $123 million in loan loss reserves compared to just $3 million in
charge-offs. And with the increasing focus on the office segment, we added a new slide in the deck that Will can
touch on in his remarks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Stepping back from current events, every shakeup like this presents new challenges and new opportunities. And
this management team has been involved in nine FDIC transactions and knows what it's like to manage through a
cycle. That's why our guiding principles of soundness, profitability, and growth start with soundness.
We will continue to have opportunities to recruit new bankers, and we're already seeing opportunities to command
higher loan spreads as industry liquidity is becoming scarce. And it doesn't hurt to be located in the most vibrant
markets in the country.
The Southeast is known for its friendly business climate and capital flows, where capital is treated well. It seems
like every month there is an announcement of a new multibillion dollar manufacturing facility with thousands of
new jobs in the Southeast. And those job opportunities are leading to population migration. Based on the latest
census report, SouthState operates in four of the six fastest growing states in the country.
I'll conclude my remarks by thanking our team. You can never predict when a black swan event will occur. But
those are the times when long-term client relationships matter the most, and SouthState's relationships run long
and deep.
And now, I'll turn it over to Will to walk you through details on the quarter.

William E. Matthews
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll speak briefly to a few measures before we open it up for questions. From a high level
perspective, our first quarter margin and deposit costs were at or slightly better than our prior guidance. After the
events of March 8, we decided to build a bit more liquidity on the balance sheet. Our tax equivalent NIM of 3.93%
was down 6 basis points from the fourth quarter, although it was approximately 9 to 10 basis points better than we
had budgeted.
A 40-basis-point increase in earning asset yields was offset by a 46-basis-point increase in cost of funds. Cost of
total deposits increased 42 basis points, in line with our guidance of a 40 to 50 basis point increase from last
quarter. Our interest-bearing deposit costs remained slightly below 1% at 97 basis points.
Loans grew at a 7% annualized rate, in line with our expectations, predominantly in single family residential, up
almost $400 million. Line of credit utilization remained flat, with C&I line usage actually down 2% from Q4 and
HELOC usage flat.
Deposits grew at a 1% rate. Included in that deposit growth is brokered CD issuance of $1.25 billion during the
quarter. We had budgeted and planned to issue $1 billion, but went ahead and issued an additional $250 million
late in the quarter, in light of some of the industry concern.
Excluding brokered CDs, our deposits declined approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter. Of that amount,
approximately $400 million was normal public funds drawdowns after Q4 tax collection season. We did see
continued growth in the number of core banking deposit accounts, debit cards, and customers in the quarter.
We had $900 million in FHLB borrowings outstanding as we elected to carry more cash on the balance sheet at
quarter end, with cash and Fed funds balances up $700 million.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Noninterest income improved $8 million over the fourth quarter, led by correspondent and mortgage and steady
performance and in wealth management. Noninterest expenses continue to be well managed, with NIE of $231
million, up $3 million from the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected for the quarter.
We had another quarter of very low credit losses with net loan recoveries excluding overdraft losses and only $1
million in total net charge-offs. We added to the reserve levels again this quarter with a $33 million provision
expense, $18 million of which was for unfunded commitments.
The combined total of our allowance and reserve for unfunded commitments stood at $456 million at the end of
the quarter, up 8 basis points to 1.48%. As John noted, that's $123 million in provision expense versus only $3
million in net charge-offs over the last four quarters with net loan recoveries before including overdraft charge-
offs. And we expanded our reserve coverage by 23 basis points over this period.
Slide 22 shows asset quality trends over the last five quarters. These metrics continue to be very solid. NPLs to
loans of 41 basis points were up slightly from Q4 and down slightly from the 2022 first quarter. NPAs were up $19
million, and criticized and classified assets were essentially flat, with substandard loans down $12 million and
special mention loans up $10 million. Past dues were also down.
Given the current interest in office CRE, I'll mention a few highlights with respect to that portfolio. As noted on
slide 21, office CRE represents approximately 4% of our outstanding loans and 97% of this portfolio is in-market.
The portfolio is very granular with an average loan size of less than $1.5 million, and the vast majority of the
properties are smaller than 150,000 square feet and not located in a Central Business District.
Our weighted average debt service coverage is 1.64 times, and our weighted average loan to value is 59%. Credit
metrics on this portfolio are also strong, with very low levels of delinquencies and only 1 basis point on
nonaccrual.
Additionally, we've added some disclosures again on slide 25 covering deposits, liquidity, and capital. Our capital
position continues to be strong and, as John noted, would remain so if regulatory ratios were changed to include
AOCI.
All-in-all, while the last month of the quarter was rather tumultuous for our industry, we believe we're well-
positioned with a strong capital base, granular deposit funding, continued strong revenue, and solid credit metrics.
Operator, we'll now take questions.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Catherine Mealor of KBW. Catherine, your line
is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Hey, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:12:27) you keep Steve up for the deposit beta question, so I thought I'd start there and just
wanted to get your thoughts, Steve, on how you're thinking about the acceleration in deposit betas over the next
couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Catherine, this is Steve, good to talk to you. And, of course, John throws me the softball, so here I go. Let
me [indiscernible] (00:12:47), so let me just kind of, first of all, just talk to the deposit beta. Obviously, let me kind
of put it in context of margin in general. And this may be a little longer winded than you want, but I think it kind of
describes the overall perspective.
John and Will both mentioned, we had a really good NIM in the first quarter, 3.93%. Our guidance was
somewhere for the year between 3.70% and 3.90%. Deposit costs were within our guidance, which we were
really excited about.
As we talk to you about margin, I'm going to give you the same guidance for 2023 with a few updates in the
assumptions. And just with the caveat, when the industry experienced towards the 1st of March, it really changed
our thinking around how much liquidity to hold, as well as our customers' desire for more rate sensitive products.
So, as we think about the three assumptions, those three assumptions haven't changed. Number one, it's the size
of our interest-earning assets; number two, the assumption of interest rates; and then number three is the deposit
beta question you asked.
So, first around interest-earning assets in January, we talked about on the call our guidance of an average $40
billion interest-earning asset base in 2023, and we have no change to that. Two, we talked about interest rates,
and in January the Moody's consensus forecast was for Fed funds to move up to 5%, and then be lowered 25
basis points by the fourth quarter of this year. But based on the new Moody's baseline forecast, we expect Fed
funds to peak at 5.25% here in about a week, and then stay there all the way through 2023.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
So, on page 16, our graph shows our cycle-to-date beta is at 13% versus our historical beta at 24% in the last
cycle. As a result of the banking industry turmoil in March, we are estimating that our deposit beta will rise – or our
deposit costs will rise 45 to 50 basis points in the second quarter, bringing our cycle-to-date deposit beta into the
low-20s versus our historical 24%.
If the Fed stops raising rates in the second quarter based on history, we'd expect deposit costs to continue to
move up at a much more gradual pace in the back half of the year. This could cause full cycle data to increase a
few percentage points. To be honest and humble about the whole answer is we don't really know. It's been a
unusual change in March.
But having said all that, we're confident in our deposit base, and it seems to be doing well. With all those new
assumptions around interest rates and timing of deposit betas, we'd expect our full-year 2023 NIM to stabilize in
the 3.60% to 3.70% range into 2024.
So, just one last point. If over the next two years, Moody's baseline is correct and Fed funds falls into the low-3s
with a slightly upward sloping yield curve, the environment is very favorable for us as our interest-sensitive
deposit rates will be lowered while our assets [ph] that are (00:16:24) adjustable and fixed will still reprice higher.
Our deposit franchise continue to perform and provide a real stable margin environment, but really net interest
income driven not by margin but by growth in interest-earning assets. That's a long-winded answer, but hopefully
that gives you context.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Well, deposit beta was in there somewhere [indiscernible] (00:16:44).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. No, that was awesome as it always is. Thank you. It's very helpful. So, [ph] maybe few (00:16:49) follow-up
to that. So, on your average earning asset comment that the size is the same at $40 billion, is there a shift within
that, where we have a little more cash, maybe less loans with a more moderate loan growth outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
That's right. I think we're – back to the – John mentioned the four things that everybody talked about on March 8,
liquidity, credit, capital, and earnings. We're probably going to carry a little bit more liquidity just through this time,
just prudently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
But I'd say, Catherine, not any dramatically bigger liquidity position. I think early on we all were trying to figure out
what was needed in light of all the uncertainty. And we all spent a lot of time increasing on our contingent liquidity
sources, and we've got a slide on that in the deck. And I'll say we're continuing to do that post-quarter end and
increased it further from there. And so, having access to the liquidity is important, but I wouldn't say we're going to
dramatically increase the size of balance sheet – liquidity on balance sheet by big numbers.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, back to the deposit conversation, so there we're seeing a lot of remix out of noninterest-bearing
into interest-bearing across the industry. So, with your deposit beta guide – and you're giving a total deposit beta,
that's going to include that remix, how much of shift do you expect to continue to see out of noninterest-bearing
within that guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Kind of when we look back at history, our DDA is – today is 34% of our total deposits. Pre-pandemic it was
in the high-20s. So, you know, I'm not sure that it's going to go all the way back there. But you kind of have to
assume that it's going to continue to drift. But we don't know. I would imagine that we would track pretty much the
industry, however that's going to play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And I think one other thought around that is, I do think it's around business deposits. And of course, as we talked
about on this call 100 times is, we have a pretty granular deposit base that's sort of between retail, small
business, and commercial. And we have that slide that shows the granularity of each. Really, the remix is
primarily in the commercial space and not in small business and retail. And that's been pretty steady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe just one follow-up just on that point is, are you – what kind of behavior have you seen? I agree I
think that deposit betas have mostly been driven in the commercial side really across the industry. But as you look
at your small business and retail piece, did you see any change in behavior pick up especially after the March
volatility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
I think it probably woke the entire customer base up just around excess deposits. So, there was some excess
deposits that were sitting in checking. But really primarily, if you looked at it from March 8 on, it was really more of
a business remix than it really was any retail or small business. And then, within business, there was more
volatility with nonprofits or folks who are managing other people's money, they were a little bit more sensitive to
the issues on March 8.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Can I give you an interesting statistic? We had – our call center volume at two weeks following March 8 was a
normal total volume. It was 66,500 and something calls, and only 30 calls having to do with FDIC insurance
coverage. So, 5 basis points of the calls, which surprised me how little call center activity we had around that
subject.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I was just looking to drill down a little more into the comments about slowing balance sheet growth. So, from what
I remember, I don't think you guys had – were guiding to rapid growth. I think you had last said mid-single-digit.
And so, if we're going even slower than that, maybe just help us with, does that happen quickly? Does that
happen steadily over the course of the year?
And is that more driven by the demand and what the Fed has done, the Fed's getting what it wants in the
economy? Or is it more you guys really proactively tapping on the brakes just given the economic cost of funding
alone, the credit concerns, etcetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Kevin, it's John. I think our previous guide for 2023 was that we would have mid-single-digit loan growth for
the year. We came in at 7% in the first quarter. I can imagine that that loan growth may be more heavily weighted
to the first half of the year and things would maybe slow down in the back half of the year, as you have a lack of
liquidity in the system, and just price discovery between buyers and sellers.
So, from our C&I borrower standpoint, I think that business is still good, but a lot of them are kind of in a wait-and-
see mode before they make major capital expenditures. The M&A activity slowed down in C&I. CRE has slowed
significantly, and we're seeing some of our peer banks back out of that space. And so, we want to be selective
there.
Multifamily is still strong because a lot of folks are still priced out of the single family market, and we've got a lot of
population migration here. And industrial demand is still real strong near the ports, particularly. We've got less
than 1% vacancy rates in Savannah and Charleston on industrial.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
So, I just – I think there's a lag effect, Kevin, with the Fed interest rate increases. We were growing loans in the
mid-teens in 2022, 7% in 2023 in the first quarter. I still think the mid-single digits for the full year feels about right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay, great. And maybe just a quick check on expenses. I know – I think last quarter you told us about a $950
million run rate for the year. And now we're – I think you said expenses came in a little better than your
expectations at least. Is that still the outlook? Or given that things are getting tougher on the top line, is there
going to be more scrutiny on the expense line? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Kevin, it's Will. Hopefully we're always applying the appropriate level of scrutiny to our NIE base and
everybody applying that ownership culture as they think through their NIE base. I did reference we were a little
better than target. I think we had in the first quarter maybe budgeted about $1 million more still pretty much on top
of it. We still think the $950 million is a good number.
Obviously, in an environment like this, though, you do rethink, do we need to necessarily make this higher or that
higher that we may have had approved in the budget? Is that something we can hold off on and make sure that
we need to do it? Those kind of decisions that, hopefully, our team of owners will think through that way.
There are factors that are harder to predict. One is loan production volume and the impact that has on the
capitalization of loan origination costs, which is an offset NIE, so lower production leads to lower cost offset in that
regard or higher NIE. But sitting here through the first quarter, I'm pleased we're a little bit ahead of budget on
NIE. I still think our guidance for the full year feels about right at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. And just what I would add to that, Kevin, is just big picture is that we're continuing to work on our platforms
and spend money on those to make sure that we've got a really good customer employee experience. And we
think that that's going to pay dividends out in 2024/2025.
And so, to Will's point, we're always trying to manage expenses to the lowest common denominator and ultimately
create. And then, there'll always be opportunities again in environments like this where there'll be teams of people
and other things that we'll have the opportunity to hire, and you want to have the ability to do that. But I think
within all that, we're going to manage the expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And one other point I'll make, too, just as you're thinking about modeling, our typical – most of our
employees' annual increase cycle is a July 1 increase. So, you'll see that's a third quarter event every year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Appreciate that. And then, Steve, one thing I just – it was a nice rebound quarter for correspondent. Just
wondering if that's a sustainable pace or how we should think about that one.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
To your point, correspondent had a great quarter this quarter. Kind of the way that we think about that business is,
obviously, the interest rate swap revenues had a really good quarter. Fixed income is difficult right now just
because of the way the yield curve's shaped and cash [indiscernible] (00:26:44) balance sheet.
But the way I kind of describe it is until the Fed's done hiking rates and we get some stability, which should come
in the next – maybe toward the back half of the year, these interest sensitive businesses like mortgage and
correspondent probably will stay lower.
So, I wouldn't expect – I mean, the first quarter is really good, and I would kind of go back to our original guide on
that to be in that 55 to 65 basis points of assets until the noninterest income [ph] to be that (00:27:14), until the
Fed stops raising rates, and then we kind of go to 60 to 70 basis points after that, because we just need some
stability for those businesses.

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I guess, I was kind of curious at a high level how do you think if in any way your
business model has kind of changed with all the turmoil from March 8 and beyond? Everybody seems to think, oh,
regional banking model is somehow dead now. I'm just kind of curious what your views are on that at a high level
and how you think your business model may or may not have changed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, Stephen, it's John. I think about our business model and a couple of things come to mind. Number one is
the local market leadership in our business model, we have 41 regional presidents and they manage their own
balance sheet and their own income statement. And I think that has proved to be very valuable when it comes to
managing deposit cost and deposit betas.
In a headquarter-centric type of business model, you're making all of these interest rate decisions at the
headquarters. And I think it's much, much better for the local market leaders to figure out where they need to
shoot the bullets on pricing deposits for their very best customers rather than someone guessing hundreds of
miles away. So, I think that part of our model has been very, very valuable.
The other piece of the model is it's a diversified model. You heard Steve talk about the diversity of the deposit
base, one-third retail, one-third small business, one-third commercial treasury. And you go back to 2008/2009,
what got the banks in trouble? It was concentration on the loan portfolio. You look at this cycle what got banks in
trouble was concentration on the deposit side.

So, I think our decentralized leadership model is proving to be very valuable. And I think the diversity of our
business mix has proved to be very valuable and kept some stability. So, I don't know that that we're thinking
about this crisis as something that's going to change the way we do business. I think it's proven to be resilient.

open. Please proceed.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hust wanted to go back to mortgage for a second.
The gain on sale margin popped up. You had about a better quarter if you back out the MSR gain. I think you just
made some comments, I might have missed them, but just wanted to get kind of the outlook there.
And then on the balance sheet side, you've been portfolioing more of the mortgages, which obviously contributed
to this quarter's growth. Just wanted to get the outlook there for how much you might plan on a quarterly basis to
portfolio going forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Michael. This is Steve. Yeah, you're right, the gain on sale did come back a little bit this quarter. I think our
total production was around $556 million, of which we portfolio at about $400 million of that. So, not quite – I think
it's 72% portfolio. The adjustable ARMs on that was 78% of that. So, most of it's just we're putting on in ARM,
adjustable-rate mortgages.
As we kind of think about the future, we don't see a huge run up in that business for a while until things stabilize a
little bit. I think what we're seeing most and why we have so much portfolio production is we have an owner –
person who is building a house, there's just not enough inventory, and so they're doing that kind of a CP loan that
turns out into an ARM on our balance sheet. Typically, these are professional doctor. I think the number was in
the mid-40% of our portfolio of production with that in the first quarter.
So, we're seeing a lot of those types of opportunities, which obviously [indiscernible] (00:31:41) the wealth
management and so on. But we're not seeing any huge pickup in sort of the traditional secondary business, at
least right now. Certainly it's come off the lows a little bit. But my sense is, like anything else, like all these fee
businesses, these are opportunities for us to build – to continue to rebuild and build these businesses.
And so, we're actively recruiting mortgage bankers. We're actively recruiting some of our correspondent group.
We're actively doing all those things, not because it's going to pay off in the next three to six months, but because
it'll pay off in the next 12 to 24. And so, that's kind of how we're thinking about investing in those businesses.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. Maybe just going back to deposits, just wanted to kind of talk about flows. So, obviously, you guys
added some broker this quarter. You had the seasonal decline in public funds. Just excluding those two kind of
impacts, the core deposits obviously went down. Can you just talk about trends, kind of since everything
happened in early March, and have you seen balances stabilize to maybe perhaps grow? And then, what is the
plan going forward to grow core deposits? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Michael, it's Will. I'll start, and maybe John or Steve can jump in and elaborate. I'd say, the events of March
8 probably caused us to be a little more focused on deposits within our market and – within our various markets.
And so, our sales [ph] hat (00:33:26) on the deposit side became a little more important from that point forward.
And so, I think what you'll see from it at this point forward, I think, is a lot more activity in that regard.
If you look at the March 8 to March 31 activity, essentially in that period, you saw our commercial deposits down
about $400 million. Our other deposits in the rest of the bank is up about $100 million. So, net-net over that
period, you're down about $300 million.
We have a lot of swings in the various categories, obviously, from period to period and what's going on, so that's
not a real precise measure. But like I said, we were surprised how few calls we had to the call center. Maybe John
can touch on some of the activity we have with [indiscernible] (00:34:14) some of our customers right around that
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I go back to January, even before the March 8 events and we were seeing some drawdowns of deposits in
January. And I don't know a lot of that was the public funds fees that's seasonal. Things stabilized in February.
So, we were feeling really, really good about the stability of the deposit portfolio in February, and then naturally
things picked up and the runoff picked up in March.
April, we started this deposit campaign and things stabilized again until you get to tax day. And so, that's kind of
the ebbs and flows the last few months. But for us, Michael, the important thing was after March 8 that we instilled
confidence in our front line bankers and we met with probably 100 or more of our leaders on that Monday
morning.
And I think the market correctly identified the risk to the system or uninsured deposits and the size of deposit
accounts. And we had some great data Monday morning to share with our bankers that SouthState had the
lowest average deposit size of any of our peers, and we had one of the lowest uninsured percentages of total
deposits. I think that gave our bankers a lot of confidence, and that confidence in turn translated to our customers;
confidence.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
One other I'd point too, I mentioned the commercial deposits. Our commercial line of credit utilization fell by
roughly 2% during the quarter. So it looks like businesses tend to use their cash before they use our cash, so to
speak.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the insights. Maybe just finally for me. I know capital is a precious
commodity at this point, but the stock has definitely come in. You guys have a buyback in place. Any thoughts on
using it? And if not, kind of near term, what would kind of change the calculus for you? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I think in the near term, Michael, we think capital – continue to allow capital to accrete and build is wise,
and that having capital as a strength will allow us to be more opportunistic should some opportunities develop
coming out of this. And as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got a history of doing that.
So, in our view, for the foreseeable future, we continue to plan to let capital accrete. It'd be good to get some
guidance, some clarity on regulatory changes and even the regulatory changes that don't necessarily affect banks
below $100 billion statutorily or regulation-wise, that kind of guidance often flows downhill.
So, we'll want to be able to understand and digest that as well. Longer term, having a clearer picture on credit,
growth, etcetera, will allow us to figure out what's the best way to use what's hopefully still a very good capital
formation rate.

Steve, I wanted to follow up just on the line of thought on the noninterest-bearing. I know it's really hard to predict,
but you did give expectations for margin for the rest of the year. And so, it sounded like you were expecting some
further mix there based on the other comments you gave. So, just wanted to ask within your margin guidance,
what are you guys expecting for noninterest-bearing deposit mix?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Yeah. I don't know that we would say that publicly. We just don't know, honestly. But we have some – we
definitely think there's some movement from 34% into the high-20s. We don't know if all that happens in the next
two quarters or it happens over the next 18 months. We're just not really sure.
So, I would just assume that we're going to be a lot like the industry and seeing the continued remix. I think this
quarter is about 7%. So, I would assume that that probably trends maybe another quarter or so, and then after
that stabilizes. Because I think what's happening right now is, there's a wake-up moment on March 8, and that's
probably, I would expect, until the Fed stop raising rates – let's assume they stop raising rates in May, that there's
some remix over this next quarter. And then we probably get the most of that remix out of the picture, I would
think, that'll dribble in over the next two to four quarters after that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. I did also want to ask just on the correspondent bank, could you give us a sense for what
amount of your deposits come from your correspondent relationships and how those trended from 12/31 to 3/31?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
That correspondent business, we have a couple hundred million dollars in DDA, a few hundred million dollars in
money market account, maybe a couple hundred million in – I'm going to guess $600 million maybe. We've
always been pretty intentional about that business relative to being a fee income business versus a deposit-
gathering business. And we do gather deposits. We have about $1.5 billion that sits off balance sheet with the
EBA, which we sort of [indiscernible] (40:06) wires and ACHs come through us. But instead of us put that $1.5
billion on our balance sheet, we send it to the Fed. So we've always been pretty disciplined around how much of
that we wanted to put on our balance sheet at any point in time. So, hopefully, that's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, that is – I appreciate that. And then I had two last questions. Appreciated the office slide. I did want to ask, is
that – is there owner-occupied office included within that 4% of the total portfolio that you put out there? And if
there is, do you have a sense for what that portion is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
That's the non-owner occupied office space, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. Thank you very much for that clarification. And then, I did just want to ask, again, on the non-owner
occupied portion, I guess maybe I should have triangulated the office exposure before I asked that question, but
you did give the other non-owner occupied CRE portfolios.
I did just want to ask on the hotel and the nursing home – I know the nursing home is a very small portion for you.
But I did want to ask, what's kind of – what causes those two loan portfolios to have higher substandard and
special mention ratios than the rest of the book? I'm particularly interested in the nursing home. Just wondering if
there's anything special going on there.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, you bet. Hotels is a carryover from COVID. And as we get financial statements on these hotels, we're
continually upgrading those and we see that trend continuing. That's just a hangover from COVID. Actually, hotels
are performing very, very well right now. The convention business is about back to normal. Tourism in Florida is
about back to normal. So, we do not forecast problems in the near term in the hotel space.
On the assisted living space, it's less than 1% of our loans, but we had a couple of new facilities that came online
during COVID. And basically it's healthcare cost, the fear of COVID, and the facilities are a little slower to become
occupied.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Do you – I know it's really a small portion of your book, but is that a trend I guess when you kind of look
across assisted living facilities and the deals that kind of come across your desk? Are you seeing kind of that
slowness in lease up or in occupancy across some of the newer facilities that are being built versus maybe some
of the older ones that already had higher occupancy rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I just think that that is a challenged space because of COVID. And I think it'll be slow to come back to what
it was prior to COVID. So, I mean, I think it's just an overall COVID issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Brody, we saw [ph] most of that (00:43:10) problems with labor inflation and labor shortages that kind of got
it from all [ph] all ins (00:43:16). As you said, it's not a big space for us nor is it big – much of an appetite for us.
And we've had those on downgraded status really for a good while now. We've got two nonaccrual assisted living
facilities. Both of them are current on their payments, so we don't anticipate a loss there.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So. Hey. So, I just wanted to know if you could help us how we think about with loan yields and how they can
increase from current levels, [ph] maybe you (00:44:33) get to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing. Steve, I know
you mentioned that 45 to 50 basis points increase of deposit cost in the second quarter. But how much can you
offset that with loan yields repricing? And then, how does that kind of trend towards the later half of the year when
the Fed pauses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brandon, it's a good question, and that's kind of why we think there's stability in the back half of the year
with margin. If you look at our book, we've got about – we have a slide in the deck that talks about our fixed rate
book. So, call about half of it is fixed rate. We've got about – so that's about $15 billion or so.
We've got about $8.7 billion that's floating daily, so that probably has one more rate hike in it. And then we have
about $3.6 billion that is going to be adjustable here in the next 12 months, and its weighted average rate is

4.07%. So, if it's based on a one-year Treasury or what have you, likely that's going to reprice and [ph] fix it
(00:45:39) somewhere.
And then we have some other adjustable that'll reprice, about $2.6 billion that'll reprice out past – further than a
year. So, as we think about loan yields, we had a pretty significant move in loan yields. I think it's 41 basis points
for the portfolio in the first quarter. I would say that probably will be 15 to 20 over the next couple of quarters, and
maybe we crest out at end of the year somewhere between 5.50% and 5.75%, somewhere there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. Very, very helpful. And then on the deposit side, what is kind of the continued appetite for brokered
deposits? And could you share kind of what the rate in maturity the brokered deposits were that you raised in the
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Brandon. If you kind of – I'm going to give you a short answer and a long answer. The short answer is
we did about $1.250 billion at about – is [ph] right out of (00:46:42) 5% coupon and it's got three quarters of a year
duration. So, that's the short answer.
The longer answer is if you kind of look back at these times of stress, times when – like I'll go back to March of
2020, we sort of did the same thing. We borrowed, I think, about $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion of brokered deposits
because it was really uncertain in March of 2020 about small businesses, pandemic.
So, the way we think about it is, that's a source that we can get to quickly that we sort of [indiscernible] (00:47:14)
for the balance sheet, but over time we would expect that to probably continue to ebb down. If you went to pre-
cycle, pre-pandemic, December of 2019, I think we had about 3.5% of our assets were in either home loan bank
or brokered deposits. So that's probably a good long-term average. Today, we're at 5%. My guess is we'll drip
back down over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Makes sense. And then, lastly on credit, net charge-offs continue to be very low. And some of your peers
have already seen some normalization or blips. I'm just curious, just how much longer do you think you can keep
net charge-offs at this level and kind of when do you think that pace of normalization will start to begin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Good question. And we'll have to just see how this cycle unfolds. But for the quarter, we actually have net
loan recoveries. And I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks. we've set aside $123 million of reserves
[indiscernible] (00:48:21) last year. But I think if you look at the loan portfolio, we've got a lot of detail in the
appendix there about our loan to values. They're in the high-50s. So, we feel like we've got great equity and great
sponsorship with our clients. We're just going to have to see how this cycle plays out. This is unlike anything
we've faced in our careers from a liquidity standpoint, but we like our hand and the book that we've got.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q

Yeah, David, this is Steve. What reiterated earlier was kind of that mid-single-digit loan growth. We reiterated $40
billion interest-earning asset base. So, we would expect – I think we ended up a little bit higher than that. If you
looked at a spot basis on interest-earning assets at the end of the quarter with a little bit more cash, I'd imagine
that cash would come down a little bit, but that's sort of our guide. So, I don't think it's a huge move either way.
