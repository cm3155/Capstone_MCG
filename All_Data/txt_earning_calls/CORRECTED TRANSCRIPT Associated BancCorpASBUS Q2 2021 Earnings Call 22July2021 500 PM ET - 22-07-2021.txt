Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Chris
Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. Now, we're going to get to our financial
results in a moment. But with this being my very first official earnings presentation since taking over as
Associated's President and CEO back in late April, I'd like to start by taking a moment to reflect on what I've
learned in my last few months on the job and why I think the future is bright for Associated.
Under Phil Flynn's guidance, Associated built a strong reputation based on disciplined approach to credit, capital,
operational risk and expense management. As an outsider looking in, I saw a clean balance sheet, a strong
capital position, and a franchise known for great customer satisfaction. These are all very attractive foundational
qualities to build upon. And qualities I've been able to validate since my arrival.
Upon joining Associated, one of my first priorities was to listen and learn as much as I could both from internal
and external stakeholders. What's working well for our company? What are our growth opportunities? What we
must do to win more customers and deepen community engagement?
We started with 100 days of listening and a listening tour. And we have held over 175 largely in-person sessions
with hundreds of colleagues participating and thousands of ideas shared. Throughout this process, I have
personally spoken with over 300 colleagues across our footprint. I've also spoken directly with some of our largest
customers and many of our key investors. And with this feedback in mind, we've already taken several actions to
drive performance across the organization.
First, knowing that competing digitally is more important than ever, we promoted Doug Peacock, who was
previously our Director of Strategic Channels to lead our digital strategies going forward and build a
comprehensive digital roadmap across our entire consumer and business bank.
Secondly, we have refocused our wealth management teams under the leadership of John Thayer, CFA,
previously, our Chief Investment Officer and a seasoned wealth management professional, who will lead our
integrated strategic vision for a business that already has many strengths.
And finally, we are centralizing our FP&A team to bring additional discipline to the execution of our line of
business activities. Our cross group activities, and importantly, the growth initiatives we intend to formally
announce later this quarter. We are actively working on these strategies and initiatives and we expect to lead to
additional growth and positive operating leverage. We will communicate those strategies to no later than
September 13.
Now, let me touch on the business environment in our markets and our second quarter highlights as outlined on
slide 3. The first half of 2021 has been marked by encouraging transition to a new normal. We continue to see
many signs of strengthening, the strengthened economy in our markets. Many businesses in the Midwest are
running at full capacity. In fact, we are seeing really large gatherings.
Gatherings such as those of our newly minted world champion Milwaukee Bucks, which we just got to see outside
our door today during their championship parade. Encouraged by these trends, our frontline teams have been
back and front of clients and working directly with our customers for much of the year. We're optimistic about
growth and feel Associated is well positioned to participate in the ongoing recovery.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
In fact, we start to see signs of increase in lending activity and line utilization in our commercial portfolios, which is
reflected in our period-end loan balances. Commercial and business loans, excluding PPP, grew by nearly 3%
quarter-over-quarter, while the CRE segment of our loan book grew by nearly 1%. And further, our PPP – and
further, our PPP portfolio continue to pay down as expected with period-end loan balances in PPP down over
50% from the first quarter. We find all of these trends encouraging.
We also began to see signs of increasing customer confidence in spending activity with deposit and card fees up
$2 million from the first quarter and credit card spend up 19% quarter-over-quarter and 40% year-over-year. Now,
shifting to credit. We continue to be very pleased with the improving credit environment over the first half of 2021,
which speaks to resiliency of our customers and to the resiliency of our core markets. Non-accrual loans were
down 10% quarter-over-quarter and net charge-offs remained flat at just $5 million. After posting a negative
provision of $23 million in the first quarter of 2021, we posted another negative provision of $35 million for the
second quarter. Taken together, charge-offs and negative provision combined to drive a net reserve release of
$40 million for the period. And finally, we've repurchased $30 million of common stock for the quarter and also
added $0.40 to our tangible book value per share.
Now turning to slide 4. Let me highlight a few quarterly loan trends. Compared to the first quarter of 2021,
average second quarter loans decreased 1%. However, on a sequential quarter-end period basis, we saw solid
growth in several of our commercial, CRE, and specialty lending portfolios, including REITs, general, commercial,
and power and utilities, as our customers began to modestly draw on their lines. As expected, PPP loan balances
continued to decrease, declining by $431 million or more than 50% as we've seen the SBA accelerate their
paydown and forgiveness processing.
We continued to enjoy strong mortgage originations during the second quarter. We've originated over $2 billion
year-to-date, but we remain reluctant to add low-rate mortgages to our balance sheet. After seeing significant
refinance activity in Q1, this activity carried over into Q2, driving our residential mortgage and HELOC balances
modestly lower during the quarter.
Looking forward – looking towards the back half of the year, we remain optimistic around loan growth.
Specifically, we are optimistic about commercial loan demand and still expect full year commercial loan growth
that is CRE and C&I combined, excluding PPP of approximately 2% to 4%.
I would also like to provide an update on our indirect auto lending initiative. As mentioned back in April, we are
expanding our consumer lending platform to add indirect auto lending to our product set. We continue to build out
the infrastructure and expect to begin booking loans during the fourth quarter of 2021.
While adding auto allows us to diversify and add to our total – our consumer portfolio at slightly better spreads, we
are also continuing to evaluate other consumer and commercial verticals with good lending characteristics.
Slide 5 provides a bit more color around the period end trends that are giving us confidence that we are on track
to meet our full year guidance for commercial loan growth. At June 30, our commercial and business lending
segment, excluding PPP, grew by 2.8% for the quarter, while CRE grew by 0.6% during the quarter as well.
Combined these two segments represented roughly 2% on a period-end basis, which is in line with our full year
expectations.
Moving to slide 6. We continue to see record deposit levels for Associated customers and second quarter average
deposits were up $1.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. This continued growth has reflected strong trends in our
lowest cost deposit category averages, which grew approximately $2.4 billion from the same period a year ago.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
From a period end quarter-over-quarter standpoint however, we began to see signs of increasing business
confidence. Combined DDA balances from our corporate and commercial specialty segments, which includes
trust, were down by 12% or nearly $450 million from the historic highs at the end of the first quarter. We see this
as a positive sign that businesses are putting their money to work in our economy.
During the quarter, we also continue to work down our average higher costs network and time deposit balances,
which decreased by approximately $1.6 billion from the second quarter of 2020. And on a related note, our
aggregate wholesale funding levels decreased to approximately $3 billion at the end of the second quarter and
have steadily decreased over the past five quarters. In addition, last week, we exercised an early redemption
option on $300 million of our 3.5% medium-term bank notes which will also help our margin going forward.
On slide 7, we provide a walk down of our quarterly pre-tax pre-provision income or PTPP, first quarter to the
second quarter. Adjusting for the MSR write-ups and onetime gains recognized in Q1, you have – you can see
our run rate has held steady and our net interest income is beginning to move higher. With net interest income
increasing, we believe we have reached an inflection point on PTPP. In addition, the growth initiatives and
efficiency strategies we will be rolling out later this quarter are intended to capitalize on our market strengths and
position us to drive positive operating leverage and expand PTPP over the next several quarters. We do believe
the expansion in PTPP over the second half of 2021 will more than cover the incremental costs contemplated for
the initiatives on deck.
So, let me pause there and hand it over to Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a little further detail
on our margin and income statement trends for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 8. We had previously indicated that net interest income and net interest margin
would gradually start to expand over the last three quarters of 2021, based on slowing refinance activity, a steady
decline in liability costs, and expected loan growth. In the second quarter, we started to realize the benefits of
these factors with net interest income rising. Similarly, while quarterly NIM continue to be pressured, we saw an
encouraging uptick from month to month with the June NIM finishing at 2.45%, up nicely from March.
Slide 9 provides a breakdown of the specific factors that lifted net interest income in Q2. On the mortgage side,
margins and investment income were driven higher by decline in refinance activities, which contributed to slower
prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. We expect mortgage yields to continue to rise
over the back half of the year as the refinance wave continues to taper.
On the commercial side, we saw an uptick in PPP income recognition relative to Q1. We had approximately $15
million of unrecognized deferred fees remaining at the end of the quarter and expect that most of that will be
realized over the back half of the year. On the liability side, we continue to see downward momentum in overall
deposit cost quarter-over-quarter. This is especially true for time deposits where average yields have continued to
decline period-over-period.
Average time deposit yields finished the second quarter at just 51 basis points, and we still have about $50 million
in consumer CDs with rates above 2% set to mature by the end of the third quarter. Given the second quarter's
margin, current CD rates and market trends, we continue to expect our full year net interest margin to finish
between 2.45% and 2.55%.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Turning to slide 10. Second quarter noninterest income came in at $73 million, up from $68 million in the same
period last year excluding ABRC-related income, but down from the $95 million in the first quarter. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease was driven primarily by a decline in mortgage banking income amid the tapering refinance
ways. Partially offsetting this, fee-based revenues continue to expand led by service charges, deposit account
fees and card-based fees. Fee-based revenues overall increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter and 16% year-over-
year.
As shown on the upper right, mortgage banking gross gains of $9 million were down quarter-over-quarter due to
sales margin compression. Despite the sales of Whitnell, which closed in the 1st of March this year, we continue
to see strength in our wealth management business. Wealth management fees saw a slight increase in Q2 after a
strong first quarter. And we're pleased to have ended the quarter with over $13 billion of assets under
management, up 12% year-over-year. Given we are halfway through the year, we are tightening our range of our
full year fee income outlook to $315 million to $325 million.
Turning to expenses on slide 11. The first quarter came in at $174 million in total expenses, a slight decrease
from the first quarter and a 5% decrease from the same period last year. Personnel expenses rose for the quarter.
However, other core expenses including occupancy continue to trend lower, more than offsetting the additional
personnel expense we saw.
Turning to capital on slide 12. Our tangible value per share continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and has
increased 7% year-over-year to $17.35. Associated's regulatory capital levels also remain strong. Our common
equity Tier 1 ratio has grown 45 basis points in the second quarter of 2020, as we conserve capital in light of the
economic uncertainty we saw over the last year. We continue to target a TCE level at or above 7.5% and a CET1
level at or above 9.5%.
With that, let me turn it over to Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Chris. I wanted to start off by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 13. We utilized the
Moody's June 2021 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast
assumes additional fiscal support, a continuing low interest rate environment, the recent acceleration in consumer
prices to be transitory, and a relatively localized COVID cases.
Following a net reserve release of $28 million in the first quarter of 2021, we posted a further net reserve release
of an additional $40 million in the second quarter. This net release was driven by gross reductions in our
allowance for all of our core business units with a $12 million gross reduction in our allowance related to our
general commercial and business lending portfolio, a $13 million reduction in our CRE allowance, an $11 million
reduction in oil and gas, and a $3 million reduction in retail lending.
As of June 30, our total ACLL was $364 million, down from $404 million in the prior quarter. Similar to that, our
ratio of reserves to loans declined to 1.52% from 1.67% during the quarter. We had previously guided that we
expected ACLL to loans to drop back down to CECL day 1 levels by the end of 2021. And halfway through the
year, we're in line with those expectations.
Turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide 14. Potential problem loans and non-accrual loans both
declined during the quarter with net charge-offs flat from the first quarter. Our key COVID commercial exposures
also continue to decline, notably oil and gas, retail and restaurant exposures all declined during the quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
After peaking at $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020, our quarterly active loan deferrals have continued to
decline each quarter and fell to a total of just $20 million across all core business units in the second quarter of
2021. Total deferrals now make up just 8 basis points of total loans at quarter end. Most customers who received
deferrals have not needed additional assistance and they have been able to resume making normal payments.
Going forward, we expect to adjust our provision with changes to risk grades, other indications of credit quality,
and loan volume.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to the second half of 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. On slide 15, we recapped our updated guidance for 2021. We are tightening our noninterest income
guidance and now expect the full year to come in between $315 million to $325 million reflecting the strong
mortgage activity we see in the first half of the year and to continue to strengthen our wealth management
business over the course of the year. As a result of our ongoing planning for growth and efficiency initiatives, we
are withdrawing our prior 2021 total expense guidance.
Before the impact of such initiatives, we expected total expense for 2021 will be approximately $695 million to
$700 million, reflecting incentive accruals and additional business development expense. Now, our total expenses
for 2021 will ultimately reflect the impact of the initiatives that we will announce later in Q3.
But let me reiterate. Even with the expenses we're contemplating to support our growth initiatives, we still expect
to deliver PTPP above our second quarter baseline in each of Q3 and Q4. Lastly, as mentioned, we continue to
experience positive credit trends due to economic conditions. And as such, we expect provision to be adjusted
accordingly, inclusive of risk grade and future loan volume.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, Chris, maybe the first one for you. So, year-to-date the margins are around 2.38%, so it looks like you'll meet
some good acceleration in the second half. And I imagine PPP fees later this year are a big part of that. But
maybe to the extent you could, would you mind please refreshing thoughts on sort of the ex-PP margin? I know
you've got some of the CDs rolling off or that – that should give you a little bit of a tailwind. But just maybe
thoughts on sort of the ex-PPP puts and takes, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Absolutely. So, as I stated, we're anticipating to have the benefits and you restated now of the CDs repricing
which will come to us. We're anticipating seeing the benefit of having payoff the medium term banknotes which
we fully paid off last week. We're anticipating to see a sort of stabilization of LIBOR at hopefully what we expect to
be slightly above today's levels as we move towards the back half of the year. And we're expecting to see loan
growth. And those four factors together will all drive our margins meaningfully higher from even where they were
in June.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right, perfect. And then, similarly, so on the fee side, you'll need a little acceleration to get toward the middle or
high end of that range. Just curious about the main drivers. It sounds like wealth management is going to be sort
of a key growth area for you. But, same kind of thing, maybe puts and takes you would see as we look into the
second half of the year on fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We certainly expect wealth management which typically sets its fees for the subsequent quarter based on
quarter-end levels to have a good quarter given that June 30 was a pretty good point for the markets. We also
expect to see deposit fees continue to come in nicely. And based on what we've seen in card fees [indiscernible]
(00:25:01) that can also be a positive as we move to the back half of the year.

Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
There you go, step in the right direction. So, just wanted to follow up and maybe put a bow kind of on the expense
commentary. So, I think you said it would – the increased expenses would be kind of covered by the incremental
PPP fees you expect in the second half, so maybe if you could just kind of put a dollar amount on that. And then,
on an ongoing basis, are those kind of onetime expenses to put things in place and get people hired, or is a lot of
that going to be in sort of the longer-term expense run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. This is Andy. Let me just clarify that. It is PTPP that we believe will cover that as opposed to PPP. We
clearly are seeing an increase in net interest income. And so that increase in net interest income, we believe, gets
buoyed even additionally by margin increases that we expect in the third quarter.

So, right now, we're finalizing our growth initiatives. We do anticipate making an investment in our company and
recognizing the current environment that we're in as we come through the pandemic. But even after any new
investments that are made in the third quarter or the fourth quarter, we do expect to exceed the Q2 PTPP, in each
of, individually, the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And thanks for the clarification. Sorry, I didn't hear that correctly. And then my – I guess my
other question was sort of more on the capital front, just as you guys are looking at sort of deploying capital
you've been active with the share buyback, but there's also a lot of these kind of growth initiatives that you're
investing in as well. So, just trying to kind of think about or understand how you guys are kind of weighing the
payback period of various investments kind of across the platform and how that will pertain to future capital
allocation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I'll start that one out and maybe have Chris piggyback on this one. So, as we look at our growth initiatives,
of course, growth and funding growth is our number one priority. So, when we think of operating leverage,
obviously, in a prudent risk fashion, we don't believe we have to step out of our credit box. We will finalize the
initiatives and we expect there'll probably be a shift in the use of capital, a little bit away from maybe not quite as
much on the share repurchase as much on the growth.
So, as you have positive operating leverage, you invest in businesses that drive your margin, you do that in a
prudent risk framework. We think between the – the growth will be number one. And then we'll also of course look
at what dividend strategy and share buyback strategy is combined. So, as we finalize those numbers, we'll pull
that through to the capital plan as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

That was well said, Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, I was going to ask maybe Chris could kind of add a little bit more on the financial metrics side. So,
are you looking at certain like tangible book value, earn-back periods or anything like that or recoup of investment
timeline? Does your hiring teams are adding new origination platforms et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
We are. And we look at those internal rate of return metrics on a variety of measures. The good news is, typically,
the addition of incremental adjacent lines don't have significant other costs other than people, and people tend to
pay for themselves very quickly. So, we are pretty encouraged by the early measures that we have and we look
forward to announcing more of that news later this quarter.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
A question for Andy. As you were out on the road the last 100 days listening to your colleagues, I'm just curious,
the ideas that they were presenting would you – could you put them into called the expense bucket and then the
revenue bucket kind of where you'd kind of line those up and maybe just the technology bucket as well given the
promotion to the individual to run the digital strategy. What were the comments you heard internally on your digital
platform relative to your competitors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, yeah, great questions, Terry. And I guess, what I would say is, we have a serviceable digital strategy today,
but we'll be looking for a lot more. And what I'm encouraged by, in fact, when I talked to Doug Peacock, maybe
the reason I promoted him is the first thing he said is, don't be afraid to be bold. And when we think about the
world that we're living in and the attack on fintechs, we have a legacy trust advantage.
And so, I believe this in my prior job when I took on digital and omni-channel, I believe it firmly in this position. So,
we will look at a combination of what our product strategy is, what our digital delivery strategy is and certainly we
will have to spend money in digital. The exact amount of that is what we're finalizing right now.
What I'd heard from our colleagues as well is we want to -- we want to grow. We want to participate in the markets
that we're in, inherently, small business in commercial or local businesses still. We expect to compete very well in
small business in commercial. And those will be a focus as we're trying to finalize our plans as well. So, the things
that I heard there and I, in fact, I heard it from the investment community as well. And I think one time they said,
we want a reason to follow you and for you to be bold. And that's what we expect to deliver on come September
11


Associated Banc-Corp

13 or before when we have our plan. So, when we talked about evenly listening to the investment community, our
customers and our colleagues, that's exactly what we've done.
And interestingly, the feedback wasn't that far apart. The thing that I find encouraging was when you start with
listening and you get to as many folks as we have, and it wasn't just me, it's our entire executive leadership team.
When you understand that the nuance of what is on people's mind and you bring strategies forward that deliver on
that, you typically get by in an execution. So it's been a really good 90 days getting to know our colleagues,
having a reason to talk to them in person, getting to know them personally, but also to know what they want from
our company.

Great. Great color, Andy. And then as my follow up question, reading here though there is a runoff now of the oil
and gas portfolio, which maybe I missed that last quarter, but that's not my question. I guess, the $31 million
reserve against that portfolio and it was much higher on day one, as that goes down, should we expect then the
ACL ratio to move below that that day one level of 1.55%?

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Pat. Pat, why don't you take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. We do expect ACL to continue to decrease below CECL day one. Specific to oil and gas, as we continue to
wind that down, we're less than 1% of total balances in oil and gas right now. So we would expect that trend to
continue and that does have a big effect looking back to CECL day one in terms of the ACL.

Okay, great. Andy, I just want to make sure I've got the right starting point on the PPNR, the guidance from here. I
guess, is that like a mid-80s, low- to mid-80s, like $83 million run rate for Q2? Is that what you're using?

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe while you're digging that up, maybe broader, Andy, I appreciate the expense comment on the – we have to
wait for September. Do you envision laying out kind of medium-to-longer term, just high-level profitability targets,
ROE, ROA, efficiency? I think that's one of the things that we would be looking for. I just wonder if that was going
to be included in that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Our plan is to show what the investments are, what the payback period is, and what that does to the key
drivers, whether that's our ROTCE, whether that's our efficiency ratio, whether that's our operating leverage.
Those are all categories that we know that you're going to want to see and we're walking through that right now to
make sure that it's what we need and expect for the company and externally. So we're very much trying to align
with what we heard, what our strategies are, and how that hits our key ratios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's – that'd be great. And then, lastly, can you just – the CECL day one you referenced, I missed that

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Yeah. We're currently equal to where we started. CECL day one at about 1.52%. So we can expect to see that
trend down given where non-accrual loans are going, potential problem loans have decreased. Where it will flow
down to, we'll get back to that. With our oil and gas, it could get down to that 1.25%, 1.30% range, but we
continue to watch that.

Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A couple of follow-up questions, bigger picture. Andy, can you talk about – give us a little more detail on the
centralized FP&A? And what's behind that? Talk about that a little bit and how it aligns with your growth initiative?
Help us understand that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Absolutely. Look, they're fun things to talk about when you talk about driving revenue and you talk about changing
culture and you think about all the good things you can do in product. But those things are only as good as your
disciplined approach to execution. And so, as we come out with additional initiatives, all at once, we want to make
sure that our tracking is in place. We want to make sure that we are clearly understanding the timing of each
piece. We want to know how that rolls up to our key financial metrics. We want to make sure that that rolls into our
monthly business reviews. We want to make sure that rolls into our forecast. And so, having a team, in my mind, I
see it as a best practice. I've experienced that in my past stop. And you really get down to the granular piece –
granular pieces of it and we know what to expect and we know quickly what we need to correct or emphasize.
And so, when we bring that centrally under our CFO, it's still incredibly tied into the line of business. However,
when we're doing our performance forecasting, budgeting and tracking of initiatives, to me, that was a really
important thing that I want to have a view on all the time. And so, getting that in line as we make promises to both
our colleagues and to the investment community, I don't want to let either side down. And I think this is the best
way to get to that point.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's helpful. On your listening tour and maybe Pat or Chris can add in in on this. But what did you hear from
commercial customers? Not necessarily on the reputation of Associated, but in terms of their level of optimism or
bullishness on the growth outlook. And maybe to Pat or Chris, is it much different than it was a quarter ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Let me start that one out and then I'll defer to Pat as well. I mean, I was with 20 of our customers last week. And
what I'm hearing is a general level of increased activity, whether that be thinking about a buyout of someone,
whether that's M&A, whether that's thinking about equipment purchases. There is just – it seems to be the
beginning of something. So, I believe that we see slight increases in our – we do see slight increases in our
pipelines. We are seeing that slight drawdown on business deposits. We see a slight increase in line utilization.
But more than that, anecdotally, I can tell you, it is almost as if there's a pent up demand that is starting to move.
So, anecdotally, those are the conversations that they had and that we've heard.
There's, of course, talk about supply chain. But some of them were saying, gosh, we have as much going on right
now as we can handle. Now, we want that to improve. But to me that will be additive and that will not stop the
recovery. Pat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I would – I would agree with that. I think the – some of the overarching themes we're hearing is demand is
outpacing supply. There's a lot of catch-up going on from last year. Obviously, many of our clients still have
liquidity and they are – as Andy mentioned, they're starting to deploy that, whether it'd be investment in new
technology, equipment, et cetera. And again, I think like a lot of the country they're dealing with supply chain and
labor constraints that are really the only things holding them back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks for that. And then, maybe one more for you, Andy. Bigger picture here, but how do you think about the
geography of the company? And I'm thinking about markets like the Twin Cities, Chicago and St. Louis, which
kind of ring the perimeter of your franchise? And I just – they're big markets where you have smaller share and
I'm just curious how you're thinking about those markets. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, absolutely. So, look, I'll just do a quick overview. Northeast Wisconsin, we have a stronghold and we have
really deep roots and meeting those customers you feel the presence of Associated, the value of long-term
relationships. We want to make sure we maintain those.
I moved to Milwaukee and clearly a population concentration. That's why I'm splitting time between Milwaukee
and Green Bay as in-office time. But we expect to do very well in Milwaukee. But with that, you get discipline on
the small business side and the commercial side. And to me, those are businesses you can scale without having
a massive footprint. So, we would expect on the small business side and the commercial side to compete quite
well in Chicago, in Minneapolis. We haven't focused as much on St. Louis yet, but what we intend to do is show
that we can compete in the major markets Then you look midterm and you build out your digital strategy and that
15

makes you attractive in every market, rural, urban, large, small. And so, that will be a point of emphasis for us on
the midterm.
So, that's how we're thinking about it right now. As we get into our growth initiatives and execute on those, I
believe that will open up optionality for us both from a market standpoint and then ultimately from a scale
standpoint and potentially a second step in the merger and acquisition market.

Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions.

Hey, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wondering if you're able to quantify the modest increase in line with utilization that you referred to a couple of
times and maybe give us a sense for how far below pre-pandemic levels that those lines are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll take that, Daniel. This is Andy. We think we hit a trough, a bottom in April and it was in the very low 30s, 30%
on line utilization and we were up 2% at quarter end. Now, historically speaking, as we look at that, that's about
10% below what our historic numbers are. So, we think there's room. We are not forecasting a massive increase
to that, but modest increase to that. So we're seeing evidence that that will – that we clearly have room. And we
see capacity from our customers of over $7 billion to drawdown. So – so we believe that the growth will be steady,
slow in the second half, but that will be enough to meet that 2% to 4% commercial and CRE growth target that we
have out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. Terrific. And I guess on just also sticking on the commercial and growth side, the – if you have any
commentary on what pay downs look like in the second quarter relative to prior quarters?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. We certainly saw a fairly healthy amount of activity, but obviously, in our core commercial books, we had a
net increase [indiscernible] (00:44:03). And so for the overall bank, obviously, new transactions exceeded all net
pay downs. And we had a fairly nice [indiscernible] (00:44:23) roll over of the shorter term loans. So, it was a net
positive for us.
