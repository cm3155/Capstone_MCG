Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Kristie, and good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Last week, Paul and I attended our
Summer Development Conference for our employee advisors. It's exciting to spend time with so many advisors
who embody our client-first culture. We hear firsthand what makes Raymond James a great place for advisors
who value the breadth of our technology and product platform so they can effectively serve their clients. And
importantly, a firm that provides advisors the tools they need to grow their businesses. Paul and I appreciate the
passion and dedication of the thousands of advisors who continue to serve their clients day in and day out.
Turning to our quarterly results. We once again delivered strong results in the quarter. Our diverse and
complementary business combined to generate record results for the first nine months of the fiscal year. We
continue to invest in our businesses, our people, and our technology to help drive growth across all of our
businesses.
Beginning on slide 4, the firm reported record fiscal third quarter net revenues of $3.23 billion, an increase of 11%
over the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees. Quarterly
net income available to common shareholders was $491 million or $2.31 per diluted share, excluding expenses
related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $508 million or $2.39 per
diluted share. We generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity of 17.8% and
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21.9%. A great result, particularly given our strong

capital base. During the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $243 million, bringing our
fiscal year-to-date total to 5.1 million shares for $600 million.
Moving to slide 5. Client assets grew to record levels during this quarter, driven by rising equity markets and solid
advisor retention and recruiting and PCG. Total client assets under administration increased 2% sequentially to
$1.48 trillion. Private client assets and fee-based accounts grew to $821 billion and financial assets under
management to $229 billion. Domestic net new assets during the quarter were $16.5 billion, representing a 5.2%
annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.
Our robust technology capabilities, client-first values, and long established multi affiliation options continued to
retain and attract high-quality advisors to the platform. This quarter, we recruited to our domestic independent
contractor and employee channels, financial advisors with approximately $92 million of trailing month production
and $13.4 billion of client assets at their previous firms. Including RCS, we recruited client assets of $14.9 billion,
making this our best quarter since 2021 in terms of recruited assets.
Fiscal year-to-date, trailing 12-month production of recruited advisors is up 33%, and related client assets are up
52% over the prior nine-month period. These results do not include our RIA and Custody Services business,
RCS, which also continues to have recruiting success and finished the quarter with $167 billion of client assets
under administration. We continue to experience growth in RCS from external joins as well as from internal
transfers. This quarter, we reported record financial advisers of 8,782 and that does not include internal transfers
to RCS of nearly 50 advisors, primarily all from one firm. While transfers RCS lower the firm's advisor count, the
client assets typically remain with the firm.
Looking at fiscal year-to-date results, domestic net new assets were $47.7 billion, representing a 5.8% annualized
growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic Private Client Group assets, a strong result compared to peer
group. Total clients, domestic sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion,
down 3% from March of 2024. We are pleased to see cash balances remain relatively flat in the quarter following
fee billings paid in April. Bank loans grew 2% over the preceding quarter to a record $45.1 billion, primarily due to
higher securities based loans as demand for C&I loans remains muted.
Moving on to slide 6. Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.42 billion and pre-tax
income of $441 million. Year-over-year, results were bolstered by higher PCG assets under administration due to
strong equity markets and net new assets brought into the firm. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly
net revenues of $330 million and a pre-tax loss of $14 million. Net revenues grew 20% compared to a year ago
quarter, primarily due to higher debt and equity underwriting revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 3%,
primarily driven by the higher affordable housing investment revenues. Pre-tax loss in Capital Markets segment of
$14 million reflects weak M&A results and the impact of amortization of deferred compensation granted in
preceding quarters, which totaled approximately $20 million this quarter. While the timing of closings remain
difficult to predict, we are still optimistic about our healthy pipeline and new business activity in M&A. We continue
to expect investment banking revenues to improve along with industrywide gradual recovery.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $112 million on record net revenues of $265
million. Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year
quarter, due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts. The Bank segment generated
net revenues of $418 million and pre-tax income of $115 million. The Bank segment net interest margin of 2.64%
declined just 2 basis points compared to the preceding quarter.

Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $9.36 billion and record
net income available to common shareholders of $1.46 billion, up 9% and 12% respectively over the previous
record set in the prior year. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 18.2% and
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.5% for the nine-month period.
On slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Asset Management segment for the first nine months of the year primarily
reflects the strong organic growth in PCG, along with robust equity markets.
And now I'll turn the call over to Paul Shoukry for his remarks. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. First, I just want to echo Paul's comments earlier on how great it was to attend our Summer
Development Conference last week, as well as our Elevate conference earlier in the quarter and visiting several
branches over the past few months. We truly have a fantastic group of financial advisors and associates who put
their clients first each and every day.
Now, turning on to slide 10. Consolidated net revenues were a record $3.23 billion in the third quarter, up 11%
over the prior year, and up 4% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew to $1.61
billion, representing 17% growth over the prior year and 6% over the preceding quarter. This quarter, PCG
domestic fee-based assets increased 3%, which will be a tailwind for asset management and related
administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter. Brokerage revenues of $532 million grew 15% year-over-year,
mostly due to higher brokerage revenues in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income
shortly.
Investment banking revenues of $183 million increased 21% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Compared to
the prior year quarter, third quarter results benefited primarily from stronger debt and equity underwriting
revenues. However, M&A and advisory revenues remained subdued.
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Saving Program (sic) [Enhanced Savings
Program] balances ended the quarter at $56.4 billion, down 3% compared to the preceding quarter and
representing 4.3% of domestic PCG client assets. So far, in the fiscal fourth quarter, domestic cash sweep
balances have declined about $1.25 billion, as cash inflows have partially offset quarterly fee billings of
approximately $1.5 billion.
Turning to slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $672 million, down
2% from the preceding quarter. The Bank segment net interest margin was relatively flat at 2.64% for the quarter,
while the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks decreased 18 basis points to 3.41%. The
decline in third-party yield was primarily due to a mix shift towards higher yielding sweep offerings. Based on spot
rates at the end of the third quarter and current balances, we would expect NII and RJBDP third-party fees to be
flat or perhaps down nominally in the fiscal fourth quarter. But, of course, we are always monitoring the
competitive environment which has been notably dynamic in the space over the past few weeks. This guidance
does not factor any incremental changes we may make to sweep rates based on these competitive dynamics or
other factors.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Compensation expense was $2.09 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 64.7%. Excluding acquisition-related compensation expenses, the
adjusted compensation ratio was 64.4%. Non-compensation expenses of $494 million increased 6% sequentially,
5

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
largely due to a favorable legal and regulatory net reserve release of $32 million in the preceding quarter that did
not recur in the current quarter. Generally, non-compensation expenses grew this quarter, as expected, to support
growth across the businesses. For the fiscal year, we still expect non-compensation expenses, excluding
provisions for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items or non-GAAP adjustments, to be around $1.9
billion, consistent with our previous guidance.
Slide 14 shows a pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we generated a pre-tax margin of
20% and adjusted pre-tax margin of 20.7%, a strong result, especially given the challenging market conditions
impacting capital markets. These results are in line with the targets provided at our recent Analyst and Investor
Day Meeting in May.
On slide 15, at quarter end, our total assets were $80.6 billion, a 1% sequential decrease as loan growth was
offset by declines in cash balances and a continued runoff of the securities portfolio in the Bank segment.
Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well
above our $1.2 billion target. With Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.7% and total capital ratio of 23.6%, we remain well-
capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in
growth.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the quarter, the firm
repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $243 million at an average price of $122 per share. As of July
19, 2024, approximately $945 million remained under the board's approved common stock repurchase
authorization.
Going forward, we expect to continue to offset share-based compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with
incremental repurchases. Given our present capital and liquidity levels, we currently expect to increase the pace
of buyback activity, as we are committed to maintaining capital levels in line with our stated targets.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and Tristate Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total
loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.15%, down from 1.21% in the preceding quarter. The bank loan
allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1%. The
allowance percentage has trended lower, largely due to a loan mix shift towards more securities-based loans and
residential mortgages, which account for 34% and 20% of the total loan portfolio, respectively. The bank loan
allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 2% at
the quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to closely monitor economic
factors that may impact our loan portfolios.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. I am pleased with our strong results this quarter. And looking forward, we are well-positioned
with record levels of assets and bank loans starting off the fiscal fourth quarter. And while there is still economic
uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength to drive growth over the long term across all of our
businesses.
In the Private Client Group, next quarter's results will be positively impacted by the 3% sequential increase of
assets and fee-based accounts. Our advisor recruiting activity remains robust, and I am encouraged by a record

number of large teams in the pipeline. We are focused on being a destination of choice for current and
prospective advisors, which we believe, over the long term, should continue to drive industry-leading growth.
In the Capital Markets segment, we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels, but
our expectations are for a gradual recovery and are heavily influenced by market conditions. And we expect
activity to pick up over the next few quarters. And in the fixed income business, although we've seen some
improvement in depository, results are still lagging historical levels. Depository clients continue to experience flat
to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on the
brokerage activity. We hope once rate and cash balances begin to stabilize and grow, we will start to see an
improvement. Overall, despite some near-term headwinds, we believe the investments we've made in the Capital
Markets business have us well-positioned for growth once the market and the rate environment become
conducive.
In Asset Management segment, we remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts in the
Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we
expect Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further growth over time.
In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diverse funding sources and
prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate, and
demand for these loans increase as clients get more comfortable at the current level of rates. Corporate growth
has been muted, as market activity remains low. However, with ample client cash balances and capital, we are
well-positioned to lend once activity increases within our conservative risk parameters. In addition to driving
organic growth across our businesses, we also remain focused on corporate development efforts. While we prefer
to deploy capital through M&A, we plan to increase the pace of buybacks as we continue to look for opportunities
that may meet our disciplined M&A parameters.
I expect you have several questions related to the industry news regarding cash sweep changes that have
occurred over the past few weeks. We have been monitoring these emerging developments closely, like you
have, and, frankly, probably have some of the same questions. We are prepared to attempt to answer any
questions you may have.
In closing, we are well-positioned entering the fourth quarter with strong competitive positioning in all of our
businesses, and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth. I want to thank our advisors and all of
our associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients. Thanks for all you do.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one
follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cho with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And I will go ahead and start with the regulatory piece. I mean,
Paul, you mentioned, you talked to through the income and RJBDP fee kind of doesn't include potential
considerations, maybe changes in rates on sweep cash, I mean, and you mentioned competition. So, I guess,
how would you characterize the current changes in the competitive environment from your view, from your seat?
And is there a way to frame the magnitude or even type of response [indiscernible] (00:23:34), whether it's either
competition or regulatory on this front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Let me start. The other Paul, there's two Pauls here. But let me start by saying, first, people are talking
about, well, what's the difference to this program, that program? Our sweep programs are very, very different. So I
want to set the stage first that, if you look at our sweep programs, we offer from 25 basis points to 300 basis
points. The programs that people have been talking about offer 1 basis point to 50 basis points. So we start off
with a whole different value proposition. We have $3 million of FDIC per individual, or $6 million joint in the sweep.
We have also, in our programs, very competitive money market partners, our institutional class available to
everyone irrespective of the size of investments. And you can see how those have grown dramatically. We have
Enhanced Savings Program, again, offering higher rates and up to $50 million of FDIC insurance, which you've
also seen grow. And our advisors and clients, if you look at the share, have taken appropriate actions to invest the
money. So I don't know what's happening in some of the other programs. I can tell you, ours are well thought
through, we think are very compliant. And as we look at the announcements and changes, they're not very
specific yet, right? So we've prided ourselves, subject to criticism, even from this group, maybe at times for having
such high sweep rates. But we've done it because we believe, both, it's the right thing to do and it's regulatorily
compliant with what we understand.
So we're going to have to look at movements, and each of the movements have been a little different. We don't
even know totally what they apply to. So we don't see anything that we know of today that's forcing us to change
rates. But we meet weekly, and we're going to be competitive. So, if the competitive landscape of rates change,
we have to be competitive both for our advisors and our clients. So, that was more of an unknown comment,
saying if things happen, we're going to adjust. But, as of today, we're looking at stuff, but with no current plans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Now, thanks for the clarification and the thoughts there. I guess, just for my second question, I just
wanted to zoom out and ask a broader business question and kind of trajectory for Raymond James ahead. I
mean, you've talked through continue to hit record assets, record revenue, record bank loans. And I realize you
have some margin targets out there for the broader company. And clearly, there are some aspects and nuances
happening real time as you just talked through, Paul. But, I guess, how would you frame the trajectory for

operating leverage in the business, as this backdrop continues to reach record levels for Raymond James,
despite maybe some rate normalization ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the operating leverage, as we grow assets, we believe we can accomplish it. There are a
number of factors [indiscernible] (00:26:48) whole industry has had a strong equity market, maybe until the last
week or two. And cash spreads have also continued to support the businesses. But we believe that as we grow,
and especially our use of technology in the back office, and I know that's one of Paul's key focus as we transition
over this next year to double down on that, we believe we can get operating leverage and still be able to keep our
very high levels of support to our advisors. And our latest survey gave us 95% in the satisfaction rate, almost 60%
Net Promoter Score on service. So we believe that's a hallmark. But we believe, with technology, we can make it
better and easier for them as we continue to spend more money in that part of the service [ph] . And the reason?
Better (00:27:42) service, but also much better leverage.

Devin Ryan Q

Good. I'll ask another one on the advisory cash rates. Sounds like some of what's going on in the industry is news
to you guys as well as you're following along. And so, I guess just what I'd love to know, if you can, like what
percentage of fee-based accounts is in cash at kind of the lowest rates? And then, just also trying to understand
competitive reasons that could drive kind of a change in your thinking because, obviously, one of the firms that's
moved made their changes in April, which I'm assuming you guys probably reevaluate frequently [indiscernible]
(00:28:37) that then. So just try to think about what else could competitively change your view, especially now that
the vast majority, if not all, of the yield-seeking cash has already been moved on to those higher yielding
alternatives for customers, as advisors should have already done?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Yes. So, if you look at our advisory suites, we'll just focus on those. It's about 2.5% of those assets are in cash.
And so, that's frictional cash. You can't find an institutional portfolio or anyone that doesn't have some cash in it at
those levels for trading, for paying fees, for whatever you do in them. So we view that as frictional or spend in
cash. The average cash amount in those accounts are $8,900. I mean, so, I don't know whether to go to a bank
and get kind of our sweep rates at that amount of cash.
So, the other thing, if you looked at those accounts and you can tell the shift because before rates started moving,
it was just cash in those accounts. Total money market CDs and treasuries are 22,600 for those accounts – I'm
sorry, money markets, CDs, treasuries, combined there's 22,600 in account, so you can see it's much more
invested certainly on higher yield instruments. So we believe that at $8,900, it's 2.5%. That's a very low rate of
cash to have sitting for transactions. So we think we're putting clients money to work with those numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Right. Exactly. So, I guess, that's kind of my, I guess, the root of the question that you've already seen that move,
it's a very small amount. You are playing a higher rate than some other programs, as you mentioned already. So,
competitively, from here, and we don't know exactly every reaction that's happened, but just the the catalyst to
actually make meaningful change after you are already in the position that you're in as you just described, Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the forces that could be happening, if there was the squeeze on cash in the industry, where would you get
the cash, you would offer higher rates to get it out of treasuries and money market funds and whatever. I think
that cash does seem to have stabilized pretty much everywhere, starting to anyway. Who knows where that goes.
We have a very clear buffer still for operating our business. But I think a demand for cash or if rates go up, you
start to see that would pressure it, but if rates go down and there's plenty of cash, I don't see what really
squeezes that outside of following the market, as you know, as rates fall. So I don't see anything else, barring
some unusual thing in the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Paul. And then, just a quick follow-up on the loan growth. Really nice to see
the, I guess, securities-based loan demand that you guys referenced. And just curious if that's something that, just
as you're kind of maybe seeing a shift in appetite and people's comfort with where rates are, if that's something
that you would expect would continue? Can that continue to fuel loan growth, I guess, is the root of the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Devin. Paul Shoukry here. We have the securities-based loan growth during the quarter, as you point out,
was really nice to see. And I think it was due to, one, payoffs and paydowns really decelerating since rates started
rising, that was a big drag on loan growth in the SBL portfolio. So that has subsided. And also in borrowers and
clients getting used to the new levels of rates, so that's also been – they're tapping into their lines and borrowing
more from their SBL. So we're now cautiously optimistic that that trend could continue going forward. And long
term, as you know, we're very bullish on the prospects for growth in securities-based loans. We think it's a very
attractive product for clients. And we knew that there'd be some headwinds as rapidly as rates have risen, that
there'd be some headwinds as clients get used to the higher level of rates. But going forward, we're growing more
optimistic that we'll continue seeing growth in that portfolio.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good evening, Paul and Paul. So [indiscernible] (00:33:36) this is a bit of a nitty-gritty question, just on the
same topic of advisory suite. One, there's been some speculation that at least one wirehouse peer may have
received some regulatory scrutiny of cash disclosure if it's disclosed in the filings. So, we and others are
admittedly scrutinizing some of these cash disclosures much more closely. Your disclosures note that Raymond
James shares a portion of the revenue from sweep options with the advisor. So, admittedly, your firm with a
longstanding reputation for putting clients first, but as conflicts are scrutinized more closely, is there a concern
that the method for which advisors are compensated does create some inherent conflict? And how should we
think about that in terms of the go-forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, that's a great question. And let me explain the disclosure first. So, on advisory accounts, cash has no different
payment in terms of the advisor than any other asset class. So, if they have $1 million account and they're
charging 1%, they're getting $10,000 in fees. If there's zero cash, they're getting $10,000 in fees. If there's 5%
cash, they're getting $10,000 in fees. There is no indirect incentives on trips or rewards or points or anything.
There is zero incentive in advisory account to do anything but what's in the best interest of your client. And I
assure you, there's nothing from home office that you can ask about it. We've been known and continue to, the
advisor should be doing the right things for their clients. And, of course, we have supervision, making sure it
doesn't go the other way. But we have a great group of advisors; and by the movements, they're doing what they
should be doing.
The disclosure really talks about some limited things and the brokerage side. And let me explain that one, that
we've had some fund raising programs like the ESP program, where for high rate, money market types of rates
that we've allowed advisors to be compensated in those programs, they are not compensated a penny on the
sweeps. So the only incentive that they have is to go – is to put clients for compensation in the higher rate
accounts. They have zero compensation on below rate accounts. So, brokerages be like dropping a ticket into
some of their investment as they put it into those high rate accounts. They're doing the right thing for clients. It
costs us more money. So we don't believe there's any conflict whatsoever. But the fact that we've done that in
limited cases, we put that disclosure in, to cover that, and regulatory wise, they like it very clear that you – you
said that you could pay, that you are paying, but it's been a very a nuanced circumstance. But again, it's all for the
very high rate types of programs.

No, that's really helpful. Very fulsome response, Paul. So, thank you. One point I just wanted to clarify because
you specifically mentioned it's not part of the advisor program, which is consistent with what we saw too, but it
also notes that you don't share comp directly with the financial advisor, but the aggregate amount of cash gets
credited to the overall payout rate and can cause your FA to receive higher comp on transactions and other
unrelated activities. It's vague. I don't know what those activities could be, but if you could provide some context
around that as well, just given the focus on this issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. When you're looking at the focus on cash, that's the only thing I can imagine, that's the only thing where
there's compensation at all for cash directly or indirectly, it's just on that very small investment vehicles like ESP
that we put into brokerage, and that's it. I mean, there is no other. Advisors have opportunities on asset growth
and net new assets, but has nothing to do with cash. I mean, they bring in net new assets. We have a net new
asset, a program that can benefit advisors. But it's nothing – it's not centered on cash.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

All right. Understood. That's very helpful color. If I could just squeeze in one more quickly. Just, Paul Shoukry, on
the flat spread revenue guide, was a bit better than we had anticipated. That's certainly nice to hear. I was hoping
you could unpack some of the factors to support the flat spread revenue quarter-on-quarter, just given there's
been some upward pressure on funding costs, tailwind of [ph] sorting (00:38:42), but still some incremental [ph]
sorting (00:38:44), however modest. I was hoping you could provide some context on what some of the key
assumptions are underpinning that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, kind of offsetting some of the funding cost pressures that you've describing there is a loan growth that
we experienced throughout the quarter and the continued asset growth that we would hope to experience going
forward. So that's, we said, flat or maybe down nominally, but that's what's driving that guidance.

I think we're – are we digesting? Sure. And we're watching, but I mean, I don't – again, we don't anticipate
anything. As you learn things, you might make tweaks here or there, but we're just going to have to see what
plays out as what we know today, but we'll talk about it at our next cash [ph] bidding (00:40:10). But we have no

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. And then, just in terms of the backlog around recruiting, you mentioned record backlog of large
teams. That's a comment I think you've been making for several quarters. So, just curious if there's additional
context thinking – given the strong net new assets in the quarter, the funding, kind of bring onboarding that you're
seeing versus the replenishment of that backlog? If there's any other additional color, it would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We've been – the recruiting is actually backlog, has been picking up. It's extremely strong. As I said, the
last few quarters, we're not surprised by it anymore, but we were surprised the large number of $5 million, $10
million, even $20 million teams, it's continuing. And we continue to get new ones, both joining committed and in
the pipeline that I think we're competing very, very well for. So the recruiting activity remains strong, and we're still
very optimistic on it. And I think we're – we don't see anything right now that's slowing down the pace. So that's
been really good news for us.

Let me – what we could say is that within fee based, all fee-based accounts, we have about $15 billion of cash
sweep balances and that excludes the custody business. And then, within that, to Paul's point, it's very – there's
some risk of fiduciary, there's some other types of programs within that. But that's all fee-based accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And some of those are firm [indiscernible] (00:43:04), some of them are advisors with discretion, and
there's some with advisors without discretion where they have to clear everything with the client. So, they – so but
that's the total number if you looked at it.

Yeah. Yeah. And again, [ph] almost (00:43:25) the average on those accounts is $8,900 and 2.5%. So, it's not –
it's really the residual cash residing on average in those sweeps...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. Maybe a question on the third-party bank sweep yield falling by 18 basis points sequentially
and about 25 basis points over the last two quarters. Just wondering if you could clarify if there any changes
made to rates or tiers that partially drove that and also clarify what's driving this in terms of mix shift towards the
higher yield sweep offerings? Is that simply a shift of cash towards higher balance tiers or is there something else
driving the negative mix shift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Kyle. Yeah, a lot of that is initiatives that we run where we offer kind of a higher rate for new cash that comes
into the sweep program to the firm and/or maturities from money market funds, treasuries, and those type of
things where clients want the functionality of the sweep program but want a comparable rate to move over and
benefit from the FDIC insurance and the availability of the cash in the sweep program. So, as we've kind of
implemented those initiatives, we've been able to effectively bring over cash from those sources through the
quarter, which while it increases the average cost of the funding, it increases also the amount of funding that we
have and it's net – still net attractive. So, it's really a win-win-win initiative that we've put into place in the sweep
programs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Is there any way to quantify the percentage of those third-party sweeps that are in the newer high yield or
the money market fund kind of equivalent yield program or?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think, now it's roughly somewhere in the 15% to 20% range of the total sweep balances that are in those type of
programs.

Understood. Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up just on repurchases. You mentioned your desire to
increase the pace of repurchases from here. You executed on about $240 million of repurchases in the prior
quarter. Should we think about that ramping to $300 million or $350 million? Any way you can quantify the
increase in that pace moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We're not programmatic, so we don't – we're not going to give you a hard number, a lot of factors play into it in
terms of the sources and uses of cash and capital. But, yeah, we definitely intend on increasing the pace from
$243 million, which I know was higher than many people expected even during the – this past quarter. So – but
we have lots of capital, lots of cash, and we remain committed to keeping that within our targets over a
reasonable period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. As we've said, if we couldn't find the – we're still looking at M&A activities, it's our preferred. But if we
couldn't find it, we'd return it. And we haven't been able to find them yet. So, we're going to start being more
aggressive on returning the capital ratios back where we think they should be.

William Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thank you very much taking the question. I do want to pick up on that last question. So, either of you
Pauls, and thank you both. Just in terms of the commentary of reallocating maybe to a bit more buyback. Is the
deal pipeline at a strategic level? Is it just less fulsome? Is it just hard to make the economics work? Is anything
shifting in the backdrop here that sort of pushes out that opportunity? And relatedly, if a deal were to come back,
would you then forego or truncate the underlying buyback? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the – very active, there's reasonable opportunities. Some are pricey, but for us, it's the right culture fit and
integration. And frankly, we're as you can see by this quarter, in the last few earnings are very, very strong. So,
those capital ratio [ph] tweaks (00:49:01) up, we want to get it back in a proper range. So we think we can still be
a lot more aggressive on the buybacks and still have ample capital if something happens. So it's just saying and
we don't expect anything of a size that there's no reason not to be more aggressive on returning it to you – to
shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Katz Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
[indiscernible] (00:49:37) Great. Terrific. And then sort of second question, going back to your outlook for the
stable NII and cash sweep dynamics, how should we think about any residual adverse mix shift into some of
these higher fee products? And is there any leakage here that existing customers, they're not necessarily bringing
new money in, but we'll look at that and say, hey, why can't I get that kind of rate and sort of put a little more
downward pressure on the net yield? And maybe the other way I like to ask the question is [indiscernible]
(00:50:12) so much, but what is now the net rate the client is ultimately getting here on the cash sweep? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, we offer – our grid starts, as Paul said, from 25 basis points goes all the way up to 3% on the cash
sweep program. And there has been some migration and mix shift to the higher yielding programs and initiatives
that we've offered, which are actually closer to 5%. And so, what all of this is happening, what hasn't really been
there for the us or the industry is loan growth, and that's actually impacted our capital ratios as well because our
earnings have been very strong. But the loan growth across the industry has been muted. So that's ultimately the
driver of both NIM, and more importantly net interest income, which actually impacts the bottom line, will be driven
by loan growth, which will drive higher yields and higher earnings overall. And so, that's kind of what we're as an
industry waiting for. We started seeing some improvement on the SBL side and we're optimistic that with more
corporate activity, we'll start seeing more activity on the corporate side eventually as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
It'll largely depend on the competitive environment. But because we have been generous in passing rates to
clients and through these other programs that have near money market fund rates like Enhanced Savings
Program, et cetera, that we should have a lot of sensitivity to the downside as well on the both the asset and on
the funding side of things. So, yeah, we do feel like we have an ample amount of cushion, but again it'll depend
on the competitive environment and the demand for cash across the industry as rates go down.

If you're in a sweep – if you have a sweep program, its 1 basis point to 50 basis points, you got a 50 basis point

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. So, Paul, when you think about next year and we think about the forward curve on Fed funds kind of a
gradual, say, 150 bps, it seems like you guys might hold up a little bit better, especially if loan growth picks up and
you still have some repricing in the securities portfolio, right, because the yields are still pretty low there. You put
all that together, do you have – I mean, I know there's competitive pricing, but do you feel like you guys can hold
in there pretty well next year on NII?

Jim Mitchell Q

Right. Fair enough.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We've generated record results now for the last three years and three quarters, and those were in very
different interest rate environments. And so, we are confident in our ability to perform very well in any kind of
interest rate environment because we have diversified and complementary businesses. So, for example, lower
interest rates, at least in the last cycle, certainly supported our M&A business and our fixed income business and
supported loan growth. We had record securities based loan growth during the COVID period because partly due
to the lower rates. So, there's different things that benefit us in different rate environments. But to your point on a
relative basis, because we have been so generous and passing on the rates to our clients and offering these
other programs, we feel like we're relatively well-positioned on that front as well.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I guess there's so many ways, it's hard to tell, right. And a big source of growth and income used to be –
can be one fees and other things and they've become less of a factor over time. Certainly, asset-based fees, if
you look at [ph] RIA's (00:55:39) and how they price versus the broker dealers, asset-based pricing is becoming
more common. There's all sorts of ways, and part of that depends on regulatory. You could have performance
fees, you could have – I think it's hard to tell where it evolves.
I think in the business, I don't – people talked about consulting fees or hourly rates, I don't think anyone likes a
lawyer or accountants go on [indiscernible] (00:56:08) hours. So, I don't think I will go there, especially given the
value of the relationship with an advisor where they – it's very – it's – everyone always thinks about the
investment part, that is part of it. But a lot of it is really the advise – the family advisors and they become a big part
of the lives of clients. So, there's all sorts of stuff that they change anyway over time, maybe it'll get more asset
based. We certainly have countries that the – UK, Australia where it's just direct charges, the clients have to be in
fee. So, it's very clear. [ph] Could have ball roll (00:56:43) sorts of ways, but it's a very competitive, mature
industry and I think that people will find a way to adjust. We've had to adjust through zero interest rates and high
interest rates, and all sorts of things, and we've kind of adjust that as we've gone along. So, 10 years out in our
industry seems like forever, maybe it's because I'm old and Paul has to worry about it, but.

Michael J. Cyprys Q

Great. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up question more broadly on cash sorting and cash sweep balances, just
curious how close do you think we are to bottom and eventually starting to see that grow again? What catalyst do
you see on Horizon that might get us there and how might the recent evolving competitive backdrop and industry
discussions here and debates on the sweep rate, how might that impact cash sweep balances just given the
heightened focus and attention that it's getting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Shoukry A
President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we continue to believe that we're closer to the end of the sorting cycle than the beginning. And
some of the metrics that Paul discussed just in the fee-based accounts having $8,900 of cash per – cash sweeps
per account, whereas we have $22,600 of money market funds, CDs and treasuries. A lot of these clients, to the
extent they had investable cash balances, have been invested in the higher yielding alternatives. We're not – as
we've always said since the very beginning, and we're one of the first, if not the first to say it, we're not going to
declare the end of the trend until we have several quarters of history to look back on and start seeing growth in
the cash balances.
And ultimately, that growth will come from the stabilization of the runoff and the migration and the growth of – the
continued growth, which we've had phenomenal growth of client assets, there'll be cash associated with that, and
that ultimately will drive the growth in the balances.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, appreciate all the detail. And obviously, it's a
dynamic backdrop, so we're all kind of navigating and learning from it. So, appreciate that there's still a ton of
unknowns there. But I guess as you think about that $15 billion sweep number that you provided, and I think most
of us understand that it is fairly small and it and it's largely operational. But I guess at the heart of the question,
what we're all kind of trying to figure out is why is transactional or operational cash, albeit small, on a per account
basis, but is still part of the advisory relationship, would be treated differently under the fiduciary standard of Reg
BI, and why wouldn't that cash balance, again, albeit small, still receive sort of some of the higher yields that are
available out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, I guess, my quick answer would be, what do you get on your checking account, right? There's a cost to
having it on the platform. There's a cost to servicing it, it's transactional, so it has more transactions. So there is a
cost. I mean, it is the standard for BI is you have to pay a rate that way on the economic to operate a business. I
don't know what that means, and I don't think that is the standard under BI, but clients first and be fair and take
their interests at heart first. And I think that transactional cash, 25 basis points is a lot more than you're going to
get on your checking account. Very reasonable. So, I mean, there may be disagreements. I think a standard like
that is I wouldn't understand how you could come up with that. So it's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I guess the difference is like the checking account is not a fiduciary relationship versus this seems to be one. And
I guess that's where the disconnect comes in and what could be the outcome of all of this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
There are a lot of fiduciary accounts. I agree with that. You look at institutional asset managers, they have a
fiduciary relationship, but they don't have zero cash in their portfolios. So, I mean – so if you want to benchmark it
to other fiduciary relationships of this type of investments, it would be a real outlier to say, all that cash has to be
100% invested because it's not reality the way accounts work, that would say we have to not only sort the costs,
so we'd have to fund the transactions because it wouldn't be cash in the account or sell out securities in order to
fund these transactions or other things. I mean, I just I think that – to me, that's not a reasonable standard.

Got you. All right. Understood. All right. My quick follow-up, Paul, the old Paul, back to the discussion around
third-party bank sweep and the rate changes and the migration that you've seen there. Do you expect that to be
largely done or there could be still some mix shift where some of the larger account balances will kind of push that
yield a little bit lower? And to what extent, I guess, is that, if at all, incorporated in your sort of flattish cash
revenue trajectory for next quarter versus this quarter?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Yeah. Well, we have – I mean, the initiative itself, we have some levers on around largely rate, right. So to the
extent that we want to continue bringing in cash from the outside, rate is a big lever. We actually just announced
that we're reducing the rate on the high yield portion of the program that brings in the new cash from the outside
because we have a pretty big buffers now with over $17 billion of cash swept up third-party banks that we can
reposition and bring on to fund our own bank over time.
So it really just depends on how much of the initiative that we want continue to pull in that we actually, again, just
announced that we're reducing the rate. It's still very attractive, higher than 5%. But you we're not going to, again,
declare completion of any type of trend until we have several quarters of history. Otherwise, it's just speculation.
