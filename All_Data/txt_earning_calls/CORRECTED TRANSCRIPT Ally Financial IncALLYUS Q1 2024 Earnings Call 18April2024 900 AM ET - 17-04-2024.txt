Douglas Timmerman
Interim Chief Executive Officer & President-Dealer Financial Services, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'll start on page 4. Before we get
into the quarter, I want to comment on our CEO transition. As we announced last month, Michael Rhodes will be
taking over as CEO on April 29. I've been fortunate to spend time with Michael throughout the process and I'm
certain he is the right person to lead. Ally. He respects our results and his deep banking experience make him a
natural fit to continue advancing Ally's businesses. On behalf of myself and the entire leadership team, we are
thrilled to welcome Michael to Ally in a few weeks.
I'd also like to say it's been an absolute privilege for me to serve as the interim CEO these past few months. I've
been with Ally for over 30 years and the things that have always energized me the most are our people and
culture. At Ally, the culture runs deep and it revolves around our employees, customers and communities. It starts
and stops with our 11,000 associates. And very importantly to my teammates, thank you for your support, hard
work and dedication, and of course, caring for our customers. I firmly believe when you take care of your people
they take care of everything else, including our customers and communities.
In the first quarter, we were once again named on Fortune 100's Best Companies to Work For. For us, it's never
about awards, but it's an achievement that we can be proud of. What I'm most proud of are the employee survey
results. 89% of employees said Ally is a great place to work. 93% of employees felt good about the way Ally
contributes to the community. And the stat that most resonated with me was that more than 90% of employees
were proud to tell others they are part of Ally. Creating an engaged workforce that embraces our do it right
approach is essential to our business and our growing customer base. And as we continue to navigate a fluid
environment, we'll continue to lean in our culture and lead core values to guide our actions.
With that, let's turn to page number 5 and get into the results. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 and revenue of
$2 billion reflect solid operational execution as our teammates remain focused on priorities that are big enough to
matter and drive solid returns. Net interest margin of 3.16% was again pressured by rising rates. However, we've
now reached an inflection point and expect NIM expansion beginning in the second quarter.
Before discussing operational results, I want to hit a few notable items in the first quarter. In March, we
successfully closed on the sale of Ally Lending, which generated capital allows us to better serve our dealer and
consumer customers. We also tapped the securitization market to deconsolidate retail auto loans from the
balance sheet, which created incremental capital and generated a nice earnings benefit within the period. Strong
investor interest and the earnings benefit created by this transaction are another validation the loans we originate
have attractive returns. And finally, we recognized an incremental $10 million of expense from a revised FDIC
special assessment, which is not included in core results.
Moving to operational results in dealer financial services. Within auto, we decisioned as record 3.8 million
applications and booked nearly $10 billion of originations. Retail auto originations had an average yield of
10.92%, while 40% of originations came from our highest quality credit tier. First quarter net charge-offs of retail
auto were 227 basis points, in line with the guidance we gave about a month ago. Insurance earned premiums of
$349 million were also a record. And we see continued momentum as we grow OEM partnerships and continue
leveraging our expansive auto finance dealer network.
Turning to Ally Bank, deposits continue to be a source of strength for Ally. We grew deposits $2.9 billion in the
quarter while adding more than 100,000 customers. Our deposit franchise was established 15 years ago and now
serves more than 3 million customers, provides stable and efficient funding, and makes Ally a structurally more
profitable company. Ally Credit Card is performing in line with expectations. As we've mentioned, losses will be

elevated near term. However, we remain encouraged by its long-term compelling return profile. Corporate
Finance continues to drive strong financial results, and next month we'll celebrate its 25th anniversary. The
business generated a 31% ROE in the first quarter, and our $10 billion portfolio remains historically strong from a
credit standpoint.
Let's turn to page number 6 to talk about Ally's market-leading franchises. Last week marked 10 years of being a
publicly traded company, and the transformation since that time has been remarkable. What began as an auto
finance captive is now made up of two market-leading franchises: a dealer-centric and diversified auto finance
provider; and the largest, all-digital, direct US bank with more than 3 million customers and $145 billion of retail
deposits.
Our dealer financial services platform revolves around the dealer, deepening those relationships and providing a
comprehensive value proposition to help grow their businesses. We have continued to evolve the business to find
new ways to help our dealer customers while also optimizing risk adjusted returns for Ally. Over the past 10 years,
Ally Bank has built on its reputation as the leading innovative digital bank. We pride ourselves on providing best-
in-class customer experiences and a strong value proposition that extends beyond rates. And our deposits
franchise has been the key driver for customer acquisition and engagement.
We have expanded our products and features to deepen customer relationships, including Ally Home and Ally
Invest. And credit card and Corporate Finance are businesses that diversify revenue and improve our
consolidated profitability. Both dealer financial services and Ally Bank have scale, lead in their respective markets,
and position Ally for profitable growth in the years ahead.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Russ to cover detailed financial results.

Russell E. Hutchinson
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 7. In the first quarter, net financing revenue,
excluding OID of $1.5 billion, is down versus prior periods, driven by higher funding cost, partially offset by strong
originated yields. The increasing funding costs have been a persistent headwind since the tightening cycle began,
but we've reached an inflection point as rates have stabilized. Continued strength in originated yields in the auto
business has positioned the balance sheet for NIM expansion beginning in the second quarter. We'll discuss
asset and liability dynamics that are driving our NIM expansion in a few slides.
Adjusted other revenue of $519 million is up from prior periods, driven by continued momentum in diversified fee
revenue, including insurance, as higher vehicle inventory balances drove higher earned premiums. We continue
to see expanding other revenue driven by strengthen in insurance and fee revenue streams in auto, including our
SmartAuction and Passthrough program. Insurance, SmartAuction and our Passthrough programs are highly
valued by our dealers, and they drive capital-efficient revenue for Ally.
Provision expense of $507 million increased from prior year and was down on a linked quarter basis. Credit
performance in the quarter was in line with expectations. Retail auto NCOs came in around the middle of our
guide that we provided at the conference last month. Losses within the quarter were impacted by softer used
values throughout much of the quarter, but we did see stability in March and are exiting the first quarter flat versus
December. I'll cover retail auto credit in more detail shortly.
As Doug mentioned, we executed another loan sale via the securitization market, which drove a $15 million
earnings benefit in the quarter that was realized through the provision expense line. We deconsolidated $1.1

billion of retail auto loans originated predominantly in 2023, with yields below our average originated yield for the
year. Investors' strong interest in our loans and the $15 million earnings benefit we realized demonstrate the
attractive return profile in a dynamic environment.
Adjusted non-interest expense of $1.3 billion was up year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in the
insurance business. Controllable expenses, which exclude insurance losses, commission and FDIC fees, were
down 1% year-over-year. Tax expense of $14 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 8%, which is lower than
our guide as we continue to benefit from strong EV lease originations. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter
were $0.42 and $0.45, respectively.
Moving to slide 8, net interest margin, excluding OID of 3.16%, decreased 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter and
was slightly above the high end of guidance we provided at an investor conference last month. Earning asset
yields expanded modestly quarter-over-quarter, while funding cost increased by 9 basis points. As I mentioned
earlier, margin has been pressured by increasing funding cost throughout the tightening cycle. But we've
positioned the balance sheet for NIM expansion from here.
Strength in fixed rate asset pricing, particularly retail auto loans with originated yield at 10.9%, will continue to
drive earning asset yield higher as that portfolio naturally turns over. We expect earning assets to be flat over the
medium term, but favorable mix dynamics will continue to drive asset yields higher as lower yielding mortgages
and securities are replaced by higher yielding auto, Corporate Finance and credit card loans.
Turning to liabilities, cost of funds moved upwards in the quarter, driven primarily by higher deposit costs. We
moved our OSA rate in mid-December, so our 1Q results reflect a full quarter at the peak rate. And we continued
to see CD portfolio yields move slightly higher as expected. Within the quarter, we took meaningful actions to
reduce deposit pricing across CDs and our $100-billion liquid savings portfolio. We've been delighted with the
trends we've seen in deposits, which enabled us to move meaningfully well in advance of Fed rate cuts. Strength
in retail auto yields, favorable asset mix, and now having moved past the peak in retail deposit costs, we are
confident in NIM expansion starting in the second quarter.
Let's turn to page 9 and talk about the auto franchise. Our model is simple. We help our dealers sell as many cars
and trucks as possible and encourage our dealers to send us all of their application volume. We leverage our
differentiated go-to-market approach, coupling high tech and high touch to earn their partnership. 22,000 dealer
partners delivered 13.8 million applications last year, and that momentum has continued in 2024.
This quarter, we saw 3.8 million applications, our best quarter ever, and resulted in $9.8 billion of consumer
volume within the quarter. Strength in application flow enabled us to be dynamic in what we originate. We shifted
our credit mix in April of 2023, and since that time, more than 40% of our originations have been in our highest
credit tier. We've now originated over 10% yields for five consecutive quarters. That creates momentum, which I'll
cover on the next page.
Let's turn to slide 10 to discuss retail auto portfolio yields in more detail. The current yield on a total retail auto
portfolio is just over 9%. While we continue to originate loans at close to 11% each quarter, as older vintages
mature and are replaced with new origination, the portfolio yield will continue to migrate higher. Given the natural
liability sensitive nature of our balance sheet, we've consistently utilized pay fix hedges tied to retail auto loans to
reduce exposure to rising rates. These hedges are serving as an effective bridge while our retail auto loan
portfolio is repricing higher over time.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
We manage the hedge position dynamically, but currently expect it to amortize down over time, which means its
contribution to NIM will continue to decline. The natural repricing momentum created by strong originated yields
will continue to outpace a declining hedge contribution, resulting in a total portfolio yield that we expect to
increase to 9.5% by year end and continue to migrate towards originated yield over time. This momentum,
coupled with deposit costs that have peaked position Ally for NIM expansion without the benefit of Fed rate cuts.
The other dynamic influencing portfolio yield is origination mix. As we covered on the prior slide, we are
consistently originating more than 40% of our consumer volume in our highest credit tier. Historically, that tier has
accounted for just under 30% of total originations. Over time, we do expect to migrate closer to our historical
origination mix. For context, a shift to our historical mix would add up to 100 basis points of originated yield today.
With 10.9% yields on originations that skew heavily towards our assets here, we are pleased with the risk
adjusted yields we're getting today and are not assuming any significant shift over the next few quarters. But over
time, we would anticipate a gradual migration closer to historical mix, which provides yet another yield tailwind
going forward that will help offset an eventual decline in benchmark rates.
Let's move to slide 11 to talk about the strength of the deposits franchise. Ally Bank was launched 15 years ago
and has evolved into the largest all-digital direct bank in the US, serving more than 3 million customers. We have
been intentional about creating a comprehensive value proposition that goes beyond consistently competitive
rates. We offer best-in-class customer service and digital experiences and over time, added features and
products that are important for our customers, including Ally Invest, Home, and Credit Card. And we continue to
serve as relentless allies to our customers with high levels of service through online, mobile, text and telephone,
as well as the consumer friendly approach to fees, including leading the way on overdraft elimination.
This approach has led to 95% plus customer retention rates, 90% plus satisfaction scores, favorable NPS, and
strong balance trend across every vintage since the inception of the bank. And while we do not focus on
accolades, we do think the countless awards received over the last 15 years validates the strength of the brand
and the bank. The 15-year journey led to exceptionally strong performance over the tightening cycle and puts Ally
in a position of strength moving forward. We have consistently grown deposits and seen record customer
acquisition without being a top payer since the Fed began tightening.
As we sit today, we're core funded with 90% of our liability stack in the form deposits, and we expect earning
assets to be relatively flat over the next few years, which results in less need for significant deposit growth going
forward. The combination of a great brand and comprehensive value proposition enabled us to lag competition
from a pricing perspective on the way up and positions us to lead on the way down.
We took significant pricing actions in the quarter while maintaining our commitment to offering our customers
attractive deposit rates and a compelling overall experience. We reduced rates 75 basis points on our most
popular CD term, 15 basis points on our money market account, and 10 basis points on our $84-billion savings
product. In terms of deposit flows, we saw nearly $3 billion of growth within the quarter while adding more than
100,000 customers.
Growth within the quarter was favorable to our expectations and positions us well for a seasonal tax outflow in the
second quarter. We expect deposit balances to decline in 2Q as we typically see outflows from existing customers
related to tax payments. Given outperformance in 1Q and our fully funded flat balance sheet, we're not expecting
to drive growth to offset seasonal taxes like we have in prior years. We do expect growth on a full year basis but
less than what we delivered in 2023.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Turning to page 12. CET1 of 9.4% increased quarter-over-quarter. At current levels, we exceed our 7% regulatory
CET1 operating minimum by $3.8 billion. We recently submitted our capital plan as we are scoped into CCAR for
2024 and we'll get an updated view of our SCB later this year. Within the quarter, we closed on the sale of Ally
Lending, generating a 15-basis point CET1 benefit, and executed another retail auto loan sale generating 6 basis
points of CET1. The loan sale reflected strong investor interest in our loans and drove a $15-million pre-tax
earnings benefit for operating capital and generating servicing income going forward.
We phased in another quarter of the capital impact from the transition to CECL, which was worth 18 basis points
in the quarter, which was more than offset by the sale of Ally Lending and the retail auto loan sale. One more
phase-in remain with total impact fully phased in by 1Q 2025. We recently announced our quarterly dividend of
$0.30, which remains flat to prior quarter. We remain committed to acting on attractive opportunities to create
excess capital to invest in our highest returning businesses and driving tangible book value per share growth over
time.
Let's turn to slide 13 to review asset quality trends. The consolidated net charge-off rate of 155 basis points
reflects performance in line with expectations. Net charge-offs were down quarter-over-quarter as discrete losses
in Corporate Finance and commercial auto in the prior period did not repeat. Retail auto net charge-offs of 227
basis points were in line with expectations. In the bottom right, 30 and 60-day retail auto loan delinquencies reflect
seasonal trends. The year-over-year increase in 30-day delinquencies has moderated for the fifth consecutive
quarter and give us confidence that delinquencies are at or near peak on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Moving to slide 14, consolidated coverage remained steady at 2.57%. Retail auto coverage of 3.65% was
unchanged from the prior quarter, while our allowance was down $32 million driven by lower balances. We
maintain robust retail auto coverage levels at 10% above CECL day one, partly driven by portfolio mix as we've
shifted into more profitable volume over time. Assuming macro variables remain consistent, we're not anticipating
much change in the retail auto coverage rate over the medium term.
While the retail auto coverage rate is well above CECL day one levels, our mid-teens ROE guidance does not
assume any reductions in coverage from here. As a reminder, our CECL reserving process is a 12-month
reasonable and supportable forecast, which assumes unemployment increasing to 4.1% later this year. And we
assume gradual reversion to 6% unemployment from months 12 through 36.
Let's turn to slide 15 to discuss retail auto credit in more detail. First quarter NCOs were consistent with the
preview we gave at a recent investor conference. And we saw another quarter of declining year-over-year
increase in total portfolio delinquency as shown in the bottom left chart. Losses for the first half of this year will be
elevated as the 2022 vintage, which is producing losses above price expectations, works through its peak loss
period. That vintage is at its peak loss period today and accounted for more than 40% of losses recorded in the
first quarter. As we move throughout the year, portfolio losses will be increasingly driven by more recent vintages,
which continue to show favorable loss in delinquency trends relative to the 2022 vintage.
Similar to last quarter, we've shown a comparison of delinquency trends for the 2022 and 2023 vintages on the
bottom of the page. After 15 months on book, the 2023 vintage delinquency rate is now 28 basis points below
where the 2022 vintage was at the same point of time. Excluding the impact of recent loan sales, which skew
towards high credit quality loans, the gap is 34 basis points. That gap has widened since our last earnings call,
which showed the 2023 vintage 22 basis points favorable at 12 months on book.
I also want to point out this particular comparison after 15 months on book is impacted by where the last day of
the month fell. The final calendar day of 1Q 2023 was a Friday, which is typically our strongest day of cash

collection, as it lines up with the pay periods for many consumers. In 2024, the final calendar day fell not only on a
Sunday, but also a holiday. As a result, the spot delinquency rate for the 2023 vintage after 15 months was
elevated. As we move into the first few days of April, the gap between 2022 and 2023 vintages widened further.
So we remain confident 2023 and 2024 vintages will perform favorably to the 2022 vintage that is driving higher
losses today.
In addition to delinquency and loss frequency trends, we continue to closely monitor the impact of used values on
loss severity. Values were weaker for much of the quarter, which drove 1Q losses slightly higher than
expectations. But we saw a nice rebound in March, which has persisted through the first half of April. Used
vehicle values have since rebounded and are now flat to year end as we begin the second quarter. Used vehicle
values have been choppy. However, we continue to expect the Ally Use Index to settle out around 120 by the end
of the year, which would imply a 5% to 6% decline from where we are today.
Based on 1Q actuals and elevated loss content from the 2022 vintage, our estimate of losses is up marginally
versus January to approximately 2% for the year. Importantly, we remain pleased with the impact of curtailments
over the past 12 months and performance trends on recent vintages.
Let's turn to slide 16 to review auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of $322 million was lower year-over-year,
driven by higher provision expense and non-interest expense. Provision reflected elevated net charge-off
performance compared to the prior-year period. Non-interest expense is up year-over-year as we navigate a
period of elevated loss content, driving higher servicing costs. Other revenue of $97 million is up $20 million year-
over-year, as we continue to focus on diversifying revenue with fee income.
Our SmartAuction and Passthrough platforms are great examples of how we help serve our dealers while also
generating capital-efficient revenue. SmartAuction enables dealer to dealer transactions, generating fee revenue
while providing real-time data on market pricing and trends. Despite pressure on industry volume, SmartAuction
grew revenue by 60% between 2019 and 2023. Through white-label relationships, we see more opportunity to
grow this business and deliver incremental fee revenue while strengthening our dealer value proposition.
With a focus on increasing application volume, our Passthrough program is yet another way for us to deliver
enhanced value to our dealers. For certain loans that do not meet our underwriting criteria, we pass through those
applications to our partners. For loans that are ultimately funded by our partners, Ally receives an origination fee
and generate servicing revenue without using any capital. SmartAuction and Passthrough revenues are expected
to grow to $190 million in 2024, up 120% since 2019. Both products demonstrate the strength and scale we have
in the marketplace and are a win-win for Ally and the dealer. Lease portfolio trends are on the bottom right. Dealer
and lessee buyouts declined to 57%, but remain elevated compared to historical levels.
Turning to insurance results on slide 17. Core pre-tax income of $53 million included the highest quarterly
premium earned since our IPO. Insurance losses of $112 million are up $24 million year-over-year, driven
primarily by growth, including higher insured values and higher weather losses. We saw solid operating leverage
within the quarter as premiums earned increased by $40 million, while acquisition and underwriting expenses
were up modestly. Total written premium of $354 million increased 15% year-over-year as we see continued
success in expanding our all-in dealer value proposition.
We're seeing nice momentum related to conquest activity as we recently launched relationships with two major
OEMs, which will provide an immediate boost to written and earned premiums. Growth in insurance will naturally
increase our non-controllable expenses, specifically commissions and losses, but those are more than offset with
fee revenue. And importantly, we have a reinsurance program in place that reduces volatility from weather losses

across our P&C inventory exposure. As we look ahead, insurance remains integral to our dealer value proposition
and is the main driver of continued fee revenue growth.
Turning to Corporate Finance on slide 18. Pre-tax income of $90 million reflects solid financial performance. Net
financing revenue was up, driven by higher average balances and higher benchmarks as the entire portfolio was
floating rate. Our $10.1 billion HFI portfolio was well diversified and virtually all first lien. Balances are up
marginally year-over-year, but down linked quarter. Favorable capital markets conditions, including a strong CLO
market, led to elevated payoffs, particularly within our lender finance vertical.
From a credit standpoint, the portfolio is in fantastic shape with criticized assets and non-accrual loans at
historically low levels. Commercial real estate exposure makes up a little more than $1 billion and is entirely
related to the healthcare industry. With a track record of delivering strong returns, including 25% in 2023 and 31%
this quarter, we continue to be excited about the long-term trajectory of this business as we celebrate its 25th
anniversary.
Mortgage results are on slide 19. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $25 million and $233 million of direct-to-
consumer originations, reflective of the current environment and our predominantly variable cost structure. Our
held-for-investment assets continue to decrease quarter-over-quarter as loans mature, and we operate the
business on a primarily originate to sell basis.
Our mortgage HFI assets will continue to decrease as we remain disciplined in allocating capital to our highest
returning businesses and managing the duration of our balance sheet. Mortgage remains a complementary
product for our deposit customers who accounted for the majority of our originations in the quarter. We are
committed to providing a best-in-class customer experience and operational efficiency.
I'll touch on the 2024 outlook before we move into Q&A. We've been pleased with the execution of our business,
and our outlook for this year and beyond remains consistent. In terms of net interest margin, first quarter
represents a trough in NIM and we expect meaningful expansion from here, with or without a decrease in the Fed
funds rate. As I said before, we look at our outlook under a variety of rate scenarios and are not reliant on rate
cuts to get to an exit rate of 3.4% to 3.5% this year. And we are confident we will reach 4% NIM run rate in late
2025.
In terms of quarterly cadence, it won't be a straight line as things like lease terminations and gain do not – do
have some seasonality, but we expect 5 basis points to 15 basis points of NIM expansion per quarter for the rest
of the year. We are increasing our fee revenue guidance from up 5% to 10% to up 9% to 12%. We continue to
see momentum and growth in insurance and SmartAuction and the auto Passthrough offerings, which drive
durable revenues with minimal capital requirements.
In insurance specifically, we are seeing P&C exposure increase through higher dealer inventory levels and our
new business conquest, which immediately increases revenues. Continued expansion insurance is driving the
only change to our operating expense guide. Controllable expenses are still expected to be down 1%. But as
we've talked about in past, growth in P&C does add commission and loss expenses. So, total expenses are
expected to be up less than 2% year-over-year, which is up slightly from the original guide. Importantly, net
changes in insurance are immediately accretive to pre-tax earnings as the revenue will more than offset the
expenses. This is a trade we will take all day and that's the guidance we continue to give our insurance
teammates.

No change to the expected consolidated loss rate of 1.4% to 1.5%. And as I mentioned, we see retail NCOs
around 2%, up marginally from approximately 1.9% in January. The continued runoff of the 2022 vintage and the
favorable performance of the 2023 vintage is expected to drive a seasonally adjusted loss rate down later in the
year. And while structural supply and demand dynamics continue to give us confidence in the path of used
vehicles over the medium-term, volatility in the short-term will certainly impact our loss performance. We continue
to expect the balance sheet in total to be pretty flat for the foreseeable future, with favorable mix dynamics
contributing to NIM expansion.
On the tax rate, we've adjusted our full year guide to 15%, reflecting one quarter of actual and a rate of around
18% for the rest of the year. EV lease originations are the largest driver of the tax favorability we saw this quarter.
To the extent we continue to see strong momentum here, we may outperform that 15% guide for the year.
We remain confident that we are on a path to a run rate with 4% NIM, $6 of EPS, and mid-teens return. As we
have said before, the timing of Fed rate cuts will impact the timing of our expansion in 2025 but not the
destination. We will remain focused on executing on our scaled franchises, taking care of our associates and

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks. I guess, the question that seems to be the – there's such a strong origination yield and yet it feels
like you're letting – there's opportunity to do more. And so the question is, I guess, is that in fact the case? And
you did talk about the ability – the stuff that you're doing in your highest tiers versus the rest of the credit
spectrum, is there an opportunity to do more and perhaps sell those loans to keep your balance sheet flat as your
plan? Is that something that you're considering doing during 2024 or 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Moshe. Moshe, I agree with you. The competitive environment remains favorable to us.
Both the mix that we're getting with – continuing to get 40% in S-tier, as well as the strong originated yield that
we're seeing are both testament of that. And so, we agree with your sentiment on the competitive environment
and the opportunity set remaining rich for us.
As you know – as you're well aware, we're dealing in a capital constrained environment with the expectation of
regulations coming down the pipeline, all very manageable. And as you also pointed out, we've been – we've also
been opportunistic in terms of looking for opportunities to really leverage our dealer relationships and our balance
sheet. So, you saw us deconsolidate over the course of fourth quarter and this past quarter $2.7 billion of auto
loans through sales in the securitization market. Those transactions were well-received. We're seeing strong
appetite. You saw us take a $15-million earnings benefit this quarter on the sale of $1.1 billion of loans to the
securitization market. Again, testament to the attractiveness of our loans in the capital markets.
We will continue to look at opportunities like that and we will continue to look at whether it's deconsolidation
through securitization. We'll also look at credit risk transfer transactions as ways of freeing up RWA in order to
redeploy in the business. So, I think, we are in agreement with you and we continue to pursue opportunities
opportunistically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas Timmerman A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & President-Dealer Financial Services, Ally Financial, Inc.
I would just add what's unique and obviously, I've been doing this for a long time, 30 plus years. So, obviously,
competition often times softens during, call it, tougher credit environments. But today it's different. It's also
softening due to the fact that there's a change in regulatory environment coming out. So, everyone's seeing that
impact of the capital of what it is. So, from my view, the opportunity for us is actually going to last longer than what
you normally would see. So, we feel really good about the competitive environment, really good about our ability
to continue originating at a high level, and very importantly originate at high yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, the vintage performance that you discussed, is there a way to kind of
separate out how much of that is a result of kind of that better – more of your originations coming in the higher tier

pricing or just kind of fundamental better performance from borrowers that you originated in 2023? And can you
relate that to your comments about a flat reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, maybe I'll start and Doug can chip in here. But I would say – when we look at the performance of our book,
I would say delinquencies are elevated across the book, across vintage and across credit tiers. And we are
dealing with a customer that is struggling with inflation. All that being said, when we look at the difference
between the 2023 vintages versus 2022, I think what we're seeing in that improvement is the effect of curtailments
that we've been putting in place over time. And as you know, we've been kind of ratcheting up the level of
curtailment over the course of 2023.
So, we take a lot of confidence seeing that differentiation between the vintages and as you would expect, we look
at it a pretty granular level, looking at vintages on a monthly basis, on a quarterly basis and really kind of
analyzing and understanding the differences in their performance in terms of both delinquencies and also net
charge-off levels, which are also important. So, hopefully that addresses your question. But I think the
delinquency issue is one. The delinquency issue and the elevated credit that we're seeing is across all vintages
and across all credit tiers. But I think the main driver has been the level of curtailment that we've put in place over
the course of 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas Timmerman A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & President-Dealer Financial Services, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I agree. Obviously, it's two-pronged. It's curtailing those segments that are underperforming the most.
That's our opportunity to be able to move to a better quality mix, which gives that the benefit we have relative to
our application flow. But I would also say that, very importantly, we view credit to be very manageable and
confident that the appropriate adjustments have been made, and those adjustments are accounted for in our 2023
vintage.

Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Doug. Good morning, Russ.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, maybe to start off a two-part question. So, you reiterated the margin guidance. I noted you still expect 4% by
end of next year, Russ. How does the cadence in 2024 and 2025 differ under higher for longer and forwards? And
then second, I think you recently decreased the savings and money market rates again for the second time in
recent weeks. Are these cuts there to offset margin weakness in other areas? Or are they actually additive to the
NIM? And does this actually improve the level of the timing you get to that 4%? And I have a follow-up.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Great question. Thanks, Ryan. Maybe I'll just start on the 4% by end of 2025 in terms of NIM. As we said on the
call and we've said before, our 2024 guidance of $325 million to $330 million, exit rate at $340 million to $350
million does not depend on rate cuts. So that guidance is intact even if we are in an environment we're at 5.50%
for the remainder of this year. As you know, we took opportunities at the end of last year effectively putting on
additional hedges in order to take that risk rate off the table for the course of 2024.
Really, what we're talking about is the timing within 2025 in terms of getting to the 4% margin. And, as you can
imagine, we run a range of rate scenarios and that certainly impacts that. I think, based on kind of where we sit
today, our expectation is we get to the 4% NIM towards the end of 2025. But, again, no impact on 2024 even if
we're flat through the course of this year.
On bank deposits and our deposit rates, you are correct. We took another 5 basis points off our savings product.
That's $84 billion of deposits. We took that off this morning. That is just in response to the fact that we've seen
strong deposit flows. Even coming through tax season now, we feel great about where we are. We feel great
about our bank franchise and about just the general level of engagement among our customers.
I'd say at this point, sitting here in mid-April, it's hard to say if that just reflects kind of lower rates and higher NIM
going forward or – what we've done is we've really just kind of taken advantage of the opportunity and pulled it
forward somewhat. But I'd say just sitting right here, we feel great about the franchise and about the stickiness of
our customers and about just the overall competitive environment for deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for the color, Russ. And maybe a question on credit. So I think you noted delinquencies are near or
at the peak on a seasonally adjusted basis; and you said that as we move through 2024, it should be more driven
by recent vintages. So can you help us think about losses over the next few quarters? I think you noted that
seasonally adjusted losses should be down later in the year. Can you maybe just put a finer point on that? When
do we actually see the shift happen from underperforming on a seasonally adjusted basis to actually
outperforming? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. It's through the second half of this year. As you know, the auto asset is great and that you get a really good
sense of how credit's developing over the first 18 months, right? That's when our loans typically hit peak loss rate.
The 2022 vintage was large and, as we've said before, it's a vintage that's been particularly impacted by the
current environment and it's where we're seeing losses that exceed our price expectations.
And so, as we get through the first half of this year, as we get through June, we should be through that and we
should see more of our losses actually driven by our 2023 and then increasingly by our 2024 vintages. As you
know, we've ramped up the level of curtailment over the course of 2023. We're seeing that benefit as we look at
charge-offs and NCOs. And so, our expectation is as that 2023 vintage becomes more dominant in terms of
driving our losses, we'll start to see that performance improve.

Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Doug, you mentioned how different this time the competitive dynamics are. I'm just
curious, as we think about competitors possibly even considering re-engaging with the market, like how easy
would it be to come, sort of disrupt what you guys have in terms of the situation right now? I'm just trying to think
about where they stand in terms of dealer mindshare. Obviously, the dynamics are so strong and put you in a
really good position right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Douglas Timmerman A
Interim Chief Executive Officer & President-Dealer Financial Services, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think the big part of our secret sauce, obviously, is decades of being very consistent and focused on the
things that dealer truly values. Application flow is the differentiator for us. As Russ indicated in his comments, we
ask the dealer to send us all the applications. We're willing to do the work. We don't want to miss out an
opportunity to help them sell another car and truck. We don't want to miss out an opportunity to capture business.
That resonates very well with the dealer. But the dealer is not going to give that opportunity to some multiple
providers. And because of our relationship, we get that advantage. So that's a big differentiator versus the
competition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And Russ, could you just talk about the loan sales? I just want to make sure I understand what happened
this quarter versus what you might do in the future in terms of magnitude. Was there any gain on the sale of the
loans? And maybe as we look ahead, should we expect the economic dynamics to sort of shift as you consider
more of these types of things? And sort of what kind of magnitude could these loan sales take? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think it's a fair question. We've been pretty opportunistic, and so we haven't committed to any
volume. And you'll see that we did loan sales in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. We're not
going to do them every quarter. And we're also looking at different ways of doing it.
So, for example, if we do a credit risk transfer transaction, it's a kind of different impact in terms of the balance
sheet and the P&L versus the loan sale. And so, yes, this is going to be a little bit kind of lumpy, but we think this
is an important tool for us to have as we look at managing capital and positioning ourselves to take advantage of
the opportunities that are in the market today, and also better serve our dealers.
If you just kind of turn to the loan sale we did this quarter, we sold $1.1 billion of loans. There was a $15 million
earnings benefit. And that earnings benefit is effectively the net benefit, given where we hold the loans, including
the reserve and provision impact. And so, that $15 million benefit was realized through the provision line. But that
is a positive P&L event for us and, again, reflects strong investor interest in the overall loan portfolio.
I would say the loans that we sold, they were predominantly 2023 vintage. There was some older stuff in there
from 2022 and 2021 as well. So the blended yield, as we said on the call, was lower than what we're currently

originating in the market today. And so, again, we feel good about the economics we got, given the yield on the
loans that we sold. So, again, strong investor interest. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll look for more
opportunities to do this. And it's all good and allowing us to capture opportunity and better serve our dealers.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Russ, I know the forward curve has sort of eased the
expectation for cuts recently and I know you're still looking for the 4% by the end of 2025 without rate cuts. But if
the forward curve does come through, do you still think there's an opportunity for the 4% to come a bit earlier in
the year, ignoring the lumpiness that might be having on a quarter-to-quarter basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
I think right now, we're on track for 4% by the end of 2025. And so, we feel pretty good about that. We do run a
variety of reasonable rate scenarios here. And we feel pretty good about end of 2025 under a range of scenarios,
including scenarios where we're flat for the duration of 2024. And again, we think we've kind of taken that risk off
the table for this year in terms of its impact on our yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And on the remarketing side, I mean, it seems like you guys have seen some real strength in the lease
termination volumes lately. I think that's coming off the back of the originations you did a couple of years ago. And
I think, the lessee, dealer buyout figure dropped the most – it's dropped since you started disclosing that. Can you
just talk a little bit more about the outlook there? Is that something that could actually maybe help your NIM going
forward even as used car prices continue to kind of moderate? Is there maybe like a kind of Goldilocks type zone
there where used car prices moderating is actually something that helps you as more consumers are bringing
their cars back to you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
I think lease terminations can be a little bit lumpy, and that's one of the factors that contributes to the lumpiness in
terms of our NIM progression. And that's why we give you that 5 basis points to 15 basis points. Yeah, I'd say if I
look over the course of the first quarter, lease terminations were actually weak towards the beginning of the
quarter and kind of came back towards the end. And so, we saw that lumpiness quite frankly even within the
quarter. You know,
I think on the contractual buyouts, I think we expect the level of contractual buyouts to continue to normalize,
particularly as used car prices reached that 120 level that we've been talking about. That's all obviously – that's all
stuff that will ebb and flow over the course of the quarter and over the course of the remainder of the year. But I
think we've priced in kind of reasonable expectations in terms of how we set the guide around just the – kind of

the overall of lease terminations and the level of contractual buyouts, again, normalizing and used car prices

Good morning, Rob.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
One more question around loan sales. Russ, what's the rate limiting factor today that's preventing you or keeping
you from doing more loan sales and taking advantage of this competitive opportunity that you guys are
highlighting? Is it demand from loan buyers or investors? Is it pricing? Is it something else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
No, we've seen really great demand from investors. I think, we've been – we've been able to get done what we've
tried to get done in each of the three transactions that we've completed so far. I think we're – we feel pretty good
about what we've done. Again, we don't set targets on how much want to do in a given quarter or given year. But
again, we continue to feel pretty good about what we've done and we feel pretty good about, on the other side of
it, what we're originating and how it allows us to support our business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay, thanks. And then how much more room do you think you have with respect to deposit repricing, especially
as fewer rate cuts are now being priced in? And then maybe to follow on from that, what degree of deposit
repricing is included in your outlook for the NIM expansion and the exit rate in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Look, we've been really pleased with the amount of pricing flexibility we've gotten so far. As we pointed out on the
call, we took – we started with CDs. We took 75 basis points off of our 12-month, our most popular CD product.
We've taken off liquids. We took another 5 basis points off of our savings product this morning. We continue to
feel great about the deposit flows we're getting. And so, we've seen the competitive environment for deposits has
clearly eased.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Our own demand for deposit growth has obviously changed as well, being 90% funded by deposits with a flat
balance sheet expectation going forward. And so, we feel pretty good about where we are. As I said to Ryan
earlier, it's hard for us to say at this point whether what we've done is we just pulled forward cuts to pricing that we
would have made later or if we're on track to a lower place,. I'd say our overall forecast in terms of exit rate is
conservative. We consider a range of different rate scenarios, including the possibility of Fed funds being flat for
the remainder of the year.
And as you'd expect, our pricing assumptions actually change depending on the actual path of Fed funds and the
overall competitive environment. So it's hard to give you kind of one because we look at a lot of different paths.
But, again, through a range of paths, given the quality – given the strength of the repricing we're seeing on the
auto loan side, given the hedging portfolio that we have in place, we feel pretty good about our exit rate and our
overall NIM guidance for the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Doug and Russ. A flat reserve rate versus falling DQ rate formation suggests growing
conservatism. What's the trigger that would give you comfort allowing that reserve rate to drift back down to day
one levels? And let me flip the question, are you seeing anything that could lead you to have to take reserve
coverage higher from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
I think, as we said on the call, our expectation is we'll keep that reserve coverage flat. I don't think it reflects any
particular conservatism on our side. Quite frankly, it's kind of how we're running the business today. And it reflects
in some ways the fact that as we look at the assets we're originating today versus what we would have originated
in, say, 2019, we are focusing on a product with a richer yield and that carries more credit with it. And we think
we're getting more than compensated for the additional credit that we're taking. But it's a different mix and a
different place in the credit spectrum than we would have been in 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And interest rate risk, you guys put on the hedge in part as protection for a higher for longer rate
environment and it seems to have performed as intended. How are you thinking about any potential future
incremental hedging activity as the rate environment evolves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
We're pretty happy with the performance of the hedges. I think they're performing as intended. They are a bridge
for us, right? They bridge to that kind of natural portfolio turn over to the more recent higher yielding originations.
At this point, our expectation is that we will allow those hedges to amortize and that we're kind of in the right place

Chase Haynes Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hey, how's it going? This is Chase Haynes on for John Pancari. I want to try to get a sense for consumer auto
loan demand just given what you're saying about elevated insurance premiums due to those higher inventory
levels. Is that due to a decrease in demand that you're seeing in big ticket items or is that just a normalization
effect? And do you expect consumer auto demand in the go forward quarters to kind of remain where they've
been at or decrease or increase a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Well, I think it's a little bit unique to us because if you look at our application flow and what we've been hitting
records quarter after quarter after quarter, so we're getting a greater market share of application flow, which
obviously gives us significant kind of up, if you will, relative to what we can originate. And then, of course, if you
put that on top of a competitive environment, that is very constructive for growth. Those are the real two drivers.
But I think the general market is such that I think volumes would be pretty consistent or flat. But I think our ability
to do more is heavily driven just by the fact that we're driving that increased application flow.
