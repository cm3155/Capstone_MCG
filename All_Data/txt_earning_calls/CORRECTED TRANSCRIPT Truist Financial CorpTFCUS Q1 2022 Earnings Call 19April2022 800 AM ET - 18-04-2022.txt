William Henry Rogers Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid first
quarter results, representing the diversity and flexibility of Truist in a more volatile market and business
environment. Net interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count, lower PPP revenue and purchase
accounting. Net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations and more importantly, both NII and NIM
appeared to have bottomed and have good upside from here.
Fee income was below expectations, primarily due to investment banking and mortgage, both of which were
negatively impacted by the market environment. These effects were partially offset by higher insurance income,
which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix. Expenses were lower than expected, reflecting
strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with software fee income.
We experienced continued solid loan growth albeit with headwinds in certain areas. Credit quality remains
excellent, contributing to another provision benefit. We also completed our largest conversion event in February.

There is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as one Truist with an expanded toolkit
to better fulfill our purpose. We'll share more details on these topics during the presentation.
First and foremost, we're guided by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We're
convinced that our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines
how we do business every day and it provides a framework for how we make decisions.
On slide 5, we highlight some of the ways we're bringing purpose to life. A key area of focus for Truist is financial
inclusion. We're wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access for the financial system for all
communities, which is why I'm pleased that the Truist Foundation is supporting non-profits that serve women and
minority-owned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities.
We know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful, and the combination of our
purpose-driven culture with our industry-leading compensation and benefits, training, development and flexible
approach to work is highly effective in attracting and retaining top talent. We plan to further strengthen our
benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year, subject to shareholder
approval.
We also implemented our Truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on-
site work throughout March. Personally, it was just incredibly energizing to have so much in-person engagement
over the last two months, whether with teammates, clients, community members or shareholders. Hybrid and
more flexible work is here to stay, but I'm pleased at how our teammates have embraced this new model.
We're also doing our part [ph] to convert (00:04:47) climate change and in late January, announced our plans to
achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We're externalizing our own net zero aspirations and
furthering the transition to a low carbon economy by adding new teammates in our CIB and commercial
community bank to help our clients make their own transition.
Lastly, we completed our largest core bank conversion event in February. This was an enormous undertaking,
with that involved transitioning nearly 7 million clients to the Truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly 6,000 Truist
signs across our footprint, which will further build our brand. The integration was successful overall, especially
when you consider the scale and complexity involved. This was the largest bank technology integration in over 15
years. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal
sacrifices they've made to ensure the integration was successful. Because of you, we now have millions of Truist
clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience.
At the same time, it's also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly. I've acknowledged
there were some opportunities to improve along the way. Our teams did an incredible job in resolving client
challenges with urgency and a view towards long-term client and teammate experience improvements. My
commitment, though, is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied.
Moving to slide 7, our adjusted results exclude $166 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges
and a $155 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. We also generated a $57
million after-tax gain on redemption of a non-controlling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain
merchant service relationships, which will provide Truist a larger share of the economics and more control over
the end-to-end client experience.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Finally, we incurred a $53 million after-tax loss to reposition approximately $3 billion of securities to enhance our
yield by approximately 100 basis points. The total EPS impacts of these items was $0.24 per share. Daryl will
provide more details on these items later in the presentation.
Turning to our first quarter performance highlights on slide 8, we earned $1.3 billion and $0.99 a share on a
reported basis. Excluding the selected items on slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.23 per share,
up 4.2% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by lower loan loss provision. Compared to the fourth quarter,
adjusted EPS declined 11% driven primarily by a 4% decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging
market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some
normal seasonal patterns.
Adjusted ROTCE was a strong 22.6%, unchanged from the prior two quarters. Even excluding the reserve
release, adjusted ROTCE was still a strong 19.9%.
Adjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to
software fee income in addition to our ongoing merger-related cost save efforts.
While operating leverage was a negative 240 basis points year-over-year, we are still targeting positive operating
leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality continues to be excellent. Net charge-offs remained low, contributing
to a provision benefit during the quarter.
Capital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard
and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth. I'll provide more details of our
loan growth shortly.
Overall, we're off to a slower start in 2022 than we would like, but I believe our performance can improve
throughout the year. In addition to the core bank conversion, we completed the migration of our retail business
and wealth plans to the new Truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences.
As you'll recall, early in the merger, we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than
relying on existing systems and third-parties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients. We
built this new platform based directly on clients' feedback and we've introduced it in ways, learning from each
release and continually improving.
With a more modern and agile platform and approach, we're able to introduce a number of new features to both
sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements
will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from
integration.
A great example of this will be Truist Assist, which will be our new cloud-based self-service digital assistant that
we'll introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients 24/7 via various digital channels.
Truist Assist will help clients execute basic tasks, schedule appointments and provide insights and
recommendations, so they can have more control and confidence in their financial well-being.
In addition, we're executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our
clients' and teammates' digital experience including, but not limited to, digital payments, digital onboarding,
enhanced authentication technology, and expanding LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time
cloud-based core.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Turning to loans and leases on slide 10, average loan balances grew 0.8% sequentially and rose 1.2% excluding
PPP loans. Sequential loan growth was driven primarily by C&I, which increased 5.1% excluding PPP and
mortgage warehouse lending where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes.
Loans grew across all CIB industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our asset finance
group. Commercial community bank C&I loans grew 2.4% excluding PPP, fairly broad based across many of our
regions. Revolver utilization and revolver exposure, both grew in the quarter.
CRE continues to be a headwind given a very competitive market, but we're optimistic that we're approaching
stabilization. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased 2% driven primarily by a 3% decline in
auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment. We also
experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios. These pressures were partly
offset by Service Finance, which is performing well and off to a great start.
This quarter, we were also excited to announce a new alliance with State Farm whereby their agents will be able
to offer consumer lending products through LightStream. We'll pilot this program later in the year and loan
volumes will build over time. This alliance reflects Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance in addition to the
superior digital capabilities and client experience that LightStream provides.
In summary, we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of current economic
conditions in our pipelines, our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration, and our
differentiated set of consumer businesses. At the same time, though, we got to acknowledge the increased
uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risks, which could cause loan growth to deviate
from our outlook.
Now, turning to deposits on slide 11, average deposit balances increased 1% during the first quarter, reflecting
some moderation from the 2% pace observed in the fourth quarter. Total deposit costs were stable at 3 basis
points. As interest rate environment evolves, we'll take a balanced approach to managing deposits, being
attentive to client needs and client relationships, while maximizing value outside of rate pay. Guided by our
purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients, as previously announced, we'll discontinue a
host of overdraft-related fees at the end of this month.
We also remain on track to launch our new Truist One checking account experience this summer, which will have
zero overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to – via a simple $100
negative balance buffer and a deposit-based credit line limit up to $750. We're mindful of the impacts that inflation
and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients, particularly the least advantaged, and Truist
One is one of the many examples of where we're advancing financial inclusion. Despite the financial impacts
we've discussed previously, this is a long-term win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention,
increase acquisition and enhance the overall client experience.
With that, let me now turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.

Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 12, net interest income decreased 2% sequentially
as the impacts of two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth
and higher securities yields.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased 2 basis points, both exceeding our
guidance by 2 basis points. The improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium
amortization in the securities portfolio.
Moving to slide 13, Truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, being
well-positioned to benefit from higher rates in the near term while maintaining some level of downside protection if
and when interest rates decline.
We continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a 100 basis point ramp rate increase would increase NII by 4.3%,
a 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.3%. Approximately 80% of our reported asset sensitivity is from
the short end of the curve. While early, deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations.
Moving to slide 14, adjusted revenue declined 4.4% linked quarter, which is below our guidance range of down
1% to 2% and driven almost entirely by weaker than expected fee income. Fees declined 8% sequentially,
reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality.
Investment banking and trading income declined $116 million, or 31%, as more volatile market conditions
impacted M&A, high yield/leveraged finance, and equity. Investment banking pipelines look healthy, but market
conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized.
Residential mortgage income declined $70 million, or 44%, as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and
pressured gain on sale margins on the production side. Servicing was not as large of an offset as expected since
the benefits of slowing decay were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve.
Card and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined $33 million collectively, primarily driven by
seasonality but also due to client-friendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our February
conversion. These items were partially offset by insurance income, which increased 9% primarily due to strong
organic growth in the first month of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. We included a table at the bottom of slide
14 to make other income trends more clear.
Other income excluding changes in our non-qualified plan and other gains was up $31 million sequentially given
negative valuation adjustment for Visa-related derivative last quarter and up $56 million year-over-year, primarily
as a result of higher SBIC income.
Turning to slide 15, reported expenses were $3.7 billion, including $216 million of merger-related costs and $202
million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The merger costs in the quarter were primarily
connected to new Truist signs, branch closings and impairments, and data center decommissioning efforts.
Adjusted expenses decreased 0.4% sequentially, exceeding our guidance of up 1% to 2% and reflecting our
disciplined expense management. The drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs, reflecting lower
incentive compensation expense and changes to the non-qualified plan, partially offset by seasonally higher FICA
and 401(k) expenses. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as
we continue building our brand.
Compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from FTE reductions and
lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing, along with higher

operational losses. The operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing
higher levels of fraud activity in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience.
We remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same
time. Overall, we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events, both in the merger
categories as well as run rate fees and expenses. We're excited that our last major conversion event is behind us
and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations.
Moving to slide 16, asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and
favorable economic conditions. Our net charge-off ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at 25 basis points.
The ALLL ratio decreased to 1.44%, resulting in a provision benefit of $95 million for the first quarter. Our reserve
levels reflect current credit conditions, but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation, rising rates
and geopolitical events.
Truist has no direct credit exposure to Russia or Ukraine and minimal indirect exposure. [indiscernible] (00:19:34)
our exposure to subprime at the origination is 1% or less in the other consumer portfolios.
Continuing on slide 17, capital and liquidity levels remained strong. Our CET1 ratio declined approximately 20
basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and certain
merchant service relationships, growth in risk-weighted assets and the CECL phase-in.
In order to mitigate AOCI risk and volatility, we transferred approximately 40% of the securities portfolio to held to
maturity during the first quarter. Because we are a Category III institution, AOCI does not impact regulatory
capital. It simply impacts tangible common equity. We submitted our capital plans to the Federal Reserve in early
April and look forward to sharing more details later this summer.
Moving to slide 18, this slide provides additional details about three transactions we completed in the first quarter
to enhance our future earnings and profitability. First, Kensington Vanguard acquisition significantly expands our
presence in title insurance, augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions, and
will also provide additional IRM opportunities given our significant presence in CRE. We anticipate Kensington
Vanguard will add $115 million revenue annually and be accretive to insurance EBITDA margin by year two.
Second, we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which Truist had a non-controlling interest. The
transaction resulted in a $74 million gain for marking our stake to fair value. In addition, we acquired significant
portion of relationships from this alliance. This will position us to control more of the end-to-end client experience
when serving those clients. We also believe that the acquisition would generate approximately $25 million of
additional cash PPNR annually.
Last, we repositioned $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in a
two-year payback.
Moving to slide 20, as Bill mentioned, we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in February.
We're now one Truist not just culturally, but also in terms of branding, digital and technology, which allows us to
serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate.
As we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence, we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining
cost savings. Much of that will happen in the second half of 2022 as we decommission over 900 business
applications and 3 of our 6 data centers. Our decommissioning efforts are complex and significant, and we are on

track. With our final integration largely complete, our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing
client and teammate experience.
Turning to slide 21, we have made excellent progress across the five cost save buckets and are closing in on our
commitment to achieve $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Third-party spend is down 11.9% from baseline levels,
exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%.
This quarter, we closed over 400 branches, exceeding our commitment to close over 800 total branches by the
end of the first quarter of 2022. We now have finished the merger-related branch reduction efforts and will shift to
more normal course branch network optimization.
We have also achieved our targeted reduction in non-branch facility space, strategically reducing our occupancy
costs through consolidation and closures. However, we still have more opportunities in which we are working.
Excluding acquisitions, average FTEs are down 1% linked quarter and 14% since the merger.
Our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next two quarters, further supporting our
ongoing cost saving efforts.
I will now provide guidance for the full year 2022 and new guidance for the second quarter. In 2022, we now
expect adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% from 2021. Relative to our outlook from January, the mix of revenue
growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates,
partially offset by weaker fees, primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking. This represents 6% to
7% core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in PPP and purchase accounting.
As you will recall, we expect a mid-single digit decline in service charges in 2022 given our elimination of certain
overdraft-related fees and introduction of Truist One Banking. NII and net interest margin bottomed in the first
quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve. We continue to expect point-to-point
loan growth, ex-PPP, in the mid-single digits. But, as Bill said, we acknowledge higher levels of economic
uncertainty. We will be at the high end of our 1% to 2% increase of adjusted non-interest expense largely due to
the impact of Kensington Vanguard acquisition.
The first quarter was the peak for our merger-related costs and now, we are projecting less than $400 million for
the rest of this year and none in 2023. We are still targeting positive operating leverage on a GAAP and adjusted
basis in 2022, though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions. We still expect net
charge-off ratio to be in the 30 to 40 basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year.
Looking into the second quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high-single digit with possible upside from the
first quarter level, as a result, higher net interest income and much stronger fee income given seasonality in
insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking. This outlook assumes the forward curve in interest
rates and control deposit betas. We expect core net interest margin to increase approximately 7 to 10 basis points
due to benefits from the March hike and from a projected 50 basis point hike in May. GAAP net interest margin is
expected to increase only 3 to 4 basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing, given lower
prepayment environment as a result of higher rates.
Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Thanks, Daryl. Moving to slide 22, the first quarter of 2022 was historic for Truist, as we're now serving our clients
as a true unified Truist across all dimensions. In addition, the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point
for Truist. Strategically, the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focus to
executional excellence, transformation and growth. Our businesses that went through earlier conversions in 2021
such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift, whether in the form new advisor hiring
in wealth or significantly improved client satisfaction scores in mortgage.
Financially, the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee
performance should improve as market conditions normalize. And we capitalize on the significant integrated
relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company. In addition, the completion of
the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of 2022 and we'll realize our
remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year, all of which
help drive positive operating leverage.
To conclude, I remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for Truist, all of which are clearly
summarized on slide 23, our investment thesis. Our opportunity and priorities are clear: shift from an integration
focus to execution focus, deliver better client experiences, capture the significant IRM and revenue synergy
potential we have, and shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building
better lives for our clients. This shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital. It only requires
execution and focus.
At the same time, while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term, the headwinds of
geopolitical uncertainty coupled with inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of
monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlooks as we move further into this year and next. Truist is
well-positioned across all of these environments given our advice-oriented model for our clients, balanced
approach to interest rate risk management, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, and strong and
improving earnings profile.
And with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Bill, can you elaborate, or Daryl as well, I guess, on the loan growth that you guys are seeing? I think, Bill, you
touched on some very competitive forces in the commercial real estate markets. And what are you guys seeing in
that area? And then on the residential mortgage business, Daryl, I think you referenced that the refinancing
business was down. What percentage originations are refinancing in the home mortgage business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Gerard, let me start on the loan growth and maybe sort of cover a variety of different topics in your question.
We're seeing interesting loan growth and I think the places that most highly correlate to performance, I think, is
where we're performing well. So, think C&I as an example. So, in C&I, if you exclude PPP, where remember, we
were over-indexed appropriately, you exclude the mortgage warehouse component, which has a lot of seasonal
components to it and sort of dissected the core C&I, it was up about a little over 5%. So, we think that actually
reflects the core component of where we see loan growth and the power and the execution of our franchise.
That was particularly strong and literally across all of our business lines. It was good across virtually all of our
geographies, areas like asset finance and ABL sort of [ph] geared (00:31:08) supply chain were particularly
strong.
You asked about CRE and I'd say it's a couple of different stories. On the small CRE side, we have had some run
offs, some of that's been intentional in the focused areas. On the sort of higher end institutional borrowers, we
actually performed very well. We've been very competitive on the residential and industrial side, particularly think
specialized areas like data centers and those type of things. Clients are buying portfolios.
But it is an aggressive market. So I think the places where we want to be competitive, we were really competitive
and the areas that we've allowed a little run-off, we've allowed a little run-off to happen there.
Daryl, do you want to talk specifically about I think there was a question about the refi?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. On the residential, Gerard, about two-thirds of our activity was in refinance activity. That has really come
down significantly. As we move to the second quarter, it's more of a purchase market, kind of plays to our strength
from that perspective. So I think we're hopeful that, that will kind of maintain and hopefully build as the year goes
on, but refi is definitely being impacted.
The other impact on the residential mortgage is just the cost of hedging is just a lot higher right now. So, it's
offsetting some of the servicing benefit that you would get out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, Bill, Truist has a unique franchise where you've got your regional [ph]
precedence (00:32:45) throughout your franchise, so you have a good pulse on what's going on in those markets.
Can you give us an update on what your customers are telling you? Obviously, we're in a very uncertain time with
the tragedy going on over in Ukraine. What are they feeling and are they still pretty optimistic about their business
outlooks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Maybe I'll do it in two ways and maybe I'll do it – starting with the tangible side. If you look at production
and pipeline specifically, they're really strong. Our pipelines, particularly in that core commercial business, which
you're talking about, in the first quarter are equal to where they were in the fourth quarter in terms of strength.
So, in terms of evidence of what we see in terms of pipelines and production, I'd say there still is a great deal of
confidence. Virtually, every client is in some inventory build capacity. I mean, from a supply chain perspective,
they're all wishing to increase their inventory to serve an increasing demand. Demand does not seem to be the
particular challenge. So, I would say that's the tangible part.
Now, the intangible part in talking to the clients, so where everybody is and what's some of the anecdotal
evidence, I don't think we're in a full risk-off mode, but there is a little bit of a wait and see. I mean, I think that's
fair, maybe a little bit of a blinking yellow light, not a red light, nobody's stopping.
So, I think the combination of this tangible part that we see in terms of pipeline production, need for inventory
build is really solid and would be reasons to be really optimistic, all with just a little bit of a cautionary note as
people look forward into the next several quarters.

I think the only thing I would add to that, on the consumer side, it's fair to say in February during the conversion,
our branch people were really distracted just going through the integration and the efforts. I think we've come out
of that strong now and we're starting to see momentum in the loan origination out of the branch areas. And if you

look at our consumer convenient businesses that we have like LightStream and Sheffield and Service Finance,
they're all starting off really strong and seeing really good volumes as we enter into the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A

Yeah. So, I think to bump those comments, I mean, there's reason to have a lot of optimism with just a slight light
level of uncertainty, which I think sort of is the right balance.

Good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
One question on just the outlook here for how we should be thinking about net interest margin. And part of the
reason I ask is when I'm looking at the average balances where you show what the yields did Q-on-Q, we had
some declines in consumer loans. So I'm just wondering was that, like, swap related or is there something more
intimate going on in the portfolio. I'm just wondering how quickly that should bounce back, given the outlook for
rates that you've got.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, I think what you're looking at and we can maybe check offline, but I think it's just the run off of
purchase accounting. When you look at our new rates going on in the books, our new volume rates are going on
higher than what the existing portfolio is right now. So, we are averaging up in most cases across the board there.
So, I think overall yields will rise. And when we have our projections throughout the year, I expect net interest
margin to continue to rise throughout the year, NII to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb.

And then just a follow on there is, how do you think about your deposit strategy? How interested are you going to
be in generating accelerating direct deposit growth or would you be more in the mode of allowing run-off just
trying to understand the balance sheet size and how we should think through that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
If you look at what we've attracted from COVID, $80-plus-billion of new deposit funding, the vast majority of that is
non-interest bearing. And when you look at it, we paid lowest rates of anybody else in the industry. So, almost all
of it is non-rate sensitive. So, we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect
out there. There could be a little bit of ebb and flow, but for the most part, we will be specific to make sure that we
protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that.
But right now, we've had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that we're seeing right now are coming
in much less than what we modeled. It's very early into this, but I think right now, I think it's not a huge impact on
what we've had to pay there and we still have deposits growing for us. So, non-interest bearing [ph] grow from us
in (00:38:12) this past quarter as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And Betsy, what I might add to that, we're operating now as a new Truist. So, we're operating with a company that
has about 18% average market share, so – and number one, two or three market share in most of our markets,
so that's a new experience. Also, this has increased capacity and marketing expense.
So, our unaided brand awareness has really gone up actually fairly significantly since the rollout and then we just
have a lot more capabilities other than rate pay. I mean, we just have a lot more tools and capabilities to offer our
clients. So, we're operating in a kind of – this is a kind of environment we build Truist forward in fairness, to have
a company that's got that kind of prowess and capability to serve our clients in ways other than just rate pay.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the securities portfolio and the repositionings you did this
quarter. So, can you just talk a little bit about, just where do you want that portfolio size to sit and is the changes
that you made the sales and the repurchases in the forward outlook for NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think the way we are managing the balance sheet and we've talked about this before is, right now, we
are targeting $15 billion to $20 billion of balances at the Fed. Since the war started in the first quarter, we tilted a
little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes. And you really look at the cash flows of the
whole balance sheet in total.

So, we've had deposit growth come in, so that's a positive inflow. You have run-off of security, that's a positive
inflow. Our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that. Once we've done what we can do
from a lending perspective, then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio. Now, from a
securities portfolio perspective, we're investing in the past in treasuries, MBS, so those are the very high grade,
very secure type securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then the repositioning that you did this quarter, I assume that, that's built into the outlook and, I guess,
is that generally where you're purchasing now. You've mentioned in the slide deck 3.2%, is that where the front
book is from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, yeah, the mix of what you're doing if you go into treasuries, [ph] it isn't in the (00:40:57) forecast. Treasuries
are in the 2.70s, 2.80s. You're in the three- to five-year area. MBS are approaching 4%, so a blend there, but I
would say we'd be on a shorter end of that on the duration perspective, but all that is incorporated with the
guidance we gave you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. Thanks, Daryl.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Thanks. I just want to follow-up on Ken's question. Just more broadly, how are you guys thinking about managing
capital on the regulatory side? You're still well above your regulatory minimums with the 9.4% CET1, but a little bit
below where you usually target. How are you thinking about that? And then on the GAAP side, how are you
thinking about managing against further OCI risks as rates keep going up potentially? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, John, it's Bill. Why don't I maybe start on the capital side? I mean, I think we've been very consistent about
thinking about where we wanted to establish capital, where we wanted to operate based on three primary factors.
One was just where we were in the merger. How much risk did we have in the merger? Do we need to allow
additional capital for merger risk? That's obviously come down substantially. I mean, I would consider that sort of
be in a normal mode right now, and we've gotten through the big components of that really, really successfully.
The second is, how much economic risk do we have? And we probably have a little more economic risk in
fairness than we had a year ago, but I think maybe on the marginal side. And then sort of where we fit from a risk
profile as evidenced by some of the CCAR results. And I think it'll be another confirmation of our lower risk profile,
higher PPNR model as Truist.

Truist Financial Corp.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
So those are the three things that we put into the mixing bowl as it relates to capital and we'll continue to
reevaluate that. We feel very comfortable where we are right now. We'll reevaluate that in the mid part of this year
and try to determine the appropriate place for Truist to operate, but I feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in the
capital side based on the evaluation of those risks.
And then, Daryl, I'll let you answer the other part of that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, so on the OCI, John, what I would tell you is, Category III, it's not in our regulatory capital numbers. 99% of
our portfolio is guaranteed, so it's just a matter of timing. We're going to get the funding back. It's not a permanent
impairment that you see. There are partial offsets. Once a year, you mark your pension plan. That mark will
obviously be against what the OCI is, which would be some benefit at 12/31.
But the real hedge, when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits. I mean, deposits have
increased in value. We don't mark-to-market these non-maturity deposits, but we really look at it. The value of that
has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio. So, that's really, I think, the offset
that you see there.
If we wanted to, we could put more than 40% into held to maturity. I don't think we're there yet where we need to
do that from that perspective. I think we feel good with what we've done today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then one nitpick as a follow-up, Daryl. The duration of the AFS portfolio before the transfers, I think it
was about 5.8 years. Do you have the new number on what that looks like now after you moved some to held to
maturity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
About 6.5 years and our modeling even with rates going up higher is basically capped out. So, we're really in the
6 handle and that's where it's going to be until rates start to fall again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Good morning. Sorry if I missed that earlier, but did you say how much of the $1.6 billion of cost saves you're
looking to achieve by year end in the 1Q run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Matt, what I would say it's pretty minimal. I mean, we had a little bit more reduction in VSRP at the
beginning of the quarter. Most of the branch closures were backend loaded in the quarter. Some of the
technology savings that's going to come through that's really all in the second half. We have a little bit more
closures in corporate real estate. So, I would say it's much more backend loaded. We maybe got a little bit, but
the vast majority of it would be in the second half of 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. When you say a little bit, meaning a little bit more than last quarter, right, because you already had at least
the chunk of the $1.6 billion in the run rate at year end, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
That's right, yeah. So we were two-thirds of the way through at the end of the year. We made a little bit of
progress in the first quarter. And we got more to do in the second half of 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would say, Matt, I mean, we – yeah, Matt, we're on really good track on the cost saves. I mean, we're
ahead in most of the categories where we want to be and now, we've got a couple of remaining big chunky ones
and they're binary. You close the data center and you get the cost saves. I mean, so, we feel really good about
where we are in that trajectory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then more broadly speaking, like, as we think about costs beyond this year, how should we think about
what Truist is trying to be? Like, is this a kind of keep expense growth low? Is it an operating leverage story?
Because, obviously, there has been lots of puts and takes with the merger. We also have inflation. We also have
revenue benefiting from rates, which is usually a very good efficiency business. But what is Truist, from an
expense perspective, looking out beyond this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think Matt, if we think about sort of overall for Truist, what we expect to be as a low efficiency ratio
company, so I think the construct of our business mix and our structure allows us to be a low efficiency – industry-
leading, low efficiency ratio company. So, where that ends on an absolute basis will depend on a lot of market
conditions, but we'll be at the low end of that.

We'll be a company with higher growth potential and less volatility. So I mean when we think about how expenses
fit into that rather than sort of the absolute dollar amount in light of expenses that support a growing business and
being able to do that with, I think, an industry-leading low efficiency ratio.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just – first, just a clarification. So, you've guided revenue growth for this year from 2% to 4% up to 3% to 4%
and you expect $500 million of merger savings by year end from this point forward, is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Roughly, I would say $400 million to $500 million, Mike, because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then more generally, Bill, you just talked about your terminal and state superior growth, superior
efficiency. And from what you said before, you have superior geographies, superior business mix, superior levers
with the merger model. So, superior but then you look at the current loan growth and its average, the current
deposit growth, it's average, operating leverage this year looks average. So superior features, but average
results. I know you're going from integration to kind of execution but from our standpoint, it looks like you're in a
Corvette going 60 miles per hour. So, when will this superior positioning lead to superior growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Okay. We're going to assume we're on the Autobot. We have no speed limits in terms of opportunity. And, Mike,
we're at that inflection point. I mean, we talked about this. This is – I think, we're right at that pivot point. And I can
feel it. I mean, I can feel all the things if you categorize loan growth, but if we break it down to, I think, the things
that are highly correlated to positive trajectory, I think those are areas where actually we're doing well, things like
sort of core C&I. Other decisions on loan growth are related to decisions we've made about positioning our
company, which I think will be really beneficial to us long-term.
And then I look at sort of the pivot points of – I mean, I'll pick several categories if I look at integrated relationship
management. It wasn't at the level we needed it to be in sort of the fourth quarter. First quarter, we've made the
pivot point and we're starting to see significant increase and you'll start to see that in some of our results. You see
18

that a little bit in the insurance results in this quarter. Where we are in terms of positive asset flow in wealth,
wealth teams and insurance teams, net positive in terms of adding people, so we've reached sort of really good
inflection points there.
Investment banking, clearly, in terms of adding, retaining and opportunities in those businesses, things like the
core commercial pipelines; where we are in terms of more lead deals, more on the left side; where we are
positioned in terms of production in the places we want to be.
So, I can feel the inflection point. So maybe we're at, whatever it was, 60 miles an hour, but the foot is on the
accelerator, not the brake. And I totally feel that in the transition that we're making at this particular juncture. And
I'm very confident about our positioning for the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just one follow-up. So what percentage of your time was spent on the merger before and how much of it
was spent on continued integration now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. If I look at my personal calendar, I don't think I've been in Charlotte in the last five weeks or so. I mean, so
the – I look at all of our leaders' time in terms of where they're spending time and it's a significant difference. I've
been much more in front of teammates, in front of clients and community and just my own personal time, I can
feel it. And in fairness, I'm just one [ph] symbol. (00:51:49) More teammates have been in that mode for a longer
period of time than I have. And we feel that power shift.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the medium-term efficiency goal of the low-50s, I just want to get a little bit more color from you in terms of
what exactly would you say is needed to get there in terms of the rate backdrop, and then also in terms of timing
that you see is reasonable to get to that low-50s range? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, you kind of go back to where we were when we announced this transaction back in 2019, rates were
a couple hundred basis points higher back then. And at that point, we thought, well, if we got those cost saves, we
would be able to come in at the low-50s at that point. We're definitely a different company. We continue to buy
and add businesses and all that, but we definitely have at least a forecast from the Fed for it to go up a couple of
hundred basis points this year and into 2023.
So, assuming you get the Fed up to 3% to 3.5% and we will execute on our cost saves, we should have really
strong efficiency ratios coming in. Whether we get to low-50s or not, I think there's a shot that that could happen
just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the company and what we're seeing in the marketplace, our
deposit betas, how they perform. So, no guarantees from that perspective, but rates going up definitely helps on
the net interest income side significantly, and it's back to kind of where we were back in 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, Daryl. And also on the expense side, your expectation for the $492 million in incremental
expenses related to the merger to roll off in 2023, what are the biggest drivers of that decline? I know you
mentioned consolidation of data centers. Like, if you can you just give us a little more granularity around what are
the biggest components? And related to that, I know you indicated you completed your core conversion.
Regarding the core deposit system, what was the upgrade there, where did you move to? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yes. So from a cost save perspective, obviously, technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would
come in. So, that would be the majority of the savings, both data centers, application systems, FTEs, all in that
area would, basically, will be big cost savings. We still have more to do on – a little bit on the VSRP, that will help
benefit. You have more on corporate real estate reductions. So, we have other savings.
So, I would say overall, now that we've moved from the integration to now running and operating the company, we
will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the company to give us more fuel to make more
investments in the company as we move forward from that perspective. And I'll put it back to Bill.

Yeah. And then on the core conversion, I mean, we consolidated to our heritage core platform, but that doesn't
really sort of explain the next-gen opportunities we have within that. So, you think about the use of cloud-based
and API technologies to create, for example, a digital experience which we've talked about. So, this concept of a
digital straddle, we were able to convert, add flexibility and add products and capabilities to our clients digitally
long before we converted them physically in the core conversion.
So, I think we've got a really good strong first-, second-gen core platform with third-gen, fourth-gen kind of
capabilities that sit on top of that. And then, as you know, we're also experimenting with new core platform for
LightStream. So, I think we've got our feet in the right place where we want to be in terms of maximum flexibility
with existing core and experimenting with the new core with LightStream and a product called [ph] FinSAC
(00:56:44), which we talked about before. And this digital straddle agility, I think, will really, really pay strong
dividends for us going forward.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Just wanted to touch base on credit, one, Bill, Daryl, if you can just talk to us about the
consumer book, be it Sheffield, LightStream, anything in particular that you're watching around consumer trends?
There's fair amount of concern around credit quality. And I'm not sure if you can give any breakdown in terms of
FICO score within that consumer book, Daryl?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Clarke, do you mind [ph] taking that? (00:57:33)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ebrahim, what I would say is that the area we're most focused on from the consumer standpoint around
more path to normalization or any potential stress out there with the inflationary pressures would be in our
subprime auto book. Remember, that book is less than $5 billion, so high return business. So, we are watching
that really closely and so we're seeing the credit performance more normalized there.
I would say for the remaining consumer segments, we principally have a prime-based portfolio. So, less than 1%
or so of our borrowers in those segments would be considered non-prime. So, it's not just as big of an issue there,
but I would say our expectations are that you'll continue to see as we go through the rest of the year more
normalization on the consumer side first and where we're watching most closely would be the lower income
consumer in our subprime auto.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, when we look at the reserve ratio at 1.44%, just give us a context of
day one CECL and where you expect that to bottom out given sort of the macro uncertainties, Bill and Daryl
talked about? Thinks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure. And just to remind you all, our day one CECL was at 1.54% and Q2 level now is at 1.44%, so it's down 9
bps from the first quarter. And so, the other point I would make to you is our reserve coverage is even at that
level, are very strong to NCOs and NPAs.
So, the way we think about CECL, we continue to incorporate multiple economic scenarios in the estimate,
including maintaining a pretty healthy weighting on our downside case. We also this quarter considered
qualitatively precision and uncertainty with respect to inflationary pressures, rate increases and the war in
Ukraine. But remind you, I'd also reflected the outstanding performance we had from a risk profile and a credit
performance for the quarter.
So, all that being said, we still anticipate potentially additional reserves in 2022, but probably at a decelerated
pace compared to last year and I would just say this, obviously, the number and the amount of the releases is
really dependent upon how the economic situation unfolds.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. Maybe just one clarification question for me. Underneath your revenue guide of 3% to 4%, is it
fair for us to assume that given the outlook for Fed funds for the rest of the year, we should take that 7.2% in the
up 200 bps ramp scenario from slide 13, as sort of maybe the starter point for the NII growth for 2022 and maybe
take 80% of that to up 5.8%, then later on how we're thinking about loan growth and the long end of the curve?

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, a lot of moving parts there. What I would say is that in spirit, I think using a good gauge with a gradual
over 200 bps, I think, is a good approximation. The deposit betas we talked about earlier, we have those being
phased in and that's built into these numbers. So, we're expecting 25% in the first 100 bps, 35% in the next 100
bps, and then 50% after that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Right now, we're performing better than that, but we definitely have pickup in trajectory. If this forward curve does
play out as what's embedded in there, you'll see a big increase in both core and net interest margin from where
we are today, probably piercing 3% maybe by the end of the year.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So the follow-up here is, given what you've baked into the deposit betas in the first 100 bps, which could be
very minimal, the 7.2% in the up 200 bps could be the floor in terms of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I think we have good conservative estimates, so there is a chance for outperformance, but it's still very early,
Erika, so you don't really know, but I feel pretty good with these projections and feel good. Bill talked earlier about
our deposit base and our clients and density that we have. So, I think we're going to have really positive net
interest income as this year plays out into 2023.

Got it. Thanks.
