Head-Investor Relations, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call.
Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page

Thomas P. Gibbons
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.
Referring to slide 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we continue to see healthy underlying momentum
across most of our businesses and reported revenue of $3.9 billion, which was roughly flat year-over-year, and it
was up 2% if you exclude the impact of government sanctions and the additional actions that were taken related
to Russia.
Now, we're in an increasingly uncertain environment, including the war in Ukraine, volatile markets and
persistently higher inflation, which will require more meaningful monetary policy adjustments. It is in times like
these that our strong, lower-risk balance sheet and the resiliency of our business model differentiates us.
In the face of the tragic events occurring in Ukraine, we ceased new banking business in Russia and suspended
investment management purchases of Russian securities. Since the beginning of the war, we stepped up our
humanitarian efforts as well as the support for our employees and the members of our community who have been

impacted. And we continue working for our multinational clients that depend on our custody and record-keeping
services to manage their exposures.
Expenses of $3 billion were up 5.5% as we continue to invest in further growth and efficiency initiatives. And we
reported EPS of $0.86, and that included an $0.08 impact related to Russia. We continue to generate a significant
amount of capital and returned close to 60% of earnings to our shareholders, primarily through common
dividends.
Throughout the quarter, we took actions in the investment securities portfolio to temper the immediate impact to
capital from higher interest rates. And we expect higher rates to be both a positive for fees and net interest
revenue going forward. Emily will discuss the details for the quarter shortly, but let me briefly touch on a few
business highlights.
In Asset Servicing, we managed to keep the strong sales momentum with which we entered the year. Wins and
win rates improved off of what had been a healthy quarter a year ago. Won and mandated AUC/A is up
meaningfully both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, producing a strong pipeline of AUC/A to be installed in
2022 and beyond. And our retention rate was an exceptional 97%.
Our ETF business continues to stand out, having increased the number of funds serviced by 4% since the
beginning of the year. And we were recognized as Best ETF Custodian at the ETF Express European Awards last
month. We also continued building momentum as a leader in digital assets, having been selected by Circle as
primary custodian for the USD coin reserves.
And late last week, we announced an exciting data and digital collaboration with Aon. Together, we will focus on
supporting the ESG needs of clients globally, leveraging our collective data and analytics capabilities and unique
data sets to help clients make better, more informed investment strategy decisions by providing enhanced data
sets, advanced analytics and actionable insights into ESG portfolio-level exposures.
In Pershing, year-over-year comparisons continue to be impacted by the previously disclosed lost business in the
second half of last year. And remember, the first quarter of last year was exceptionally strong on the back of
elevated transaction activity.
Now, while there are puts and takes here that can impact the amount of organic growth in any given quarter, we
remain extremely excited about Pershing's prospects. Our clients are doing well and as they capture new assets,
we're growing with them. And we're well positioned to benefit from a number of secular growth trends, such as the
rapid growth in number of breakaway advisors and digitally oriented wealth firms.
Of course, consolidation in the sector can leave us on either side of any particular transaction. But over time, we
find that our clients who are typically the largest and most complex players in the industry are more often than not
on the acquiring side.
And in Pershing X, we continue to make solid progress since announcing the initiative back in October. Following
on last quarter's acquisition of Optimal Asset Management, this quarter, we made several key hires, which
completed the filling out of our leadership team. And we folded Albridge's wealth reporting and data aggregation
tool under the Pershing X umbrella. This alignment strengthens Pershing X's data offering, allows it to draw on
Albridge's engineers to accelerate development of the platform and provides clients with access to a broader suite
of technology solutions.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Shifting to Clearance and Collateral Management, there, we delivered a strong quarter of organic growth on the
back of higher securities clearance volumes and as collateral management balances remained elevated at a
record $5 trillion in the quarter. Market volatility is driving dealer demand for US treasuries and we're also seeing
a promising pick-up in new collateral balances related to our future of collateral initiatives, with asset balances
already being mobilized to the EMEA region and growing, providing our clients with optimization and funding
benefits.
Treasury Services also delivered another solid quarter of growth, driven by higher payment volumes and an
improved product mix. The business continued to build on its recent track record of industry first, this quarter
being the first bank to successfully connect to and send a message on the FedNow real-time payment system.
And we're excited to welcome Jennifer Barker to the company as the new CEO of the business starting in May.
Jennifer brings almost two decades of global client experience in the Treasury Services industry, and she is the
perfect leader to build upon the business' recent success and innovative track record.
In Investment Management, given the environment, it's not surprising to see some challenges as clients in higher-
earning funds rebalance and de-risk. That said, investment performance remained strong with over 80% of our
top 30 strategies by revenue in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. We're also seeing good traction with
our expanding suite of passive and active ETFs. We launched the BNY Mellon Responsible Horizons Corporate
Bond ETF managed by Insight and total ETF AUM grew by 8% quarter-over-quarter.
I also want to highlight an exciting new share class for the Dreyfus Government Cash Management Fund called
BOLD. This share class, which provides investors the opportunity to make a direct social impact supporting
Howard University, a historically black college and university, already grew to over $1 billion in AUM within only
weeks of launch at the end of February.
We also continue to be pleased with the healthy growth that we're seeing in Wealth Management. Client
acquisition rates continue trending in the right direction and our improved digital tools and expanded banking
offerings are driving deeper client relationships as evidenced by the solid loan and deposit growth. As an
example, during the quarter, we successfully completed the initial rollout of Loan Path, our new digital platform for
investment credit lines, which allows us to streamline our processes and significantly improve the client
experience at the same time.
Across the franchise, we're honored to have once again been recognized by Fortune for making both its World's
Most Admired Companies in 2022 as well as its Blockchain 50 list, which recognizes 50 companies around the
world for deploying blockchain technology to speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially
save substantial costs for the industry. We're also proud to have been named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable
Companies list, which recognizes the companies that score highest across 230 environment, social and
governance indicators.
Now, before I turn it over to Emily, I'd also like to touch on my decision to retire as CEO on August 31 and the
appointment of Robin as my successor. When I joined BNY Mellon 36 years ago, I was drawn by the company's
rich history, its special culture and the important place it occupies in the global financial system. Over the last four
decades, we have undergone an incredible transformation from the traditional commercial bank that we once
were to the globally significant lower-risk financial services company that we are today.
And I'm particularly proud of what we've accomplished over the last couple of years. With a new leadership team
in place, we launched a compelling agenda for growth and innovation under which we've already seen a

meaningful pick-up in organic growth. We've also really evolved our culture. Today, we're much more
performance-oriented and client-centric, we're more nimble in our decision-making and we're doing a lot better at
connecting the dots across our differentiated businesses.
When our strategic ambitions and the strength of our franchise were tested by the global pandemic, our people
once again rose to the occasion and not only delivered on our commitments to our clients, communities and
shareholders, but we also continued to make significant progress in our journey to position the company for the
future.
In Robin, we have found an outstanding leader to build on this agenda and to lead BNY Mellon into its exciting
next chapter. Having known Robin as a client for almost a decade, I was thrilled to recruit him to the company in
2020 and to work directly with him these last two years. Since then, he has not only had a profound impact on the
company through his leadership of Pershing, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management and our
Markets businesses, but he has been a trusted strategic adviser to me and the rest of the executive management
team. Robin and I are working closely together and with our executive committee to ensure a seamless transition
in the next couple of months.
With that, I'll turn it over to Emily.

Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Todd. And I'll add my congratulations to you, on your retirement, and I want to thank you for your
leadership and mentoring over the years. So, good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our
results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.
Starting on page 3, total revenue was flat and included an approximately $90 million reduction related to Russia, a
notable item this quarter. Fee revenue was down 3%, or flat, excluding the impact related to Russia.
The benefit of higher market values as well as continued momentum across many of our businesses was offset
by the impact of lost business in Pershing and Corporate Trust in the prior year, lower FX revenue off elevated
levels in the first quarter of last year and the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar.
While not on the page, firm-wide AUC/A of $45.5 trillion, increased by 9%, of which 8% is growth from new and
existing clients, and 1% is driven by the impact of higher market values, net of currency headwinds. AUM of $2.3
trillion increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting cumulative net inflows and higher market values, partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar.
Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $199 million in the quarter, an
improvement of $44 million compared to the prior quarter. This reflects the benefit of higher average short-term
interest rates, partially offset by higher money market fund balances.
Once again, our growth in money market fund balances meaningfully outpaced the industry. Together, the impact
of lower waivers and higher balances drove a sequential increase in pre-tax income of close to $60 million. On a
year-over-year basis, fee waivers had a de minimis impact to our fee revenue.
Investment and other revenue was $70 million. Our net interest revenue increased by 7%, reflecting higher
interest rates on interest-earning assets, change in mix and lower funding expense.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Expenses were up about 5.5%, or 6% excluding notable items. Provision for credit losses was $2 million. The
benefit from the continued improvement in the credit portfolio, led by commercial real estate, was more than offset
by a [ph] $15 million (00:14:11) reserve build on interest-bearing deposits with banks in Russia. And our effective
tax rate was approximately 17%, as expected, due to the annual vesting of stock-based awards in the first
quarter, which provided a seasonal benefit. EPS was $0.86 and included an $0.08 negative impact of the notable
item related to Russia. Pre-tax margin and ROTCE were 23% and 15%, respectively, on a reported basis; and
25% and 17%, excluding notable items.
Onto capital and liquidity on page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding
constraint, was 5.3%, down 15 basis points sequentially. The sharp rise in interest rates resulted in a $1.5 billion
impact to unrealized losses in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. And we distributed roughly 60% of our
earnings to our shareholders, predominantly through dividends. The impact of the reduction of capital on our Tier
1 leverage ratio was partially offset by the benefit of a smaller balance sheet quarter-over-quarter.
Our CET1 ratio was 10.1%, down approximately 100 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter,
primarily reflecting the negative mark-to-market of the AFS portfolio as well as an approximately 30-basis-point
impact from the adoption of SA-CCR. Finally, our LCR was 109%, consistent with the prior quarter.
Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page 5, which I will talk about in sequential
terms. Net interest revenue was $698 million, up 3% sequentially. This increase reflects higher rates as well as
continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower cash and securities balances. Average deposit
balances declined by 3%, while average interest-earning assets were down 2% sequentially. Within this, loan
balances were up nicely, about 3% sequentially.
Moving on to expenses on page 6. Expense for the quarter were $3 billion, up about 5.5% year-over-year and up
6% excluding notable items from last year. This increase primarily reflects investments net of efficiency savings,
and it also reflects higher revenue-related expenses, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of the
stronger US dollar.
A few additional details regarding noteworthy quarter-over-quarter expense variances. Staff expense was up 4%,
reflecting the annual vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees. Distribution and
servicing expense was up 5%, reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market funds. And net
occupancy expense was down 8% as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio.
Turning to page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $1.8
billion, flat compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the reduction related to Russia, revenue was up
4%. Fee revenue was down 5% and up 1% excluding the impact of Russia. And net interest revenue was up 6%,
reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
As I discuss the lines of business within our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, I will
focus my comments on the investment services fees for each business, which you can find in our financial
supplement.
In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new
business, partially offset by slightly lower transaction activity from existing clients. As Todd mentioned earlier, our
sales momentum continued to be strong compared to the first quarter of last year.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Our Issuer Services business was significantly impacted by the reduction related to Russia. Investment services
fees were down 43%. Specifically, we accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipt services of
Russian companies, which is a contra revenue item. Excluding this impact, investment services fees were down
approximately 9%, and this primarily reflects lower depositary receipt fees and the impact of lost business in the
prior year in Corporate Trust.
Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.2 billion,
flat compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was also flat. And net interest revenue was up 2%, reflecting higher
interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
In Pershing, investment services fees were down 6%. This reflects the impact of lost business in the prior year as
well as lower transaction activity versus a very active first quarter of last year, partially offset by the impact of
higher market values. Pershing continued to deliver solid underlying growth. Clearing accounts continued to grow
at a 4% annualized growth rate, and we gathered net new assets of $18 billion in the quarter.
In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 4% as the business saw growth from both new and
existing clients and continued to gain traction in higher-margin products such as digital payments.
And in Clearance and Collateral management, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting both higher tri-
party collateral management balances as well as higher clearance volumes.
Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported
total revenue of $964 million, down 3%. Fee revenue was also down 3%. Investment and other revenue was a
negative $8 million and included losses on seed capital. And net interest revenue was up 19%, reflecting higher
interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances.
As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with assets under management of $2.3 trillion, up 2% year-over-year.
This increase primarily reflects the benefit of cumulative net inflows into both cash and long-term products as well
as higher market values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar.
As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $1 billion of net outflows from long-term products and $11 billion of net
outflows from cash. Having said that, LDI continued to be a bright spot with $17 billion of net inflows.
In Investment Management, revenue was down 6%. Higher market values were more than offset by lower seed
capital results and lower equity income as well as the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar, which is more
impactful in Investment Management, given that approximately 50% of our revenue is earned in foreign
currencies.
Wealth Management revenue grew by 4%, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and higher market
values. Client assets of $305 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher markets and cumulative net
inflows. And we continue to see healthy growth in both deposits and loans as we've expanded our banking
offering and deepened our client relationships.
Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment.
I will close with an update on our outlook for the full year of 2022. Obviously, given the backdrop of geopolitical
uncertainty, rapidly evolving global monetary policy and the continued overhang of the pandemic, the
macroeconomic environment is very uncertain.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
For our outlook, we assume a scenario where interest rates follow the forward curve and market values stay
relatively flat to where they were at the end of the first quarter. With this in mind, we project full year NIR to be up
roughly 13% compared to 2021. Embedded in this assumption, we expect the correlation between rates and
deposit runoff to be consistent with what we have seen in the past.
We now expect fee revenue to be up 4% to 5%. This includes a tailwind of about 5% from the reduction of fee
waivers, organic growth of 1% plus and a 1% to 2% headwind from the impact of Russia, market values, currency
and other factors.
For expenses, ex notable items, we now expect an increase of approximately 5%, slightly lower than our previous
guidance.
With regards to capital management, we've taken a number of actions to reposition our portfolio to reduce the
impact of higher rates and credit spreads. For example, we lowered duration in the AFS portfolio, reduced credit
exposure and moved assets to HTM. These actions have reduced our AOCI rate sensitivity by about 25% going
forward. Having said that, we remain cautious on buybacks in the near term. And based on the environment we
described earlier, we ultimately expect to return at least 75% of earnings to shareholders this year. We do
continue to expect to return close to 100% of earnings to our shareholders over time.
Last but not least, we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Brennan Hawken from
UBS. Please go ahead.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, Todd, congrats on your pending retirement and Robin,
congrats on the new role. I look forward to working closer with you. Before a question, though, for Robin, I'd love
to drill down a little bit Emily on what you talked about, more tactically around the actions you've taken with the
balance sheet to reduce the AOCI sensitivity. Could you maybe expand on that a bit and touch on some of the
specific actions in greater detail and what impact we could expect on the outlook for NIR and how that might
inform your updated expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, Brennan, good morning. I'm – just taking a quick step back, I do want to do a shout-out to our CIO, because I
think that team really did do a great job in terms of both optimizing NIR but also protecting against AOCI volatility
during the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks and I'll give a bit more color, we shortened the
duration of the AFS portion of the portfolio. It's now a little over one-and-a-half years, down from more than two
years at the end of last quarter.

We've transferred longer-dated securities to HTM. You'll notice that HTM now as a proportion of the securities
portfolio is about 40%. That's up from about 36% at the end of last year. We've also reduced convexity in credit
risk in the portfolio. And so, all of these things, I mean, we did – obviously, there was a reduction in AOCI of $1.5
billion during the quarter, but it would have been larger had we not taken these actions.
And as you rightfully point out, these actions have also made us a lot less sensitive to rising rates going forward.
And as I also, I think, mentioned, we've reduced – just to put a finer point on it, we've reduced DV01 in the AFS
portfolio in excess of 25% just through the actions that we carried out this quarter. So, as you can tell, we've been
managing the portfolio very actively, we'll continue to monitor it and be very nimble.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that Emily. Robin, maybe one for you. Stepping back and widening out here, understand that
you've just been named to the job, but you're not new to Bank of New York, for sure. So, at this point, can you
provide any details or plans about your goals or targets? Or maybe at least like a roadmap for when we could
expect to hear more from you about your goals and your plans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
President & Chief Executive Officer-Elect, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Good morning, Brennan, and I appreciate the comment and the question. So, you're right. I'm not
completely new to the firm, which is certainly an advantage for me in coming in and taking on the role. But I will
say that I'm being very diligent, as Todd referred to earlier on in his comments, about the transition. And so, we're
working very closely together. And I don't want to be complacent about the fact that there's a great opportunity for
a CEO-elect to have the opportunity to come in and to really benefit from a transition.
Having said all of that, when I joined the firm, I was really struck by the breadth of the franchise. I mean, 93% of
the world's top investment managers are clients of ours – as are 97% of the world's top 100 banks. And that
breadth, coupled with the depth of the franchise, that real client trust that we've talked about before is a super
powerful foundation. And so, job number one for me is to really build on that. And that's been an investment that
Todd has been very focused on during his time as CEO.
Now, what I also would reflect on is some of the things that I've been focused on in the Market and Wealth
Services businesses. And the first of those is innovation. You've seen that we've launched Pershing X. We've
been very focused on real-time payments in the Treasury Services space. And that concept of really driving
innovation across the enterprise is another important pillar of how I think about the firm and the opportunity that's
ahead of us.
Another thing that we've been doing in that segment, which I'm very excited about across the company, is really
deepening the wallet, connecting the dots across the firm, helping clients that are existing clients of the firm to do
more with us. And that whole ethos of ONE BNY Mellon, I think is a real important and deep vein for us to
continue to mine.
And then the last point that I'd mention is operating leverage and focus on margins. In that segment, we had a
41% margin in the first quarter. And having run operational businesses in the past, I'm very focused on operating
leverage, and that will continue to be a focus of mine along with these other pillars. So, that's how I'm thinking
about the world. But I'd just remind you that I'm still in the transition and enjoying working with Todd, and we're
really focused on making this a smooth and effective handover.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. What I was going to ask you, Robin, I asked that at the shareholder meeting, but maybe just a little bit more
about your background. I just say that when Northern changed their CEO, they said "the old CEO is more about
marketing and I'm more about numbers." When State Street changed their CEO, they said, "well, the new CEO
was more about understanding asset management and their clients." Anything else – since we don't know you as
well as Todd, who's been there for – in his fourth decade, anything else about your background that you could
share that could give investors confidence as you are about to enter the CEO role in several months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
President & Chief Executive Officer-Elect, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Mike. Well, I'm all about being a great all-around CEO. But to answer the sort of question a bit more directly
in terms of my background, I feel like I've been prepared for this role over the course of my career. I started off in
the Markets business, and I ran the Money Markets business at my prior organization, which was a great
opportunity to really get into the markets, capital markets, interest rates and really the client franchise. And of
course, a lot of those same clients are clients of ours and so that was a great formative start for me.
I ran operations at my prior firm. I was a Treasurer. I was the Chief Risk Officer. I was the CEO of the international
bank. I operated internationally. And so when I put all of that together, I think it really gives me the opportunity,
having touched a lot of different aspects of our franchise and our activities, to really bring all of that to bear in the
role going forward. And I'm very excited about that. And as I joined the firm, as I commented before, I've been
struck by a few things, including the depth and breadth of the franchise, but also the culture of the firm. And I think
that there's a lot of opportunity for us, and I'm excited to have at it.

And so, to summarize, you kind of want to have like ONE BNY Mellon and improve the wallet share. And
hopefully, I'm not sure if you guys can give this now. I don't think so, Todd. There's not too many firms that do it.
But what's your market share by large client, where was it a few years ago? And where do you hope it to be? Do
you have any metrics around that? Or do you think we can get that in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. We haven't disclosed that publicly, but what I would say is we have grown with our clients, and we have
continued to increase market share with our largest clients over the past couple of years, especially in our
Servicing business – our Asset Servicing business. And I think some of the stats that we even did disclose this
morning that Emily mentioned, we retained – actually, I mentioned that, we retained 97% of all of the business
that we rebid on, which is an enormously high number.
And we've got some capabilities, I mean the investments that we've made in service quality and some of that is in
some of the technology that we've got around that, keeping us much closer to our clients, much better informed,
much more responsive. The investments that we've made in our data management and data analytics, where I
think we are the leader, not only in the servicing capabilities, but also the fact that we can – we've got the ability to
bundle all of the back-office services, not just custody and accounting and administration, but TA as well is a
differentiator. So, I think we are seeing increased market share. I haven't disclosed it specifically against the major
clients. But I think the fact that we are with just about every one of the major clients reflects that.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning everyone. Emily, wanted to ask you a little bit on net interest income and some of the
changes that you're referencing. So, I guess to start, can you help us understand your point about historical
reference of deposits versus QT or rates environment? We saw deposits come down this quarter. Can you tell us
what you're expecting to see out of the balance sheet going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, when it comes to deposits and runoff, what I'd first say is that we're just using the forward curve. So,
assume that it's just as baked into the forward curve, Fed funds is about 2.5% by the end of the year. Also, we're
just assuming that betas largely retrace what we've seen in the last cycle. It means that we will get to the end
state faster, but they're going to largely retrace, it's correlated to rates and largely retrace what we've already
seen.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
So, with all that said, we would expect deposits to probably run off maybe about 10% over the course of this year.
And that's from where we are in the average of the first quarter. We've already seen them come down a bit from
the fourth quarter.
And just as a reminder, our deposit base is largely institutional, NIBs. Part of the growth you've seen has been in
NIBs and so we expect that to kind of normalize too over time. And the other thing I would mention is that as we
see deposit run off, we also could see a migration to money market funds. And if that does indeed happen, then
obviously, that could be a nice tailwind for us as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the shortening up of the duration, can you tell us how – I don't know if you can
size the magnitude of how much that might have changed your current views of full year NII up 13% versus what
it might have been otherwise? And how you're now redirecting incremental cash flows into the portfolio versus
what you might have done otherwise, if rates haven't gone up this quickly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. We are – we've obviously shortened duration across the portfolio. We've swapped fixed to floating. And
considering just the uncertain environment, we're also continuing to be cautious and nimble.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then you mentioned the more cautious on buybacks in the near term and maybe returning 75% this
year. How will you evaluate that? Obviously, we can do math on what it means for this year. But in terms of how
much could the swings in AOCI continue to impact even being able to do 75%? Thanks, Emily.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, as I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we still intend to return 100% of our earnings to our
shareholders over time, and that's, of course, across dividends and buybacks. We've been cautious, and I think
it's been appropriate to be somewhat defensive in this environment with the uncertainty and, of course, the
reduction in AOCI, but given the assumptions in our forecast, we feel pretty confident that we would expect to
return at least 75% of our earnings to our shareholders over this year. And the nice thing about SCB and the SCB
framework is that we can be nimble, we can be flexible. And ultimately, depending upon the runoff we see we
might be able to do more.

Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on the NII guidance. I appreciate the color, Emily, on the
deposit balance trajectory based on what we experienced last cycle. I was hoping you could just speak to the
deposit beta assumptions underpinning the guidance for the full year? And also, how much of a helper was
premium amortization this quarter and how much of a benefit, do you expect to realize over the course of the
remainder of this year?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So from a beta perspective, as I said before, we just expect betas to largely retrace what we've seen historically. It
does mean you'll get to the end state faster. In the first rate rise, it's generally – and what we've experienced, it's
very much as we've been expecting in line with expectations, kind of betas of 35% to 40%. By the time we kind of
get towards year-end and we have many more rate hikes that will be probably closer to – betas would be closer to
70-plus-percent, which is kind of where we ended in the last rate cycle.
In terms of – what was your last – sorry, I missed the second part of the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Sorry, the premium amortization...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Oh, premium am. Yeah. It was helpful. This quarter I don't have it right off hand. But it was obviously – definitely
helpful this quarter, but – and we just expect it with rates rising as we go forward, it will continue to be a bit
helpful, but frankly, at a more modest level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And maybe just switching over to the fee side, you spoke to fee revenue up 4% to 5%. I believe,
Emily, and I'm sorry if I missed this, you alluded to organic growth of 1%-plus being the underlying assumption. I
know you had been running at 2%-plus of late. I wanted to get a sense, is that organic growth guide more a
reflection of conservatism, challenging macro or just what you're actually seeing in the backlog of new mandates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's definitely not so much on – at all on the mandate side. We still – fundamentally, our businesses are in really
good health. The growth is really – just considering the more challenging environment that we're in. And
specifically, when you look at market levels or client activity across some businesses have slowed down, you're
seeing or we're expecting a bit more risk-off behavior. And so the particular businesses, which are probably most
– which are going to be most impacted, we think, are Investment Management, Corporate Trust, Depositary
Receipts, to a lot lesser extent, Asset Servicing. And so that's what's all baked into the 1-plus-percent guide. But
the fundamentals are very good. And we feel pretty good about that considering the challenging environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
I couldn't agree more. And just one follow-up, ticky-tack modeling question. Just on the Asset Servicing line, I
believe in the slides you flagged a gain on strategic equity investment. I was hoping that you could size that for
us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
We don't disclose that in – we don't disclose that (sic) [discrete] item.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I would just add to that, Emily. So if you look at our investment and other income, it was about in line with
the guidance that we had given. On the Asset Servicing, we do have some investments that we've said in some
FinTechs that we work very closely with strategically and they've performed pretty well. But as you might imagine,
in this down cycle in the first quarter, we got hit pretty hard in our seed capital and some of our other things. So
net-net, they basically offset each other.

Operator: We will now take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats again to both Todd and Robin here.
So my first question is around the kind of connectivity between organic growth and operating leverage in the
business. So organic growth sounds like 1-ish-percent this year. Fees were flattish year-over-year. Expenses up
5%. Right?
So I understand that there's, obviously, investments that you guys are making in the business. But when you think
about this on a – 18 to 24 months out, should we expect BK to get to a point where fee growth is more in line with
expense growth? I think this kind of dovetails maybe some of Robin's comments earlier around his focus on
operating leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So what I would say is, look, we are very focused on driving positive operating leverage. And I just would remind
you that overall, for – if you look at our total revenues, we will be – our plan is to deliver positive operating
leverage this year. And frankly, that's with the impact of the Russia notable items. So I think that's pretty good.
In terms of fee – when we think about just fee revenue versus expenses, what I would say is that when you look
at our – the guide that we gave for the rest of the year, it does – our expense guide does include slightly more
inflationary pressures as well as the investments, of course, that we've talked about extensively that we think are
very compelling and some will pay off sooner and some will pay off a bit over the course of the next couple of
years. And as we talked about, it's way too early to kind of talk about like what it's going to look like in, say, 24
months, 36 months out. But we have said that, ultimately, over time, we would expect expense growth, the rate of
growth to moderate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
All right. We'll stay tuned for that. My second question around maybe the Issuer Services business and really DR
specifically. I think in the earlier release when you guys announced the Russia loss this quarter, there's a
comment there around just a more subdued level of revenue growth. I think there's an ongoing effect from the
Russia exited business as well. Can you just level set us what the DR business does in revenues now per year

kind of net of these changes on a run rate basis? And then ultimately, how should we think about any other sort of
geopolitical risk within that business? I don't know to what extent China is part of that revenue stream? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Emily, you want me to take it or you want it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I think there's a couple of questions there. So Russia was a – it was a material component of the total DR
revenue. And the indication that we gave is there was a contra hit on kind of prepaid expenses there. So that got
reversed in the first quarter, and that was the most of the $88 million that we were talking about. And on a go-
forward basis, we'd expect probably something like $20 million – probably $15 million a quarter specifically from
DRs.
There are – China is an important market to us, too. So we saw – what we have seen, Alex, is a little bit of – fewer
transactions. Fewer new issuance in China, a little bit down, and that's reflected in those numbers. We don't break
out the entire DR revenue line. It's a smaller – a modest percentage of the total Issuer Services. But it is impactful
and it did – as you can see, it hit the bottom line in the first quarter.

Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just a question on the Pershing X initiative that was announced a few months ago. Wondering if you could dig in
more on what specific areas you're looking to grow in and help us size the investment dollars, timing and the ROI
of the investments here and any expected impact on margins. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
President & Chief Executive Officer-Elect, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Ryan. So look, it's an investment that we're excited about. As we step back from our Pershing business,
where as you know, we're a real market leader in that business. We touch about 15% of RIA accounts in the US.
We touch a little over 30% of all RIAs with $1 billion or more in AUM.
One of the things that we've heard from our clients is that the world is getting increasingly complex for them as
they think about how to really pull all of the capabilities that they need to run their businesses together. And as
we've really listened to our customers on that point, we decided that there was a great opportunity for us to help
solve some of those problems. And so collecting the various different capabilities, focusing on the data and the
smooth movement of data across those various capabilities, we saw that as an opportunity to really deliver
something new and incremental to our customer base.
And we've tried to speed our way along that. We hired, as you know, Ainslie Simmonds to run that for us. She's
recently completed the rounding out of her top leadership team. We tried to speed our way to market with the
acquisition of a direct indexing capability in the fourth quarter, Optimal Asset Management. That was an example
of a bolt-on capability that we think can just help us to accelerate.
But as we've disclosed before, we're not expecting this to drop much to the bottom line over the course of the next
couple of years. This is an investment in positioning Pershing and the aggregate wealth management services
platform for the future. And so this is an investment in the medium to long term, we think it's important. Our
customers very much want it, and we're excited for it.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Well, first of all, congrats again, Todd and Robin. And Robin, looking forward to working with you. The first
question is just on the short-term second quarter outlook. I know Emily, you gave the outlook for the full year.
Maybe just to focus a little bit on the pace coming into the second quarter on the recoupment of fee waivers, and
any commentary on the sort of near-term trajectory of NIR for the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. We really decided to do more of a full year guide versus second quarter. But to size what you're thinking
about and I think specifically on waivers, if we do see the Fed raise rates by 50 basis points in May, as I think
we're all kind of expecting, obviously, that will be a nice uptick in terms of recouping waivers. And it's to the tune
of, call it, like $100 million or so is what I – is how I'd estimate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then to focus a little bit longer-term on the organic revenue growth outlook, the 1%-plus. Just, I guess if
we do get a better – let's say, if we get a risk-on backdrop in the second half as opposed to the current sort of
view of a challenging market backdrop, how might that influence that organic revenue growth outlook? Is that
enough to put you back in that 2% area or do you really – there's a lot of things you're working on to really build
that organically? And if you can just remind us the sensitivity of fee revenue to equity markets – global equity
markets improvement. And then just lastly, whether you would be considering any type of major acquisitions to
accelerate revenue growth, or really it's just going to be a focus on organic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I'll take a couple of parts to that, and Todd or Robin might want to chime in about the inorganic opportunities.
But in terms of organic growth, just remember, when we define organic growth, we are normalizing for market
appreciation or depreciation, but it is fair that risk-on or risk-off behavior associated with that could also impact
organic growth. And so what I would say is it's hard, we don't really say like what's the sensitivity. But yeah, there
certainly could be more upside if you see more risk-on behavior and, ultimately, that means more trading, more
transaction volume, et cetera. So that is upside. So it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility that it could be
higher.
In terms of – what was your second...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
The equity – the fee revenue sensitivity to – so like every 10% increase in equity market...

Good morning. I just wanted to ask about – start with the average loans were up 3% sequentially and 18% year-
over-year. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about where you're seeing the strongest demand? And what are your
expectations moving forward and the ability to meet that demand just given the expected trajectory of the deposit
balances from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So actually, we've been very proactively growing the loan portfolio. So yes, as you mentioned, it's up 3% on
average and 18% year-on-year. We will continue – it's our expectation to continue to grow that over the course of
this year. And where we're seeing it is really on a couple of different areas. So capital call facilities, certainly, trade
finance, likewise, margin loans, CCLs and mortgages in Wealth, so that's pretty much across the board. And
that's – we want to be there and leverage our balance sheet for our clients when it makes sense.

Okay. Thank you, Emily. And then just thinking about the capital ratios today and your comment on returning 75%
of net income, any thoughts on the trajectory in terms of the quarterly pace, just given that the Tier 1 leverage is

at 5.3% or you ended the quarter at 5.3%. It seems like the buybacks may need to be a bit more back-half
weighted as the capital ratios kind of accrete higher from here. Is that a fair expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I'm not going to really comment on kind of how it's going to be paced throughout the year. I think you can kind of
look at all of our ratios and make your own assumptions. But – and the thing I would just remind everyone again is
that the SCB framework is – really allows us to be very nimble and very flexible.

Operator: We will now take our final question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Emily, can you share with us – and if it's not available, maybe you could
answer it in a different way. But in your quarterly and 10-Ks, you and your peers always give us 100 basis point
parallel shift in the curve leads to an X percent increase or decrease in net interest revenue. How does that – how
do you stand today at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the fourth quarter? Do you have that number?
And if you don't, will it be lower by 30% or 40% compared to the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's – we don't – we will obviously be updating that when we release the Q. What I would say is we're much more
sensitive, of course, to short-term rates than long-term rates. That continues, of course, to be the case. And you'll
see more of that when we actually release the Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very good. And then following up on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, I think last quarter you mentioned that you
guys are trying to manage to 5.5%. Obviously, you're slightly below that today. Where do you think – how low can
it go from where we are today or just your views on how you're managing that number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So in terms of Tier 1 leverage, we've always said that, given the extraordinary circumstances we're in and all of
the excess liquidity in the system that we would be – it makes perfect sense to dip into our buffer to a degree,
which is what we've done. We would expect, of course, as we start to see some probably deposit runoffs that, that
will take a lot of pressure off Tier 1 leverage.

And what I'd also just flag is that by the end of the year, it's not – it's likely actually not out of the realm of
possibility, but frankly, probably likely that our binding constraint will become CET1 versus Tier 1 leverage. And
frankly, I think if you're toggling between Tier 1 and – Tier 1 leverage and CET1, that actually is very good. It
means you're managing your balance sheet optimally.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then just quickly, on the HTM, I think you said you lifted your HTM portfolio to 40% of total securities.
Is there a limit on how high you would take that to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
There isn't a limit per se, but we obviously do that very – with our partners in Risk, and we're always making sure
that whatever we move there is high-quality liquid assets that generally speaking, you can repo it – repo those
assets, et cetera. So I wouldn't expect it to increase a lot more from here.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Gerard, it's Todd. I'll follow up. I just want to add to – Emily made, I think, all the right points around the
capital ratios and the Tier 1 leverage. But remember, we're probably too precise when we give you a number of
something like 5.50. If you remember, that's a 150 basis point buffer to what the requirement is.
And the reason it's there is because we recognize that you could have a spike in the balance sheet. And for us,
it's not a risk spike, it's because deposits have increased, and we've certainly seen that through the quantitative
easing over the past couple of years or you can have a sell-off and some impact in the OCI. That's exactly why
the buffer is there. So eating into the buffer in this type of situation is exactly what we would expect. And it's not
really particularly constraining to us as we still have that 130 basis points.
To Emily's point and in our modeling, if things run the way we would expect them off of the forward curve, those
deposits are going to come down 10% or so, and that's going to free up quite a bit of Tier 1 leverage. Basically –
and we're estimating that we're going to get pretty close to common equity Tier 1, which is a great place to be.
And it also means common equity is a little easier to manage because that's a risk-based asset ratio where we
can manage. It's not just what comes on to the balance sheet. So, I want to make that clear. Probably in the
future, we should give you guidelines that are more ranges, and we can kind of calculate where we are in the
range.
