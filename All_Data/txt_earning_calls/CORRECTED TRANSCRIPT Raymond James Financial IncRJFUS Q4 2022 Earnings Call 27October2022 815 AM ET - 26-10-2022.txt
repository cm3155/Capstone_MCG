Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings, I
want to start by acknowledging the heartbreaking devastation our friends and neighbors, as well as over 200
associates on Florida's Central Gulf Coast, experienced a month ago from Hurricane Ian. While it has been
difficult to bear witness to their pain and loss, I also have been humbled by the resilience of our associates,
advisors and the community there. Fortunately, our Raymond James family impacted by the storm is safe.
Just as notable, I can't adequately express my gratitude for our Tampa Bay Area associates, who, despite facing
an uncertain path from a Category 4 hurricane, worked diligently from remote locations to continue delivering our
service first promise. Additionally, our associates at our corporate locations in Memphis, in Southfield and Denver
rose to the occasion, covering for their coworkers and pitching in where they could and working weekends to
catch up.
For those without power or other hardships, the home office was open to provide a comfortable and clean place to
go. When the home office reopened, the camaraderie was obvious and uplifting. We provided emotional and
mental health resources to associates, delivered a $500 relief check to all associates in impacted counties, and
provided additional time-off to help them manage their personal situations.
Associates collected two semi-trucks of supplies which were sent to our Fort Myers branch system to be
distributed by advisors and associates in their areas. We've heard several heartwarming stories from recipients of
these essential supplies which in itself shows how the collective efforts and generosity truly made a difference for
those who needed it most.
The firm also responded by raising more than $1 million from corporate, executive leadership and associate
donations to assist the recovery and support of those in need through the Red Cross and our friends at Raymond
James Charity who directly help associates with needed emergency funds for repairs and recovery. If I sound
surprised, I'm not. The preparation, perseverance and response to the storm reflected the long history of
Raymond James service culture, and I'm especially proud to represent our team today.
Now moving to our results. I'm very pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given
the challenging market conditions. Despite the significant decline in equity markets during the year, we still
generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Throughout the
fiscal year, we remain focused on the long term and continued to invest in our businesses, our people and our
technology to help drive growth across our businesses. In the Private Client Group, strong retention and recruiting

of financial advisors contributed to industry-leading growth, with domestic net new assets of 9% over the fiscal
year. Furthermore, the Charles Stanley acquisition completed earlier in the year significantly expanded our
presence in the UK, which is a very attractive market for wealth management.
In Capital Markets, annual investment banking results were very strong, only 3% lower than the record results
achieved in fiscal 2021. Record M&A revenues help offset the very challenging underwriting environment. We
continue to see strong pipelines through M&A, as the expertise we've added both organically and through niche
acquisitions has been performing extremely well.
We completed the acquisition of SumRidge Partners on July 1, which has enhanced our fixed income platform
with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience dealing with corporates. This
business thrives on rate volatility, so SumRidge generated really fantastic results since we closed on the
acquisition in July. However, after a record year last year, our legacy fixed income operations serving depositories
has been challenged as the Fed intensifies its monetary tightening initiatives.
In the Bank segment, loans grew 73% year-over-year and 3% during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth
across nearly all loan categories. The acquisition of TriState Capital Bank this year added a best-in-class third-
party securities-based lending capability while also diversifying our funding sources. It is in uncertain conditions
such as these that reminds us the importance of focusing on and making decisions for the long term.
As evidenced this quarter with the sharp increase in net interest income and RJBDP fees, we are well positioned
for the continued rise in short-term interest rates, with diverse and ample funding sources, strong loan growth,
high concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios, which are
well in excess of regulatory requirements. While some of these attributes may be underappreciated in certain
market cycles, the value of our long-term approach has really resonated in more volatile and uncertain market
environment we've experienced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the fiscal fourth quarter, the firm reported record net revenues of $2.83 billion, record pre-tax income of $616
million and net income available to common shareholders of $437 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.98.
Net income was negatively impacted by the elevated tax rates this quarter due primarily to non-deductible losses
on corporate-owned life insurance that we utilized to fund non-qualified benefit plans.
Excluding $30 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common
shareholders was $459 million or $2.08 per diluted share. Year-over-year and sequential revenue growth was
driven primarily by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on both RJBDP fees from third-party banks and
net interest income, which more than offset the declines in asset management and related administrative fees and
total brokerage revenue, largely due to decline in equity markets.
Quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 2% compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth
quarter, reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth, which was partially offset by higher non-compensation
expenses and higher tax rate. Sequentially, quarterly net income grew 46%, driven primarily by the benefit from
higher short-term interest rates to the net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, along with
lower bank loan provision for credit losses as the prior quarter included the $26 million initial provision for credit
losses on loans arising from the acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings. Annualized return on common equity for
the quarter was 18.7% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, an impressive
result, especially given the challenging market environment and our strong capital position.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Moving to slide 5. We ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of $1.09 trillion, PCG assets
in fee-based accounts of $586 billion and financial assets under management of $174 billion. Equity market
declines in the quarter, including a 5% sequential decline in the S&P 500 Index, negatively impacted client asset
levels. We ended the quarter with 8,681 financial advisors in PCG, a net increase of 199 over the prior year
period and 65 over the preceding quarter.
And remember, the year-over-year increase, the advisor count was impacted by transition of advisors to our RIA
& Custody Service (sic) [RIA & Custody Services] (00:11:15) division, where we typically retain the assets but we
don't include the advisor in our accounts. In the fiscal year, we had 222 financial advisors moved to RCS, 166 of
which came from one firm. Adjusting for these transfers, the numbers of financial advisors increased 421 year-
over-year, a really strong result. Our focus on supporting advisors and their clients, especially during uncertain
and volatile markets, led us to strong results in terms of advisor retention, as well as our recruiting of experienced
advisors to the Raymond James platforms through our multiple affiliation options.
Over the trailing 12-month period ending September 30, 2022, we recruited to our domestic independent
contractor and employee channels financial advisors with nearly $320 million of trailing 12 production and
approximately $43 billion of client assets at their previous firms. And highlighting our industry-leading growth, we
generated domestic PCG net new assets of nearly $95 billion over the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022,
representing 9% of domestic client assets at the beginning of the period. Fourth quarter domestic PCG net new
assets growth was 8.3% annualized.
Total client domestic cash sweep balances declined 12% to $67.1 billion, or 7% of domestic PCG assets under
administration. Paul Shoukry will discuss this more later. But I'd like to highlight that these are lower-cost deposits,
as we have not yet utilized high-yield savings accounts to preserve balances. Total bank loans grew 3%
sequentially to a record $43.2 billion, reflecting attractive broad-based growth at both Raymond James Bank and
TriState Capital Bank.
Moving to slide 6. The Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $1.99 billion
and pre-tax income of $371 million. While asset-based revenues declined, the segment's results were lifted by the
benefit from both higher short-term interest rates.
The Capital Markets segment generate quarterly net revenues of $399 million and pre-tax income of $66 million.
Capital Market (sic) [Capital Markets] (00:13:57) revenues declined 28% compared to the prior year period,
mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues and fixed income brokerage revenues, largely due to the
volatile and uncertain markets.
The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $216 million and pre-tax income of $83 million. The
declines in revenues and pre-tax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under management, as
net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by fixed income and equity market
declines.
The Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank, generated quarterly net
revenue of $428 million, which is a record result, and pre-tax income of $123 million. Net revenue growth was
mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the bank's net interest margin to 2.91% for the
quarter, up 50 basis points in the preceding quarter, once again reflecting the flexibility and floating rate nature of
our balance sheet. This quarter also included a full quarter of TriState Capital results, which have continued to be
solid.

Looking at the full year fiscal 2022 results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $11 billion and record
pre-tax income of $2 billion, both up 13% over fiscal 2021. Record earnings per diluted share of $6.98 increased
5% compared to fiscal 2021. Additionally, we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17% and
annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21.1%.
Moving to the fiscal year segment results on slide 8. Private Client Group, Asset Management and Bank
segments generated record net revenues and the Private Client Group produced record pre-tax income during the
fiscal year, again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
And now for more detailed review of the fiscal fourth quarter results, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul
Shoukry. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on slide 10. Record quarterly net revenues of $2.83 billion
grew 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Asset management fees declined 6% compared to the prior year's
fiscal fourth quarter and 10% compared to the preceding quarter, in line with the guidance we provided on last
quarter's call based on fee-based assets.
Equity markets declined further during the quarter, resulting in a 3% sequential decline in Private Client Group
assets in fee-based accounts. This decline will create a headwind for asset management and related
administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter, which I expect to be down close to 4% sequentially in the fiscal first
quarter of 2023.
Brokerage revenues of $481 million declined 11% compared to the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter and 6%
compared to the preceding quarter, as lower activity and asset-based trail revenues in PCG, as well as decreased
fixed income brokerage revenues more than offset the addition of SumRidge, which generated strong revenues in
the quarter.
As Paul touched on, we expect this to be a tough environment for our legacy fixed income business as depository
clients have quickly transitioned from having excess deposits to invest in securities to experiencing deposit runoff
as a result of the Fed's actions.
I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $217 million
declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter, a solid result given the challenging and uncertain market
environment. And while our pipelines are strong, there remains a lot of uncertainty given the heightened market
volatility that could impact investment banking revenues positively or negatively in the coming quarters. Therefore,
our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar level of average quarterly investment banking
revenues in fiscal 2023 that we experienced over the last two quarters.
Obviously, a lot of variables can and probably will impact that estimate, but that would result in a 20% decline in
investment banking revenues in fiscal 2023. That would still represent a much higher level of investment banking
revenues than we generated prior to the pandemic as we have made significant investments to the platform over
the past few years, which has significantly increased our productive capacity and market share. Other revenues of
$80 million grew 167% sequentially, primarily due to higher affordable housing investment business revenues,
which achieved record results in fiscal 2022.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $67.1 billion, down 12%
compared to the preceding quarter and representing 7% of domestic PCG client assets. As of this week, these
balances have declined to just under $64 billion, reflecting the quarterly fee payments which were paid in October,
as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month.
When comparing trends across the industry, it is important to note that these cash sweep balances do not include
high-yield savings balances, nor do we have a money market sweeps option. So it is sometimes difficult to make
apples-to-apples comparisons across the industry. Most of the decline in our sweep balances were experienced
in the Client Interest Program at the broker-dealer, which was really the last-in, first-out destination of the excess
deposits over the past couple of years. As we have been explaining for at least a year now, we anticipated a
significant decline in these cash balances as the Fed started increasing short-term interest rates. So we kept the
CIP balances invested in deposit accounts and short-term treasuries.
The Raymond James Bank Deposit sweep program continues to be a relatively low-cost source of stable funding.
And now, with the addition of TriState Capital Bank's independent deposit franchise, we have a more diversified
funding base. And while this additional funding source may not have seen this valuable several months ago, I
think everyone now appreciates just how precious deposits are and the importance of having multiple funding
sources.
Turning to slide 12. Combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $606 million, up
206% over the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter and 64% from the preceding quarter. This strong growth reflects
the immediate impact from higher short-term rates, given the limited duration and high concentration of floating
rate assets on our balance sheet. While it can sometimes seem appropriate to take more duration and bet on
rates, our long-standing approach to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets is proving to be a
significant tailwind in this rising rate environment.
You can see on the bottom portion of the slide, the Bank segment's net interest margin increased a substantial 50
basis points sequentially to 2.91% for the quarter. And that's on top of the 40-basis-point sequential increase in
NIM in the preceding quarter. The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased nearly 100
basis points to 1.85%. Both the NIM and average yield from third-party banks are expected to increase further
with the anticipated rate increases.
For the fiscal first quarter, factoring in an expected 75-basis-point rate increase in November and some
assumptions around deposit beta and other variables, we would expect the average yield on RJBDP from third-
party banks for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 to be somewhere around 2.5% and the Bank segment's NIM to
average around 3.15%. But these projections will obviously be impacted by the actual deposit beta we
experience.
As we have done this cycle, we will continue to put clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of
the spectrum for our clients. So far, the cumulative deposit beta since the Fed started increasing rates in March
has been around 25%, with the most recent increase in September having a deposit beta of about 35%, less than
the 50% we expected, but still much more generous to clients than the vast majority of our competitors.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Beginning with our largest expense, compensation. The total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 62.1%, which decreased from 67.5% in the preceding quarter. The
adjusted compensation ratio was 61.5% during the quarter. The sequential decline in the compensation ratio
largely reflects a significant benefit from higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks.

Non-compensation expenses of $456 million, which includes [ph] $13 million (00:24:36) of acquisition-related
expenses included in our non-GAAP earnings adjustments, decreased 3% sequentially. This quarter reflected a
full quarter of expenses for both TriState Capital and SumRidge Partners, which sequentially added just over $25
million of incremental non-compensation expenses, excluding the bank loan loss provision for credit losses.
The bank loan loss provision for credit losses decreased to $34 million, primarily due to the $26 million initial
provision associated with the TriState Capital acquisition in the fiscal third quarter. This quarter's bank loan
provision primarily reflects sequential loan growth, along with a weaker macroeconomic outlook used in the CECL
models. So as you can see, we remain focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non-
compensation-related expenses while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors
and their clients.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated a
pre-tax margin of 21.8% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 22.8%, really excellent results. And just to get ahead
of it, I know many of you will ask me if we will update our 19% to 20% pre-tax margin target that we laid out at our
Analyst and Investor Day in May since we exceeded it this quarter, while that is certainly a reasonable ask, given
the market uncertainty and ongoing cash sorting dynamic, we think it's appropriate to wait at least a few more
months to update all of our targets. But with that being said, I think our solid results this quarter highlight the
benefit of our diversified business model, the upside we preserve to higher short-term interest rates and our
consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses.
On slide 15, at quarter-end, total assets were $81 billion, a 6% sequential decrease, primarily reflecting the
decline in the Client Interest Program cash balances I mentioned earlier. Liquidity and capital remained very
strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.9 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. The
Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.3% and total capital ratio of 20.5% are both more than double the regulatory
requirements to be well capitalized. [indiscernible] (00:27:42) Tier 1 leverage ratio at the end of the quarter is
actually closer to 10.5%. So our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being
opportunistic and invest in growth.
The effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 28.7%, up from 27.5% in the preceding quarter, primarily due to
non-deductible losses on the corporate-owned life insurance portfolio. Going forward, we still believe around 24%
to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in your models. But in rapidly declining equity markets, the effective tax
rate increases as we experience this quarter and last quarter and vice versa when equity markets increase.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. Since the closing of the TriState
acquisition on June 1 through October 26, we have repurchased approximately 2.1 million common shares for
$200 million, or approximately $96 per share under our board authorization. As of October 26, 2022,
approximately $800 million remained available under the board-approved share repurchase authorization, which
we typically revisit annually in the upcoming board meeting.
We remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of TriState, as well as a share-
based compensation dilution. Therefore, we expect to repurchase on average $250 million per quarter in fiscal
2023 or $1 billion total for the fiscal year. Of course, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and
other capital and cash needs as we plan for these repurchases over the coming quarters, but I do want to
emphasize this $1 billion objective for fiscal 2023.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which now includes Raymond James
Bank and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains healthy, with most trends

continuing to improve. Criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just
1.14%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the
quarter at 0.91%, down from 1.27% at September of 2021 and nearly flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline
in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment largely reflects the
higher proportion of security-based loans boosted by the acquisition of TriState Capital Bank.
Securities-based loans which account for approximately 35% of net loans are generally collateralized by
marketable securities and therefore typically do not require an allowance for credit losses. If you look at the bank
loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans held for investment as a percentage of the total corporate
loans, it was 1.73% at quarter-end. Compared to most other banks, we believe this represents a healthy reserve
but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints and a potential
recession on our corporate loan portfolio.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I stated at the start of our call, I am pleased with our results. And while there are many
uncertainties, I believe we are well positioned to drive growth across all of our businesses. In the Private Client
Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 4% sequential decline of asset
management fees and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier.
Focusing more on the long term, I'm optimistic we'll continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and
prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and production solutions.
Additionally, the segment will also continue to benefit from higher short-term interest rates, although we expect
cash sorting will continue as the Fed increases short-term interest rates.
In the Capital Markets segment, the M&A pipeline remains strong, but the pace and timing of closings will be
heavily influenced by market conditions. Over the long term, I am confident we are well positioned for growth
given the significant investments we've made over the past five years.
In the fixed income space, the favorable environment we've experienced over the past couple of years has
shifted. Depository clients, once flush with cash and facing limited opportunity for loan growth, are now
experiencing declines in deposits and have less cash available for investing in securities. This dynamic will lead to
a challenging environment for fiscal 2023. While this headwind exists, we expect SumRidge Partners to enhance
our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace, and SumRidge
typically benefits from elevated rate volatility.
In the Asset Management segment, the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal year lower due
to the decline in equity and fixed income markets. However, we are confident that strong growth of assets in fee-
based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under
management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management, formerly Carillon Tower
Associates (sic) [Carillon Tower Advisers] (00:34:01), to help drive further growth through increased scale,
distribution, operational and marketing synergies.
The Bank segment is well positioned for rising short-term interest rates, and we have ample funding and capital to
grow the balance sheet prudently. We will continue to operate TriState Capital Bank as a separately chartered

bank and respect its relationships with its clients, which coupled with our strong capital and funding should foster
its ongoing growth. Most importantly, the credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains strong.
As always, I want to thank all of our advisors and associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing
excellent service to their clients each and every day. Just as you've observed over the past two years, which have
been filled with tremendous uncertainty and challenges, we will stay rooted in our commitment to take care of
advisors and clients, making decisions for the long-term and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. We
believe with this approach we should be able to continue delivering strong results through different market
environments and drive results for our associates, advisors and shareholders, just as we have for the past 60
years.
With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions.

Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead.

Hi, Manan.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I was wondering – good morning. Hey. I was wondering, can you talk about what your assumptions are for
deposit betas in your NIM guidance for next quarter, because it looks like, even with the 75-basis-point increase in
the Fed funds rate in November and a significantly higher average Fed funds rate next quarter versus the prior
quarter, I think you guided your NIM rising only 25 basis points or so. So I guess the question is, what are you
baking in for deposit betas and is there some element of conservatism embedded in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
As you know, Manan, we do like to provide conservative guidance, and that 3.15% admittedly is somewhat
conservative. It's only factoring in the November increase and the market's obviously expecting a December
increase as well. And so, SOFR tends to lead those type of increases as we saw last quarter. So, we had 50-
basis-point sequential increase two quarters ago in the NIM, 40 basis points this quarter and we're guiding 25

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
We were expecting deposit beta as rates kind of continue to increase to get closer to 50%. On the last
incremental increase for us, it was 35% and cumulatively, it was 25%. And we've been really leading most of the
industry focusing on clients and sharing and being generous with clients as the rates have increased. And so,
going forward, 50%, frankly, might be too conservative as well just because of when you look at competitors,
we're certainly well ahead of most of our competitors on the sweep rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Then on third-party bank deposits, we saw through this earnings season that many banks relying more on
wholesale funding. So I guess the question is, what are you seeing in terms of demand from third-party banks?
And where should we expect the third-party bank fee rate to go if the Fed stabilizes at 4.5% and is there a
possibility that you're able to earn a higher spread on those deposits as you renegotiate your contracts next year
than the typical, I think, Fed funds plus 12.5 basis points or so that you're typically on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think absolutely. The demand's way up and I – as you pointed out, if you look at almost all of our
competitors, if you really look at just what's happened to cash sweeps, we're all in the same ballpark. It's just most
of the other firms have gone into high-yield savings to supplement their cash or the money market sweeps, so –
we haven't done that. So – we may, but today, we feel like we have ample low-cost funding with our sweeps. And
we do see the demand going up, which will impact rates. And, Paul, I'll let you address the rate dynamic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, at the trough in the last year or so, the demand from third-party banks was obviously very weak
and the pricing was kind of in that Fed funds effective range, which was down 20 basis points or so from the peak
spreads a couple of years prior. So we're quickly seeing that demand resume, that's the first step, and now we're
starting to see prices and the economics improve on the spread. But again, 20-basis-point spread improvement, if
that's sort of the potential to get back to the last kind of peak spread two years ago, pales in comparison to the
base rate improvement that we get from the Federal Reserve on those balances. So net-net, a significant tailwind,
though, on those balances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So it sounds like in terms of the fee rate, you could be well above the 2 percentage points or so that you peaked
at during the prior cycle at the – so if we compare the end of this rate hike cycle, should we expect a fee rate
above the 2 percentage points that you saw last cycle?

Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Perhaps just a little bit of context or color on the advisor recruiting market. I know it's obviously
been another kind of challenging quarter from a volatility standpoint, so would just love to get a little bit of color as
to what you're seeing industry wide in terms of those dynamics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. I think I've been now, what, 12, dozen years on this job and everybody always ask me if the recruiting
market seems to be getting more competitive. And so my response is it's kind of always been competitive and
we've been on a good roll. So we still see it as very active. We – even in 2009, we thought recruiting in our best
year would go off because of the great dislocation but it was – actually resulted in our best couple of years until
the recent few years. So it's still very active, it's very competitive and continues to be such. But as you can see
with our kind of 400 advisors added this year, if you adjust for the RIA channel, the people that moved [ph] to our
advisor account (00:41:39), we've had another very, very strong year, and really the largest teams we've ever
recruited continue to come in. And so the average is going up also, not just market but just the attraction of our
platform for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth advisors, as well as the advisors that we've recruited
throughout our history.
So we're still – still a big part of our strategy. We think it'll still be strong. Backlog is strong and it probably won't
last forever, but it looks pretty good in the short to midterm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerald Edward O'Hara Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Fair enough. And then perhaps one for Paul Shoukry. Can you maybe just comment a little bit, we obviously saw
an increase from 2Q to 3Q on the non-comp side of expenses that actually came off a little bit in 4Q, but can you
perhaps maybe help us think a little bit about how that kind of run rate might look going into the next couple of
quarters.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Jerry, most of the sequential increase was really attributable to having a full quarter results for both TriState
Capital and SumRidge which sequentially added about $25 million of non-compensation expenses. So that was
the primary driver of the sequential increase which we expected. Looking forward, I think if you look at this quarter
as a baseline and I think there's around $410 million of non-compensation expenses when you adjust out for the
loan loss provision and for some of the acquisition-related expenses that we break out in our non-GAAP
schedule.
And looking forward, I would say, that would be – potentially our best guess right now for fiscal 2023 is that
number totaling around $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023, which off the $410 million base represents somewhere around
1.5% growth sequentially each quarter in 2023. And most of that growth will really be coming from our technology
investments. We're still heavily investing in technology to support advisors, their clients and really all of the
businesses and functions across the firm. So that's going to continue to be a significant focus for us going
forward. And then you're going to see kind of on a year-over-year basis growth in business development
expenses as the first half of fiscal 2022, travel and conferences obviously were still suppressed by the COVID
pandemic. So you'll see that normalized for the full year in fiscal 2023.

Sachs. Go right ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe, first, just focusing on some of the bank dynamics. I
guess if we look at the last cycle, bank NIM peaked at around 3.5%. And not to pinpoint you to any specific
quarter, but I guess when you zoom out a little bit and taking your conservative posture on the deposit betas, but
it doesn't sound like they're going up above 50%. If you think about TriState now in the mix, that's more loan
heavy, so obviously higher yielding and the absolute level of rates is higher. So should we be thinking closer to
4% bank NIM once the Fed is done? Or how are you thinking about that sort of run rate on the other end of that
cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Alex, there's a lot of moving parts. I would say, one of the differences now versus in the last cycle is that our
concentration of securities-based loans are higher. Now that has a – typically has a lower NIM associated with it
because they're fully collateralized with liquid marketable securities. So the risk-adjusted returns are very
attractive but typically lower NIM through cycles relative to corporate loans. And so, there's a lot of moving parts
there. I think, just like I shared with Manan on the BDP fees, I think this time around, I mean, rates are expected
to be higher than they were last cycle, just the base rates. And so given the loan mix, higher rates, a lot of
different variables, but I don't think we can call 3.5% necessarily a ceiling. But I don't think we're also ready to say
that it could achieve 4% either. I think we need to kind of see where cash sorting and cost of deposit trends play
out.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Fair enough. Just staying on the balance sheet theme for one more minute, you guys obviously
had the right call on not extending duration a year or two ago and keeping the balance sheet fairly floating. But if
you look at what's going on today, security yields are quite attractive and maybe there's a little bit more upside,
but that's a fairly good return on invested capital as you kind of look at what the market rates are today. What are
your thoughts about building a securities portfolio from here, maybe extending duration a little bit just to lock in
what looks like pretty attractive rates of return?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we're not against the securities portfolio, but our first thing is to fund our growth and loans and securities
becomes the next part of it. So we agree they're attractive. After being beat up for not locking in rates over a
number of years, we're not after [indiscernible] (00:47:11) out and now having the balance sheet, we're not ready
to call that we've reached peak rates and we're going to start locking in. So I think at least in the near term, we're
going to be flexible as the Fed probably has a couple of rate hikes and then we'll look at it. And if things settle
down, we may balance in a little more. But our first funding is for growth and then any excess funding, we're
certainly happy to put in securities, because you're right, they have a very good spread right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think – I think kind of looking forward, we really built up the securities portfolio in the last couple of years
as the – there's very little third-party bank demand, so we kind of brought it on to the balance sheet as an
accommodation. But now with the cash sorting dynamics, with loan growth being solid, we would expect some of
that buildup in securities to really run off over the next year to fund that loan growth that Paul talked about.
And some of that loan growth has duration as well. I mean – so you saw the mortgage portfolio grew sequentially
during the quarter pretty nicely. There is duration obviously associated with that portfolio that gives us that same
type of protection. But to the extent that we take duration, our preference has been to take it to support client
relationships. And to the extent that we have excess kind of cash beyond the loan growth, then we would certainly
invest in securities because it is a good return, as is the cash we sweep off to third-party banks as well. So right
now, we have a lot of different options and that's just the power of the flexibility that we have with the cash
balances and the flexibility that we preserved, frankly, through the last couple of years.

Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Steve.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So I wanted to start with a question on [indiscernible] (00:49:24). You alluded, Paul, to some of the headwinds to
the business. It's been run rating in the last couple of quarters at about $100 million. This most recent quarter, you
noted included SumRidge Partners contribution as well. As the Fed continues to remove excess liquidity from the
system, do you anticipate further pressure on this $100 million baseline or is that a fair run rate that we can
underwrite looking out to next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
You can see the dynamic. We have a great fixed income franchise, but really in that banking space, that's very,
very strong and they're focused on the same dynamics the whole industry is. So as cash tightens, they're going to
fund loans first and securities second, just like us. So, yeah, that could have pressure. Now there's other parts of
the business that'll certainly have pressure on that run rate if it gets tighter. And again, on the other hand,
SumRidge is – maybe timing is everything, but this is kind of the perfect market for them to perform. They are just
really killing it right now. But they're – everything's in their favor but everything's a headwind for that banking part
of the franchise that we're so good at. So it could come under more pressure also.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Great. And just for my follow-up, maybe on the comp ratio. Certainly, a nice positive surprise, especially relative to
the guidance. I understand, Paul, or can appreciate your reluctance to update the 19% to 20%-plus margin target.
But wanted to get a sense as to how we should think about your philosophy around comp, given so much of the
revenue growth is going to come from less compensable areas, what's a reasonable expectation for where the
comp rate should be running if rates stay higher for longer?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, where we have been even with our advisors and associates, we've paid them what we think is fairly on their
production and we haven't paid on interest. Now interest went away, we didn't change their payouts and comp.
Obviously, it affects management's comp. So our plan right now is to keep – interest rates will continue to be non-
compensable, and so certainly impacts some of the bank comp. But generally, to the extent there's more interest
spread and margin, comp will go down; to the extent that normalizes or goes the other way, the ratio will go up.
There's no change fundamentally in how we're paying based on it. So again, interest spreads will drive it down for
a period of time. I think spreads right now are, like in any cycle, probably outsized for – I don't know if they're out
how long and it stays a year, two years, quarter, but it will return. But we're – our comp philosophy is the same.
So you should see improvement in spreads if interest spreads improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the one thing I would add is the compensation philosophy kind of from outside of the sort of advisor force
that Paul was talking about was to help to share the success of the firm with our associates. And we are in a high
inflation environment, and so whereas we're entering year-end, we are leaning in to being generous to our
associates and sharing in the success with our associates, just as we always do. And so, those year-end
increases won't really be reflected until the second fiscal quarter – the first calendar quarter of the fiscal year, and
that's when payroll taxes reset, of course. But as Paul said, the interest spreads have been a significant benefit to
our compensation ratio down to this kind of 62% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And anything on the admin cost side that we need to be mindful of? I do think the admin comp was running
a little bit higher than we had anticipated, or at least based on what some of the napkin math would suggest when
you try to back out some of the non-compensable portions of revenue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I mean, that reflects the full quarter of results from both TriState Capital and SumRidge. So I think this baseline
going forward is a good baseline to start off with. But again, we will increase salaries across the board and we're
leaning in to being generous with that, given the competitive labor environment, the inflationary pressures and the
success that we're having as a firm. So we really want to share that success with the associates who've made it
all possible.
And that again – and we're also continuing to hire in all of our businesses to support and continue the great
growth that we've had across our businesses, and so that, that would really be reflected throughout fiscal 2023.

Okay. Sorry. So deposits are down to about 6% of client assets based on sort of the guidance for October – client
cash, I should say. Can you remind us of the historical average for cash levels, maybe a low and high range. Just
trying to think through where that starts to bottom out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
It's a pretty wide range. I think the peak of that range was in the mid-teens in 2009. But of course, that was
because cash increase and markets decreased substantially. But I would say the trough was somewhere in that
5% range, maybe a little lower than 5% in 2019. So to your point, we're at 6%. I think the 25-year historical
average is probably in the 7% to 8% range. So it's a pretty wide range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q

balance sheet and...

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if they get [ph] low (00:55:46) – right now, we've been fortunate and have managed it
well. As you know, we've been focused on the flexible balance sheet. But you need cash to operate the business.
So if you see runs, we've talked about even offering high-rate savings and others, we just haven't implemented it,
haven't felt like we need to. But if we see cash getting to levels that concern us, we will do that.
We also have TriState now who is a very good source of funding. They've got a very strong net funding operation,
which was one of the reasons for the acquisition, which I don't think few understood. They said, so much cash,

why would you have it? I think it was a year ago we were talking about our concern about cash in the future, so
it's – so we've got alternatives now, but absolutely you need cash to run this business and you want to be able to
service your client cash. And at some point, we look at our cash balances, they haven't left the system, they've
gone more into fixed income or money markets in our platform. So they're still in the system. We just haven't kept

Devin Ryan Q

Good. Most questions have been asked. Want to come back to the balance sheet a bit here and just think about
your mix and maybe follow-up on Alex's question. Just your deposits obviously becoming more scarce here. And
so when you think about the mix moving forward, are there beyond you may be thinking about securities book?
Are there other areas maybe in the loan book or just more broadly where there's room for optimization and maybe
areas to drive the risk-adjusted NIM higher from here, all else equal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, part of what we're doing as we're going through our budgeting exercise is to say where do we want to deploy
capital? We've got with the banking business a broader bank business. TriState is an independent business with
its third-party platforms. And the question is, between that and Raymond James Bank, where do you allocate
capital in the portfolio really to optimize partly the balance sheet from our standpoint but really to allow freedom,
for example, for TriState to service their customers. So we're going through that to make sure that the capital

allocations make sense both for those businesses and for us. So there always is. In the periods of rapid transition
right now, it's a little bit harder to do it but we're in a lot of discussion on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, just to reinforce that, we really don't manage the balance sheet allocation to necessarily
maximize NIM. We do it to maximize risk-adjusted returns. And we believe that securities-based loans both at
Raymond James Bank to our own clients at TriState Capital to their independent clients is the best risk-adjusted
return. So that is kind of the priority to the extent that demand is there, which we think that over time, that should
continue to be a good tailwind for us. And then we look at the other loan categories. We like the mix that we have
right now with 35% of our loans and securities-based loans. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yes. Okay. Thanks, Paul. And then a follow-up here, just want to talk a little bit about the investment banking
outlook. Appreciate there's always a little bit of crystal ball in there and you guys are going to, I think, err on the
side of conservatism, just given the uncertainty in the market. But just want to make sure I understand how you're
thinking about it. You have – equity issuances is going to be market centric, but market stabilized, that probably
would improve. And then your M&A business is structurally larger. So all else equal, that the business trajectory
over time is higher than fixed income. It feels like maybe could remain a bit under pressure if rates remain higher.
So just trying to think about how much of – maybe that this more muted near-term outlook is just purely market
centric versus maybe – that the flip side would be maybe every business doesn't snap back to where it was over
the last year or two because rates are higher or there's some other – structural dynamic in the markets has
changed. So I just want to kind of parse through both the cyclical versus anything that may be a little bit more
impaired for a continued period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think if you look at, I'll go in reverse order, the fixed income business, I mean, the challenge for a traditional fixed
income business in a rising rate market is when do people invest kind of in the long term. And that will happen as
rates come up. I think that that business will do well. So people have been buying shorter term. As they start
buying longer term, it's more profitable for us, too. But you got to get rates to a point where people think rates are
there to really start doing that. And certainly, the increase in rates will help but we're just at a pause really till that
happens. So I think that's more timing.
M&As are a little harder. Backlog is good, clients are good. Even now – right now, it's up for us and it's up in
Europe for the industry. And if you look at European dynamics with rates and inflation, everything, you go, well,
how could that be? So, I mean, there's still cash. There's still strategic investors. And our growth and our platform
and who we've added and we're continuing to grow it, we believe in it, but that one's harder to predict. I mean, it's
been stronger I think than most people have predicted with the backlog still strong but when people close or not or
when that stops, it's just – that's a tough one. So when you come off of the last two years with almost
unprecedented M&A, is that a baseline or is that a peak forever, which it probably isn't. But again, we're still very,
very high on that business. But that one's kind of hard to say what triggers it to continue or what triggers it to slow
down or stop for a while.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Okay. All right. Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll proceed to our next question on the line with Kyle Voigt from KBW. Go right ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. So just given the level of sorting right now and the pressure that may put on total available
funding as you look out a couple of years, just completely understand the cautiousness and the tone around the
size of the AFS book and maybe letting some of that run off in order to support loan growth. So just two follow-ups
on that. What is the current duration of AFS portfolio and how much of that portfolio would run off per year if you
didn't reinvest at all in the portfolio? And can you also remind us, are there specific minimums that you need to
hold in terms of the CIP and a third-party bank sweep? Just so we have that as the sorting process continues
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I would say in the securities portfolio, the average duration is somewhere around four years now in the securities
portfolio. So if you think about kind of a normal distribution, you might have somewhere around 20% to 25% runoff
a year, probably back end loaded a little bit but – and again, we're going to use a lot of that to fund the loan
growth as the current plans. There is a baseline for CIP of cash balances there. If you kind of look back in 2019, I
think there's probably $2.5 billion or $3 billion of cash there for a variety of reasons. And so maybe that's kind of a
good way to think about the floor there for those balances. And really, with BDP, that's a function of providing
clients FDIC insurance, trying to maximize their FDIC coverage as much as we possibly can, given all the
constraints and the demand from third-party banks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And so, is there – is there, I guess, given your clients' allocation and then you only have certain number of
charters that you can provide FDIC insurance with yourself, so is there a certain amount of minimum there, I
guess, on the third-party bank side? Is it a few billion dollars that needs to be held there or is it some number
that's smaller than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
No, really, the way we think about the minimum on the BDP balances is essentially providing some level of
funding buffer. We don't want to overextend the funding as we've seen in the industry. It's challenging when you
overextend the funding to your own banks and you don't have a buffer there. And that's one of the things that
we're thinking through is what do we want that buffer to be. Now our balance sheet is much more liquid than it
used to be 10 years ago when we established the 50% buffer that some of you are aware of. So we think that's
much too conservative, but we're kind of currently – now that we've completed the acquisition of TriState Capital,
understanding their balance sheet, we're currently in the midst of determining what the appropriate buffer is, but
we're going to, just as we always do, err on the side of conservatism there as well.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
Understood. That's really helpful. And I just had one follow-up related to administrative comp. I think on last
quarter's call you mentioned there was an off-cycle bonus paid in the fiscal third quarter which caused the PCG
segment admin comp to be elevated But we saw another [ph] $50 million (01:05:46) sequential increase in that
PCG admin comp line in the fiscal fourth quarter. So just wondering what drove that and how much of that is
onetime in nature, if at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I'm not sure. I think it was a 5% sequential increase. And again, that bounces around based on benefit
accruals that we adjust for, particularly at the end of the fiscal year, making sure we're fully funded and accrued
for on benefits and other things. So there's nothing that I could point to specifically that would describe that other
than just sort of natural growth and like changes to the accruals, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Understood. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much. We'll proceed with our final question for today from the line of Bill Katz of Credit
Suisse. Go right ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. This is [ph] Michael Kelly (01:06:48) on for Bill. Thank you for taking my question. Most questions
have been asked but I did have one follow-up on the loan mix, Paul and Paul. Are you seeing any shift in demand
for the SBL? Looks like on the end of period basis, they dipped a little bit. The revenue was pretty resilient. But
are you seeing any shift in demand with the higher interest rate environment that we should be worried about near
term? I understand your long-term outlook is quite positive for the balance sheet in general.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that – yes. Some of that SBL dip was really – a lot of people use that as GAAP funding. So part of the
mortgage demand where people went from SBL to pay those off and I'd say mortgaged homes and other things.
So we think the demand is there. And not only is it there for our clients, I think TriState is growing their market
share with new relationships, too, as a huge opportunity. So I think SBLs over time are still – even short term and
longer term, still very, very positive. The question becomes, as the rates continue to go up, when was that really
cheap source of funding? Maybe not, people are less likely to borrow, but I still think that business is doing well.
So I think you see a blip – saw a blip this quarter really on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. Thanks. And then if I'd just add one more follow-up. As a percentage of AUA, you still are – the SBLs as a
percentage of AUA behind some of your wirehouse peers, do you see that gap closing over time?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2022
We've just never been as aggressive in pushing debt through our organization. I mean that – so our products,
SBL is even a relatively new product for us compared to our competitors, so – and we certainly don't have quotas
for anyone to present it or require them to present or even branch managers with quotas. So because of that, our
debt concentration historically has been lower than certainly our wirehouse competitors. And we continue to gain
share, but we do it more through natural means and the advisor really has to initiate that versus us going out and
pushing it or selling it to advisors. So – but our – it's going up but we're just not aggressive in that, haven't been,
it's just part of the culture for a long time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. Thank you. Makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much. And, Mr. Reilly, that was the final question. I'll turn it back to you for any closing
remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, great. Appreciate everybody being on the call. And although a very strong end of the year, it's the
environment outside of the equity markets and interest rates and cash sorting and everything else so it's hard to
call. We're still – that's when we really appreciate the flexibility we have in the balance sheet, our capital base and
everything else to be able to navigate. So optimistic about the future. Don't know what's going to happen, as you
get GDP and you get people still raising rates and inflation, it's going to be an interesting quarter – a couple of
quarters. But that's when you can see that our advisors are still 90s – clients stay 97% satisfied with our advisors
is pretty high rate and they need them more now than ever.
So with that, appreciate your time and we'll talk to you soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much and thank you, everyone. That does conclude the call for today. We thank you
for your participation and please disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone.
