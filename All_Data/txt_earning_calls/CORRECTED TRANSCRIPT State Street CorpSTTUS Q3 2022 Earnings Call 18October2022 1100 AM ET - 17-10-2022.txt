Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene; and good morning, everyone. 2022 continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory,
with the challenges faced today arising partly out of, but acutely different from, those the world faced in 2020
during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the global operating environment continues to be very
challenging, our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on
maintaining and further improving State Street's pre-tax margin, which was a solid 29% in the third quarter,
excluding notable items.
During the third quarter, financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in
Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including continued price and wage inflation, dramatically higher
interest rates, significant US dollar strength and heightened fears of a global recession. These factors collectively
drove heightened uncertainty, which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income
markets, as well as increased market volatility, which in turn, impacted flows.

We continue to carefully navigate the business through this environment. While the operating climate created a
number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in third quarter, the savings and efficiency of our Alpha and
enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset
owners in the current market and inflationary environment. We maintained a solid balance sheet and strong
capital position, delivered significant NII growth, as well as healthy FX trading revenues and remain laser-focused
on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management.
Turning to slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the
quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance, third quarter 2022 EPS was $1.80 or $1.82,
excluding notable items; compared to $1.96 or $2, excluding notable items in 3Q 2021. Double-digit year-over-
year declines and average global equity market values drove most of this decrease.
Total fee revenue for the third quarter declined 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly
lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees, as well as the stronger US
dollar. Within total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise once again continued to perform well, with FX
trading services and securities finance revenues increasing 14% and 4% year-over-year, respectively, as the
business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients.
We also drove a solid result within front-office software and data, with third quarter revenue increasing 9% year-
over-year. Total revenue for the third quarter declined just 1% year-over-year, as lower total fee revenue was
largely offset by a very strong NII result, which increased 36% relative to the year-ago period, driven primarily by
higher interest rates.
Faced with continued market-related fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, we remain focused on
controlling expense growth. Even as we invested in our people and business, third quarter total expenses were
flat, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the stronger US dollar and
expense management.
Business momentum was solid in the third quarter, with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to $233
billion. Encouragingly, our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing Alpha clients,
demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new back-office mandates through
our Alpha strategy. As a result of this quarter's solid sales performance, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed with
$3.4 trillion at quarter end. Front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter,
with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $267 million.
At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.3 trillion. Overall, third quarter AUM flows and
management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets, but we still saw positive
net flows into our cash, SPY and US low-cost ETF products during the quarter. Even in the volatile environment,
our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year with AUM reaching a
record level in third quarter, having experienced four quarters in a row of inflows.
We remain excited by our Global Advisors strategy and the growth potential of the franchise and announced new
leadership in the third quarter, as Yie-Hsin Hung will become SSGA's new President and CEO in December.
I would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investor Services business,
which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The current regulatory environment
for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with US and
international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including changes to the operating
model and legal entity structure, and a reduction to the purchase price. We anticipate that a modified transaction
would be somewhat more complex and included delay in timing and amount of deal synergies, resulting in a
slower path to accretion.
While discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful
outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will
be agreed and enter into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions
for a modified transaction.
The modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both BBH's partners and our board
of directors. As previously noted, the sale and purchase agreement allows each of State Street and BBH the right
to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time.
We continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling, and that has encouraged us
to continue to seek an acceptable path forward. These efforts are actively underway. And as we previously stated,
we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio was a
strong 13.2% at quarter end. As I have noted previously, we recognize the importance of capital return to our
shareholders and it remains an integral component of our medium-term targets. Accordingly, having already
announced a 10% per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year, we now intend to
repurchase approximately $1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing
common stock repurchase program authorization which expires at the end of 2022.
Additionally, in keeping with our medium-term targets, it is also our intention to return greater than 80% of
earnings in 2023 in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to approval by our board
of directors and market conditions at the time. If the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services does not
progress, we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount.
To conclude, the events of the last 2.5 years have demonstrated the resiliencies of State Street's business model
during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Even as financial markets broadly
declined in the third quarter, we delivered a healthy pre-tax margin of 29%, excluding notable items, in addition to
solid new business wins.
While the environment is challenging and uncertain, we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully
execute against our strategic agenda and improve our operating model and financial performance over the
medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
As we look ahead, we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused
on managing what we can control, as our solid expense discipline in 2022 to-date has demonstrated, with year-to-
date total expenses flat to the same nine-month period in 2021, even as we invested meaningfully in our people
and business.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Eric W. Aboaf
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on slide 4. We
reported EPS of $1.80, or $1.82 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, as detailed in the panel on the right
of the slide.
As you know, the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging, with persistent market volatility
related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates, and concerns about
the global economy.
Despite these challenges, as you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income
and our FX trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity
and fixed income markets in the quarter.
Additionally, we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter, even as we
experienced ongoing price and wage increases, while we continue to invest in the franchise.
Turning to slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end Investment Services AUC/A decrease by 18% on a
year-on-year basis and 7% sequentially. The year-on-year change was largely driven by continued lower period-
end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition, and
the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. The quarter-on-quarter
decline was largely a result of these same factors.
Similarly, at Global Advisors, period-end AUM decreased 15% year-on-year and 6% sequentially. The year-on-
year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period-end market levels, institutional net outflows and the
impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our ETF and cash
businesses.
Turning to slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter total servicing fees down 12% year-on-year,
largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, lower client activity and adjustments,
normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding
the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year.
Even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter, I would highlight that we're pleased to
see good double-digit growth in our private markets businesses. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 6%,
primarily as a result of these same drivers.
Lastly, we recorded traditional custody wins worth $233 billion in the quarter, with attractive fee rates across key
client segments. And we now have more than $3.2 trillion of assets to be installed, a good portion of which are
attributed to large Alpha deals that were won over the past year. Given our large backlog, we installed
approximately $350 billion of assets this quarter, which is in line with our historical pace.
Turning to slide 7. Third quarter management fees were $472 million, down 10% year-on-year, primarily reflecting
lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously disclosed client-specific pricing adjustment,
institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of
money market fee waivers and positive net ETF and cash inflows. Management fees were down 4% quarter-on-
quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation.

Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter, while we did see some outflows in our ETF business due
to an exit of a low-yielding Asia-Pacific fund, our franchise still remains well-positioned for growth. In ETFs, we
saw sustained ETF inflows into the SPDR Low-Cost suite and Fixed Income funds.
In our institutional business, there's continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of $10
billion, including the Target Date franchise. In our cash business, top-quartile performance on our Government
Money Market Fund was a major driver of net inflows, which contributed to market share gains in the Institutional
Money Market Funds.
On slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, third quarter FX
trading services revenue was up 14%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads, driven by higher market volatility
and the recent regulatory capital changes, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, FX
trading services revenue was down 4% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client
FX volumes, which tend to be lower in the summer months.
Securities finance performed well in the third quarter, with revenues up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by
higher spreads due to higher specialty activity, only partially offset by lower Agency and Enhanced Custody
balances due to falling market levels. Sequentially, revenues were up 3%, mainly reflecting higher Agency
spreads.
Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher front-office
software revenues associated with CRD, which were up 9%, while lending fees were down 11% due to changes
in product mix. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $5 million in the third quarter declined on a year-on-year
basis, largely due to negative market-related adjustments. Sequentially, we saw an increase in other fee revenue,
primarily reflecting fewer negative market-related adjustments.
Moving to slide 9, let me provide some details on the performance of the front-office software and data revenue in
the third quarter on the left panel of the slide. Front-office software revenues increased 9% year-on-year, as our
more durable and recurring software-enabled revenue continues to grow nicely, driven by new client
implementations and continued success in converting clients through our cloud-based SaaS platform
environment. Sequentially, revenues were up 1% due to higher software-enabled revenue, partially offset by
lower professional services revenue. Our revenue backlog remains healthy.
Turning to some of the CRD and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we continue to be pleased with our
new bookings for the business. The $14 million of new bookings from this quarter was well-diversified across
client segments, particularly wealth and asset owners, demonstrating the benefit of and breadth of clients the
platform can now support. As for middle office, we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue
backlog of over $100 million, which is up 50% on a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned earlier.
Now turning to slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 36% year-on-year and 13% sequentially, primarily reflecting
the impact of higher short-term interest rates from central bank hikes, only partially offset by lower client deposits.
More than 40% of this increase was driven by non-US dollar rates, as we saw central banks globally raise interest
rates.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. As a result of a rapidly
changing rate environment, industry-wide deposits have begun to trend lower, and we are seeing some of this
play through our balance sheet as well. Excluding the impact of currency translation, average deposits were down
7

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
5%, both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central
banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on AUC/A.
The investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration, and we now have more than 60%
in HTM. As to today's results reaffirm, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest
rate and NII tailwind and also protect AOCI.
Turning to slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in
light of the revenue environment and flat year-on-year; were up approximately 4% adjusted for currency
translation and notable items. We've been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization
savings efforts, which generated approximately $80 million in year-on-year gross savings or approximately $230
million year-to-date, which puts us in line to achieve our full-year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4% of
the expense base.
It also contributed to our year-to-date positive operating leverage, which we also expect to deliver for the full year.
These savings, in addition to benefits from a stronger US dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we
have been seeing in the industry, while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company, including
Alpha, private markets and operations automation.
On a line-by-line basis compared to third quarter 2021, compensation/employee benefits were down 1%, as the
impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher
head count. Headcount increased 6%, primarily in our Poland and India global centers as we invested in
important technology capabilities and added operations talent to support new products and services in growth
areas such as Alpha, private markets and in middle-office servicing. There's also a portion of the head count
increase associated with some hiring catch-up post COVID. We expect head count growth to start to level off.
Information systems and communications expenses were down 2%, as we began to see benefits from our
insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure
investments. Transaction processing was down 10%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs related to equity
market movements. Occupancy was down 5%, largely due to currency translation. And other expenses were up
17%, primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs, marketing costs, travel costs and foundation grants.
Moving to slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased to report CET1
of 13.2%, up 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher retained earnings and well-controlled
RWA. With respect to RWAs, there is volatility, and I would caveat that they were lower than we expected this
quarter. We would anticipate some RWA increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and
efficiently put capital to work across our businesses. Third quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4% was up 40 basis
points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings.
As the slide highlights, our capital position is strong and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital
remains steadfast. In keeping with that commitment, we returned $232 million to shareholders in the third quarter
through dividends. And as Ron highlighted, we now intend to repurchase approximately $1 billion of State Street's
common stock in the fourth quarter. This higher-than-expected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital
levels and our expected future uses of capital. The AFS mark to market and OCI this quarter amounted to $170
million negative, as compared to minus $0.5 billion in 2Q 2022, meaningfully improved as a result of the
management actions we took, despite another strong run-up in interest rates this quarter.

Turning to slide 13, we provide a summary of our third quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market
environment, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance. Even with the current macroeconomic environment and
persistent geopolitical uncertainties, our strong growth in net interest income and FX trading services enabled us
to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets, highlighting
the resiliency of the franchise. And our expenses remained well-controlled, demonstrating our laser focus on
productivity.
Turning to our outlook. Let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro
assumptions, as we look over the remainder of the year. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have
been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests the year-
end fed funds rate of 4.5%. We expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in 4Q and
beyond into 2023 as well.
Our outlook assumes 4Q equity market levels will be flat to September month-end, which would imply a 10%
quarter-on-quarter decline in global daily average equity markets in 4Q. We also expect continued US dollar
strength to be worth about 1 percentage point of headwind to fee and a tailwind to expenses on a quarter-on-
quarter basis, which is included in our guide. So, in terms of the fourth quarter of 2022. Given the expected
decline in average global equity market levels, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 3% on a sequential
quarter basis, with servicing fees down 4% to 5% quarter-on-quarter and management fees down 8% quarter-on-
quarter.
Turning to NII. Following yet another strong sequential increase in NII in 3Q, we expect to deliver additional NII
growth of 4% to 10% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from US and foreign central bank rate hikes. This
outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in 4Q. For the full year, we now expect NII to
increase 28% to 30%, which is better than our prior full-year guide of 24% to 27%. We also expect continued
good growth in NII in full-year 2023.
Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite inflationary
wage pressure as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee
revenue. This focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pre-tax margin for
both the fourth quarter and the full year. Full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year. Finally, we
would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% for the quarter.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi there. So, maybe just a wrap-up question on BBH, and I appreciate all the transparency along the way. But
regulators hate it, more complex, market values have fallen, I definitely am with you on the strategic merits. But I
guess, the question people have is, why not just walk away? It seems like you could do some really accretive stuff
with the capital now. And at what point do you just say, not worth it, not as accretive to complex, enough said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Glenn, it's Ron. Maybe needless to say, we go through that calculus that you're describing every day. And that's
part of what's led to this. I mean, obviously, the regulatory environment is driving the timeframe here. But what's
driving our work is that trade-off, the trade-off between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis, a very
attractive firm versus what's the alternative uses of the capital, including returning it back to shareholders.
We believe there's still the possibility that we can get this – we can structure this transaction in a way that it will
work both for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective. But as we've said in the disclosure, the
likelihood of that happening is going down. So, I think, what you can take away from this is one of the reasons
that's driving that decrease probability is the calculus that you're describing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Well, I guess, we don't have to wait that much longer, so I can still help for another couple of months. Just
one follow-up on – I think, you mentioned 60% of securities portfolio has been moved into held to maturity. It
shows in the smaller AOCI hits as rates go up. What's the other side of it? Like do you – can you calculate what
the NII give-up or any other offsets to moving that large of a piece in held to maturity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Glenn, it's Eric. We've carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio move to held to maturity and in
what amount. But what we do, as we make that consideration is, the benefit is that you largely don't give up NII,
right. By and large, you're earning the coupon and whether there are treasuries, or agencies, or MBS, just in a
different accounting form and structure, but the earnings of the corporation are the same and that's what's quite
attractive about HTM.
The reason why you wouldn't put the whole portfolio in HTM is, partly, you want some flexibility. You want to from
time-to-time, rebalance the portfolio. And you might want to rebalance 5, 10, 15 yards, and that takes an AFS
construct under which to do it. And then, partly, you want to make sure that you always have monetization at the
front-end to maximize and to maintain the liquidity construct that you'd like.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
We've now put that in place. We can repo HTM securities in size. We test that in the marketplace, so we're quite
comfortable. But there's a point where you say, look, I'd rather sit on cash, or I'd rather sit on available for sale.
And so, we feel like we're at a good balance now that really provides a real positive NII trajectory. And you see
that. We've guided now to 28% to 30% up in NII this year. And I've also started to signal that we're positive on the
NII trajectory in 2023 and partly because of the entire investment portfolio, whether it's an AFS or HTM is
contributing to that, to the upswing.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to putting the deal into context with the buyback that you
announced, which you have been clearly saying, you'd want to get back into the buyback this quarter. So, could
you just help us understand the $1 billion sizing, and if that has anything to put in context with your thoughts
around how the pricing and eventual outcome, if the deal goes through, might end up coming through; or is it
completely separate and just based on where capital sits regardless of the deal outcome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Ken, it's Eric. As I've said, in my prepared remarks, the buyback was larger than anticipated, and part of that is we
do two things. We look at our current capital levels, which have trended towards that 13% CET1 mark that we had
guided to. Remember that discussion we had in the fourth quarter.
And then, partly because, partly, as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters, including the
possibility of the Brown Brothers Investment Services transaction. And you would expect us to factor in any
adjustments – downward adjustments to purchase price that we would expect, and that's effectively what we've
done. So, it's a mix of factors, but those are the components. And I think we're quite pleased.
We can now proceed with $1 billion. As Ron said, we were planning on comfortably returning more than 80% of
earnings to shareholders next year, quarter by quarter by quarter, which is what our medium-term targets are.
And that still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an, admittedly, adjusted price if it's appropriate at the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then, on the denominator side, I guess, of capital, can you just give us a little color on how you'd
expect deposits to traject from here? Pretty meaningful decline in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing.
Just relative to where you're ending here, just your general outlook on your thoughts around deposit mix and
flows? Thanks.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what you're seeing in the industry. I think
we're within that zone of if you look at the Fed reports, if you look at other institutions. And we've certainly begun
to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter, down about 5%, both year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter
adjusted for currency translation.
I think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it. And this is my way to say
that I can give you some guidance, but it's going to vary depending on how the factors play out. So, you have US
dollar appreciation, and so you have a – non-dollar deposits are come down as a result.
We have equity markets falling, which means the AUC/As that we custody for are coming down. And with that,
investors, institutions, retail hold similarly lower cash amounts. And so, part of what's happening here is the
environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are with rising rates and
quantitative tightening. Now, we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well. So I kind
of give you that as a background because I think there are four or five factors at play here, which is more than
expected.
I think, as we look forward, we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. We expect those to
be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter, but we do expect some, and those are factored into our NII
guide. And one of the reasons why we have a wider NII guide than usual is because there's a range of outcomes.
But we're seeing what we expected. We're seeing what we expected as rate drops and we price carefully and
maintain, I think, some healthy betas. This quarter, we're seeing noninterest-bearing begin to flow out because
with the higher rates both in the US and internationally – the US in particular, you have the difference that clients
can earn.
And then, one of the things we're doing with our clients is to think about the full range of offerings for them.
Sometimes it's the base account; sometimes it's special accounts with deposits. If you remember, we've
historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet.
And then, the other thing that this is feeding is some of our other businesses, whether it's the cash business in
GA, whether it's the repo business. There's a whole set of product offerings that cash flows to that we're pleased
to support our clients with.
So there's quite a bit going on in this area. More to come. But we're comfortable with some of these forecasts.
And what I find particularly important to keep in mind is NII continues to rise, even with some of these deposit
outflows. And part of that is the US rates that we're also familiar with. But given that so much of our balance sheet
is international, those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful and those deposits are at good levels as well.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Ron and Eric. Good morning, guys. I was hoping we could speak a little bit more broadly around State
Street's capital allocation strategy. If BBH does not go through, what's your appetite for any other deals, whether
it's in the services space or asset management space? Obviously, macro conditions are pretty volatile, so I'm sure
that will impact that as well. But curious how you're thinking about the trade-off between accelerating buyback or
other deals?
And then, if you do go down the path of more buybacks, should we be thinking about the upper end of your CET1
and leverage as sort of the target to which you will go to? Or you might need to run with a buffer sort of on top of
that, given uncertain macro conditions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Alex, why don't I begin on this, just on how we think about M&A? It's not like we have a shopping list here.
BBH is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis. And by that I mean, it's not just about
adding to some particular geography, but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that we're in.
Having said that, we've got our own, what we believe, is a distinctive organic strategy in the servicing area, led by
our Alpha proposition, which continues to grow. There is a lot of development that was being completed this year
and early next year, which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and, we think, even make the proposition
attractive to a broader set of clients.
So we always are looking in the marketplace to see if there's something that makes sense, but it's not like the
money is burning a hole in our pocket. And if this doesn't work, we're immediately going to go out and come back
with something else.
Eric, you may want to talk just about how we think about in context of buybacks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. And Alex, I think I'd add that we're quite conscious that we raised almost $2 billion of equity from our
investors and diluted them. We certainly expect that if the deal doesn't proceed, that the bulk of our excess capital
needs to go back to shareholders. That's deserved and I think expected, and we would deliver on that.
I think in terms of capital ratios, I had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and
when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the OCI risk in the investment portfolio, that we might be willing to
go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our 10% to 11% range.
I think, now, given the economic uncertainties, we, for the time being, expect to operate towards the middle of that
range. That might change over time. But for now, I think our current expectation is we have reduced the volatility
in the investment portfolio, which reduces, on one hand, the need for a capital buffer, to some extent. On the
other hand, the economic environment has much more volatility in it, and that pushes us in the other direction. But
the net of that is that, I think, we're quite comfortable with the 10% to 11% range and operating somewhere in the
middle there.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. That's helpful. My follow-up question may be around the business side of things. You guys
have a very sizable pipeline of installations on the servicing side. A lot of them are Alpha mandates, which
obviously tend to be a little bit more complex. You talked to us, I think, on the last call sort of the cadence of how
that's going to come through on the revenue side. But I'm just kind of curious how you would contextualize any
incremental investments or expenses that will need to come with it, given sort of complexity of those installations
over the next 12 to 18 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I'll start, Alex, on the investments. And Eric can talk through the pattern. On the investments, there is
actually ongoing development, as I mentioned earlier. And that development, much of – some of which is being
completed this year, some of which is being completed next year, but it's all part of our medium term plan as well
as our budget. So there is nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this. And in fact, much of the
development is behind us or will be behind us at year-end.
Within the $3.4 trillion, as you would expect, it's the larger, more complex Alpha mandates. In some cases, they're
development partners with us, where we're developing new features and functionality, which will be available, not
just to that particular client, but, more broadly, to the client base. So these are important things to get done,
important things to get done right, and we think are a good use of our investment dollars because they'll result,
not just in being able to onboard that client, but to be able to broaden the offering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
And then, Alex, I'd add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams. Those are well
underway. And so, you saw a head count tick up this quarter, for example. Expenses, though, were well-
controlled. The head count was in our hubs and some of the lower-cost markets purposely, so we're navigating
through that.
But some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of – as we're doing the onboarding, in advance of the
installation and the recognition of revenue, and some come as the revenue comes on. But I think, as Ron said, all
this is within our expense guidance. It'll be within our expense guidance when we get to that in January for next
year.
And our view is that, we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction, given our medium
term targets. That needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift we're getting from Alpha deals, as well as the
expense and productivity initiatives, both within the Alpha environment and across the traditional franchise. And
all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, Ron, Eric. Thanks for taking the questions. I'd like to ask on BBH. It seems somewhat unusual to
be getting regulatory approval before the approvals within the company. So why is that happening? And given
that there is risk of deterioration, loss of talent, customers – Ron, you made reference to this during the last
quarter call when you guys first said you were renegotiating – would you have the ability to adjust price further if
this process drags or has that been set already?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
On the approvals, our board has been actively involved in this, Brennan, as has the BBH partners on their side
throughout this process. So, obviously, there was an approval before we announced this. And in September of
2021, there's an ongoing consultation with our board, and we've walked them through modifications.
But we don't have a final deal yet, largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and
figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators. So, it's not completely binary,
and that we're not talking to our board until it's all done. But obviously, our board needs to see the entire thing in
total and be able to make that decision.
In terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people, that's there. It continues. We're spending a lot of time
with clients. As I think I've mentioned before, about half the client base is a shared client base. So, these are
clients that we talk to anyway. I think there's still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be
completed in a way that makes sense, they'd like to see it completed.
So, I do not worry about further client attrition. We obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides, but
largely on the BBH side, and we're monitoring that closely. And to the extent to which we felt like after the price
reduction we've already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further, that we needed that
again, of course, we would raise up if we needed to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that, Ron. And then, second question is maybe a bit – well, I would just come right out. So, why
is this so strategically compelling? I mean, it seemed as though it was largely a scale deal. Now, it's deteriorated.
You said earlier, Ron, that the accretion is probably going to be more drawn out and it's going to be lower than
initially planned. It's more complicated. So, you're introducing a lot of operational and legal complexity.
I get it, you're lowering the price. But is this really a good use of time? Is this really a good use of management
focus? Why not just understand that the environment deteriorated, the regulatory approvals didn't come through, it
couldn't work as constructed, and so it's better off just to walk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
I mean, again, I'm probably repeating myself a little bit, Brennan, here, but that's exactly what we ask ourselves
every day. And you're right it is taking a lot of management time. I think what's compelling about it is several
things. One is its footprint. Many of the things that are out there, or supposedly out there, rumored to be out there
tend to be single geography kinds of things. And if you have a strong desire to be in that geography, maybe it is
15

something useful, but there, I would describe, as a best, tactical. This one is add scale to us everywhere where
we are. And it really does set it apart from the others.
Secondly, it's got some technology assets that we like. We've talked about those in the past. Third, it's got a set of
people and professionals that we believe are equal to, and sometimes, even better than some of our people, and
that's attractive to us. But that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here, and
we continue to do that, which is why we're not coming here saying to you, yes, this is – we're ready to go. We're
not ready to go. It's also why we're coming here, saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough,
and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, I wanted to ask one clarifying question on NII. Some of your bank peers, they've indicated
4Q exit rate could be close to the peak this cycle, just as lag deposit pricing begins to catch up with rate hikes.
You noted that the 2023 NII, Eric, will be up nicely year-on-year, but do you see the potential for 2023 NII coming
in above that annualized 4Q level, suggesting that, that fourth quarter NII's guidance is not going to be
representative of the peak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
I think you're trying to get deeply into our 2023 forecast, and I think it's a little premature to do that. I mean, to be
honest, let's see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter. Let's see whether the US central bank and the
foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because that's important, right; or are
they going to – or not. So, it's quite dependent upon all that.
I think the reason I made my positive statements about 2023 is that we don't see fourth quarter as the quarterly
peak. We think there's more that – more NII upside over subsequent quarters. We also have a balance sheet that
has a mix of USD and non-USD. And in some cases, we tend to have more foreign deposits. And those are areas
– if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments and their
geographies that give us an additional tailwind, then maybe different than a US bank.
So, there's certainly momentum here. I don't want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of
2023. But I did say, good, continuing growth, purposely. I think there's more to come on NII. But I think we'll know
more in a quarter or two, to be honest, but we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive, given what
we know in the environment today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for that, Eric. So, reading the tea leaves, I may scrap my question on the expense growth algorithm and
what that implies for next year. But the one area I did want to unpack on expense is, the margins in the
16


State Street Corp.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Investment Management segment, they're down about 600 basis points year-on-year. That's an area where you
made significant progress over the last couple of years.
Certainly, you're going to see some pressures given the declining market, but wanted to get a sense as to how
much expense flexibility you have there? And where you think you can actually hold the line on the pre-tax margin
for that particular business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
I think, I'd start answering that question by saying, we're actually quite pleased by the progress we've made in
growth and margins in the Investment Management business over, call it, the last three years. I think it had teens
level margins, if you go back in time, that we got into the 20s. Some of that was the market uptick, which flowed
through the management fee line. Some of it was a – I think, delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues
was positive across the franchise. Cash as an example, continues to be a standout, but each of the three
franchises have new products, and offerings have been quite good.
And I think what the team's done there well is, as they have secured those flows, launched those new products.
They've also managed the expense base. And so, just because it was a tailwind from equity markets, or fixed
income markets, or from flows, they've actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that
environment, which, I think, is a testament to how they've navigated the environment. I think what you should
expect is that a couple of things. If equity markets continue to operate at this level, we need to continue to work
on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company.
I think on the flip side of that, if we get some kind of rebound in equity in fixed income markets that plays through
the asset management business financials, I would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and
margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw. But I would say, I think at 31% margins,
we're quite pleased with where we are. And I think there is – depend on where equity markets go, I think the
trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction.

Brian, it's Eric. I think the timing of this deal is quite uncertain, given where we are. We've not been able to

quarters...

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
...is premature. We've done the buyback calculation, though, fully considering the reduced price that would be
part of the Brown Brothers' transaction. And so, whether the timing is quarter X or quarter Y, we're comfortable
proceeding with the $1 billion. We're pleased to get it started in the coming days. And regardless how that plays
out, be able to return, as I said and as Ron said, comfortably more than the 80% that we've committed to
throughout next year, at a minimum.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, and that is great. And then, just one on the deposit betas. Maybe if you can just talk about how you how
you see them right now as they exist in terms of like how you're defining them for both the US versus the non-US?
And then, as we move into next year, maybe sort of an outlook, without giving NII guidance, of course, but just
sort of a range of where you think the terminal betas could be in the US versus the non-US, even if it's a fairly
wide range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, let me describe it this way. And let me cover US and non-US to – because both matter in a positive way for
our books. I think the betas this quarter in the US were in the 55% range. We're pleased to see that. Those are up
from about 35% last quarter, but exactly where you'd expect us to be, where we expected to be, given the uptick
in rates. And next quarter, if we go from 55% this quarter to 65% beta the next quarter, we'd be quite comfortable.
And then, it just continues to inch up. That's just how it plays through.
In euros, we're also in that 50% range, as we've started to cross into positive territory for central banks, and we
expect that to continue. So part of the reason for the NII forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that, we
expect betas in the 50% to 60% range in euros. The market operates a little differently than the US, but that would
be in the range. And then, in pound sterling, betas are lower, they tend to be in the 30% to 35% range there. And
then, you can keep going, Aussie dollars, Canadian dollars and so forth. And we have a balance sheet that is
prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well. And then, you'll just see betas notch up quarter-over-
quarter.
I think at the terminal level, there's always some amount of lagging that you do. That's just how it happens. You
never get to 100% beta or anything near that, because you have some noninterest-bearing and you have some
lagged deposits, but we'll see. We're comfortable where we are in the 50% range going to 60%. And I think it'll
play out well for the NII and the balance sheet accordingly.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Eric, maybe just one last question on NII, and I apologize. But as we think about big picture,
fed funds being potentially 200 basis points or more higher than 2018, European rates being positive versus
negative back then, do you see anything conceptually to suggest your NIM shouldn't be higher than back then, or
– just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Jim, it's Eric. I'm a little more focused on NII than on NIM. And the reason we've done that is, because we've
actually changed the shape of our balance sheet, over time. I mean, remember, we've added some deposit
initiatives, which tend to be at lower NIMs, but they are NII-accretive and positive. And we do that because,
sometimes, we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet. We want to raise deposits where we want
to land. We need to keep deposits for intraday. There are lots of reasons why we have different mix of the
balance sheet. And we've done that purposely in an engaging way with our clients over the last two, three years.
So, I don't think – as a result, the balance sheet is bigger. And part of the reason we've allowed it to be bigger is
that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us, and so what our intentionality is actually to maximize
NII as opposed to NIM. So I think as you play that out, I think our NIMs are lower at this point than they were last
time in the cycle. And I think they'll likely be below – the NIMs will be below the highs of the last cycle.
On the other hand, I think, if you calculate the forecast we've given you for NII for fourth quarter, so the next
quarter that we're about to print, that will be a new high of NII relative to what we had seen in the last cycle. And
that's where we're a little more focused, because that's what comes back to shareholders and what creates
earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line.

Jim Mitchell Q

Okay. Fair enough. And just maybe on the BlackRock ETF transition. How much is left? And do you see that as a
material – any kind of a material impact on forward revenues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Our guidance has been pretty consistent on this. And I think you'll find it in our 10-Qs and Ks that we estimate that
the revenue outflow is about 2 percentage points of fees. So, that hasn't changed. You saw some of that begin to
come out this quarter. That was worth about $5 million this quarter. If you kind of get to the full-quarter amount, it'll
19

be just under $10 million for fourth quarter. And that was worth about $1 trillion of AUCA. So that did occur, and
we'll continue to keep you updated on that.
But as we've previously disclosed and talked about, deconversions just take time. And it'll play out some time
towards the second half of 2023; and then, into 2024 will probably be the majority of it, but we'll just see. We're
working closely with BlackRock. We continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them
and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area, which we're one of the largest providers. And we'll
certainly help them if they want to evolve, diversify and support their plans.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon, Eric and Ron. Eric, can you remind us, you talked a little bit about it in your prepared
remarks about fee revenues, the pricing pressure that you see every year. Can you remind us if that number has
changed a bit at all?
And second, as part of that, I think you've also indicated in the past, you needed a certain amount of assets under
custody to neutralize that pressure. And don't remember, I think it was $1.5 trillion, but I could be wrong, of new
business wins to neutralize that downward pricing pressure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, let me start that, and it is an area that we continue to work on. The pricing headwinds are just a condition
of our industry. Why? Because, as you remember, pricing is AUM or AUC/A-based. And so, as equity markets go
up, clients expect some of that to come back to them. The pricing headwinds, on an aggregate basis, in the
servicing fee line are about 2 percentage points of headwinds a year. And while we saw that bubble in 2017,
2018, 2019, that's come back down. That ticked up and then it's been well managed back down to that 2% or so
level. And that's what we are seeing today. We're not seeing anything different than that and it's well within our
expectations.
In terms of wins, we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive
impact on the revenues, as they did this quarter. I was clear in my prepared remarks that net new business was
positive. We had some nice wins. We actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates, right, because both matter,
to your point.
The benchmark I've put out there is that we expect about $1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year to be in a good
positive direction and trajectory for net new business. But to be honest, as the CFO, I would like to see a little
more. And you've seen last year was particularly strong. This year, year-to-date, I think we're already comfortably
at that level and we still have another quarter to go. So the sales momentum continues. And what I find important
is it continues to cross both our traditional custody and accounting business and our Alpha offerings. And so, it's
been broad-based.

What I would add is on the topic of pricing, we mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we
launched a targeted repricing initiative. That is well underway, and it's focused on the areas of high value or
where costs are increasing higher than in other places. And that is intended to – and is to achieve margin
preservation.
In other words, to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas, for
example, where we have disproportionate market data and things like that. So that initiative is well underway.
When we talked to you last time, it just launched. So we were in the dozens of clients. Now, we're in
conversations with the triple-digit number. So we're pleased with that progress, too.

And has it been well-received or understood, I should say? Nobody likes price increases, but are the clients'
understanding of why this conversation has to take place?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I think understood is the right word, Gerard. I think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves.
They see what's going on. So, I think, it's been, for the most part, understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, Eric, as a follow-up, can you remind us what percentage of assets under custody or under
management are variable rate priced products, meaning your customers pay basis points on the assets under
custody. And so, therefore, to your point, when the value goes up and down, obviously, it affects revenues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. It's a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies. But a good rule of thumb is 50%, 55%
are asset under custody base, so move up and down with market. There's another 20% that – of the pricing tends
to be based on transactional activity. And we actually saw transactions, volumes, DTCC trades, wire transfers,

derivatives transaction, so forth, come down this quarter. And then, the last 20%, 25% tend to be relatively fixed
or sometimes semi-fix the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees.

Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, on BBH, I suppose it's been a while since we've
gotten a financial update on the business and how it's performed in this volatile environment year-to-date. And
clearly, there is a possibility that we have a resolution that could end up moving forward with the acquisition. So
as we think about our models here and getting those kind of aligned with how BBH is performing, anything you
can share on how the company has performed year-to-date?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. We're obviously monitoring the business performance closely, monthly, quarterly. And I think it's – you
should expect, you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago, September, as the base
case. But you could take that, Mike, and extrapolate some of what you've seen in our book of business, right?
We're an asset management-oriented custodian. You can even look at some of our peers as benchmarks.
And I think you'd find what we've seen, which is that there is a sharp boost in the NII in their book, or NII plus fees
because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients' cash, partially offset, I'd say, with some downdraft in
servicing fee rates, equity in bond markets. And then, you'd see a bit of uptick on the FX services kind of
business.
So I think it's ours, and other large custodians are a parallel to what you've seen. And so, it's something we're
considering. But as we talked about earlier, we're conscious that we need to think about this from a couple
different perspectives. But it's performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Understood. Thanks for that color, Eric. Maybe just one last cleanup one for me. How should we think
about how the unrealized losses on the AFS portfolio could accrete back over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months as
we think about your capital ratio or how that will impact the capital ratios over that time period?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Yeah. It is part of our capital forecasting now. And it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital
return estimates that we provided, not only for the fourth quarter, but also for our intentions related to next year. I
think this quarter, the accretion was worth $60 million or so of capital. And that's just the reversal of that mark
accreting back as the bonds mature.
There tends to be a little lumpiness to it, but that's the start of the accretion. And so, it did provide some amount of
modest tailwind, and we'll certainly factor that in, right. Because just like earnings create an opportunity to return
capital to shareholders, the accretion does as well, and that'll be a part of that builder capital ratios, which then we
can share back with shareholders.

Operator: Okay. Next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just to clarify. So, in the next 10 weeks, we should either expect you to say that you'll proceed with the BBH
deal, or that you won't be proceeding, and maybe there'll be an extra $2 billion buyback. Am I interpreting that
correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
What you should take away from what we've said, Mike, is that by the end of this quarter, we will have a decision
on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward. On the buyback, first, we need a board authorization for
further buyback. And we'll communicate what we're intending on buybacks after that authorization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just I know that the first question of this call was, why don't just walk away, and that's been the topic.
Let me just take the flip side, just I'm sure you've invested a lot of resources, and time, and thought into this. Is the
real issue, just the regulators? And I'm just wondering, it's like roughly what, like 10% of your size? Other G-SIFIs
are 10 times to 15 times larger. I mean, when I worked at the Fed 30 years ago, it all must be considered de
minimis, right?
I mean, it's – and I'm just trying to figure out the change. We all know the change in mindset as it relates to
mergers generally, but I'm just wondering, does this put you at a permanent strategic penalty box that you can't
pursue any mergers, or is it something unique to this deal? And I know you can't talk particulars about this deal in
general, but can you make any broader statements, like when G-SIFIs do this or G-SIFIs do that, it gets extra
scrutiny or it's not as easy to get through anymore?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2022
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Mike, what I would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal, in retrospect, probably couldn't
have come at a worst time, because if you think about the regulatory agencies, many of them, to some extent,
were going through some kind of personnel change. So, that itself has slowed things down. In some cases, it's
driven a very significant change in philosophy. Whether that change in philosophy will be permanent or not, I don't
know. I'd like to think not.
But to answer, I think the nub of your question is, did anything change for us beyond the regulatory situation? The
answer is no. I mean, we have – for all the reasons that we've stated to you going back to September of last year,
we feel like the deal is strategically compelling.
In terms of longer term, what does this mean for our position? I mean, again, that's something that we think about,
and that's something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator. And I think there's
some sympathy to all that.
But I don't want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that we're in, which is the BBH
deal. It's not all regulators. It's a subset. And it's a situation that we're going to work our way through, but work our
way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders, what it means for clients, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, last follow-up on this. Is there anything that you can do to help control the outcome at this time, or is it
simply based on the analysis by the regulators?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Well, that – I mean, we've talked about modifications to the transaction. And the modifications are meant to meet
either regulatory concern or to navigate or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory
concerns. So, that's what we're up to now.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I know you've had some M&I charges, merger integration charges over
the past few quarters. I mean, if any of that is for the BBH deal, was there anything in a walk away that you would
be refunded for? I'm guessing, the answer is no, but I just want to make sure I understand how that works.

Betsy, it's Eric. No, those are incurred charges that are about – primarily our staffing, and then some of the
service providers. But we've also – what we have done is avoided some of the – obviously, there are costs that
are continuing on deal closing, some of the advisory fees et cetera. Those have not played through there, and
those would not be incurred. So, those are kind of the base level expenses. And there's no tail on those, by and
large.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Okay. And is it possible to size how much of those were for or have been for BBH or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Since earlier this year, they primarily been around the BBH transaction work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, we've had two quarters of very strong dollar performance here, dollar strengthening, Q-on-Q. I
see it in the deck, the ins and outs on the drag on revenues, the benefit to expenses, a little bit of a drag on the
AUC/AUM volumes, you've got some benefit from volatility in the trading line. So, just wanted to get your sense of
how has the dollar strengthening, all in, impacted you? And how do you think about managing that risk, just
generally speaking? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, it's Eric. What I described to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all the currencies on our P&L
and balance sheet, but it's relatively symmetric. And I'll say, almost neutral. And I say that in EBIT terms and in
balance sheet terms, it – dollar strengthening reduces revenues, but also reduces the expenses, not in all
currencies and all the time, but it tends to have almost an EBIT-neutral impact on the P&L.
And then, on the balance sheet, you also have a similar effect where as deposits are revalued downwards in
foreign jurisdictions, so the US appreciates, so are the assets in those jurisdictions. And so, you have some
symmetry. So, by and large, it's – I'll call it, roughly neutral, which is why we don't do any particular hedging on it,
because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner, except that it makes our reporting to all
of you in the analyst and investment community a little more complicated, but that's just what needs to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And when you think about the footprint that you have today and the effort to continue to get scale in that footprint,
is the international exposure strategically important from a diversification perspective, or do you feel that the
growth outlook for the non-US markets is higher? Just wondering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Betsy, it's Ron. Let me take that. I would say that we've got a good geographic mix now. And so, the way we think
about it, in virtually, all of our locations, it's not like we're not at minimum efficient scale. But to the extent to which
we can achieve more scale there, we'd like that. I think in general, the non-US markets have continued in most

circumstances, not all, to grow faster than US markets on balance. If we could get a little bit more there, we'd like
that.

Operator: And next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but going back to BBH, given that you talk about buying back $1 billion of
stock, the deal value was $3.5 billion, that's a pretty substantial percentage. Would you still be buying the full
entity you had intended to, when you announced the deal or is there some elimination of a part of it? And flip it the
other way, could you buy just a piece of it, or is it only available as a whole thing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Vivek, it's Eric. The kind of the outlines, the perimeter of the deal with Brown Brothers hasn't really changed. It's
around their Investment Services business. That's the business that we're attracted to and that's the one that
they'd like to transact. So, there's no -there's not been any real change there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes. And Vivek, we were never buying the whole business, and there was no...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
What I meant was, the whole Investment Services business. Could you buy a piece of it since it's different
geographies, given the regulatory complexity to sort of – if there are geographies that are more attractive and
more difficult to replicate on your own?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, I suppose that's something we could explore Vivek. Then, the attraction goes down even more so – and not
clear that, that accomplishes what Brown Brothers itself is trying to accomplish which is, they'd like to exit the
business, not have even a smaller bit than they already have now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Ron, I want to go back to a different topic. You mentioned about the price increase, discussions you're having.
And you said, the operative word is understood with your clients. Should I interpret understood as understood and
agreeing to it; or understood, but not necessarily open to it and shopping it around with other providers?

So, I would say, again, this has been highly targeted, Vivek. So, it's not like we've said, there's an X percent
across the board kind of thing. We've really tied it to, one, where our costs are under the most pressure; and two,
where there's high-value added delivered to the client. And so, I think you should interpret understood as we
understand why you're asking for this. There's certainly some talk around it and is that the right number, et cetera.
But I would say, in more cases than not – but far more cases than that, we're getting agreement on it.
