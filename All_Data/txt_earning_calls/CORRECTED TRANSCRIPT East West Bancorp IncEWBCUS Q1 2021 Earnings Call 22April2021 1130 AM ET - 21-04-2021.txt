Thank you, Julianna. Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation.
This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 net income of $205 million, or $1.44 per share, which was up by 25%
quarter-over-quarter. The first quarter was a strong start to the year. Highlights include strong loan and deposit
growth, robust revenue growth and decreasing operating expenses, all driving pre-tax, pre-provision growth of
4%, or 17% annualized. In the first quarter, we earned $262 million of pre-tax, pre-provision income on total
revenue of $427 million.
Furthermore, due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and stable asset quality, we did not record any
provision for credit loss in the first quarter. We returned 1.5% on average assets, 15.6% on average equity, and

17.2% on average tangible equity for the quarter. Our attractive returns reflect a strong financial performance in
the first quarter of 2021.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, total loans reached a record of $39.6
billion, growing by $1.2 billion, or 13% annualized from December 31, 2020. Paycheck Protection Program loans
totaled $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2021.
During the first quarter, the company funded 5,075 new PPP loans totaling $828 million. Since the PPP program
launched in 2020, East West Bank funded a total of 12,517 loans totaling $2.6 billion through March 31, 2021.
Excluding PPP, total loans grew by 8% linked-quarter annualized in the first quarter, at the top of our previous
guidance range for the year. Accordingly, based on current pipelines and economic trends, we are updating our
loan growth outlook for the full year to 8% compared with a range of 6% to 8% previously.
First quarter average loan of $38.7 billion grew by 11% linked-quarter annualized or 9% annualized excluding
PPP. Growth was broad base across all our major loan portfolios with the strongest growth from residential
mortgage. Deposit growth for the quarter was exceptional. As of March 31, 2021, total deposits reached a record
of $49.5 billion, growing by $4.7 billion or 42% annualized from December 31.
Non-interest-bearing deposit grew 65% annualized to a record $18.9 billion as of March 31, 2021, making up 38%
of total deposits as of March 31, up from 36% a quarter ago and up from 31% a year ago. We are pleased with
the deposit and related growth in deposit account fees, which are up 47% year-over-year to $15.4 million. We
have continually invested in our digital banking platform and treasury management product capabilities, allowing
us to win large customers with more complex cash management needs.
At the same time, we have developed deposit products tailored to meet the needs of our small business
customers, a segment that has been growing nicely for some time now. Our ability to compete for and win both
large and small deposit customers laid a good foundation for future growth, as the economy recovers and
business activity increases.
Turning to slide 5. You can see our strong capital ratio. As of March 31, 2021, we had a common equity Tier 1
ratio of 12.7% and a total capital ratio of 14.3%, which provides us with a meaningful capacity to support all of our
customers in their growth and expansion plans as the economy reopens and rebounds from COVID-related
restrictions.
East West Board of Directors has declared second quarter 2021 dividends for the company's common stock. The
common stock cash dividend of $0.33 is payable on May 17, 2021 to stockholders of record on May 3, 2021.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding, excluding PPP,
were $12 billion as of March 31, 2021, declining $55 million or 2% annualized from December 31, 2020. Our total
C&I commitment was $17.2 billion as of March 31, 2021, a quarter-over-quarter increase of $137 million or 3%
annualized. The decline in outstanding balance reflects paydown in January. But on an average basis, C&I loans
excluding PPP grew by 5% annualized in the first quarter. We are comfortable that our C&I loan growth will
accelerate through the year based on our year-to-year – year-to-date growth in commitments, current pipelines
and a strengthening economy. As you know, it takes time for commitments to materialize into balance
outstanding.
Slides 7 and 8 show essential details of our commercial real estate portfolio. Total commercial real estate loans
were $15.1 billion as of March 31, 2021. This portfolio grew by $280.5 million or 8% annualized from December

31, 2020. On an average basis, total CRE loans grew by 6% annualized in the first quarter. This run rate of
growth is stronger than we had originally expected, because of higher origination volume, [ph] our total (00:09:21)
traditional CRE lending customers, as well as lower than anticipated payoffs.
We expect the CRE payoffs to tick up in the second quarter, but for the full year, we are comfortable that our total
CRE loan growth will be supported by continued good demand from our customers as the economy reopens and
rebounds.
In slides 9 and 10, we provide details regarding our single-family residential loans and home equity lines. During
the first quarter, we originated $1.1 billion of residential mortgage loans, an increase of 5% quarter-over-quarter
and 45% year-over-year. This was a record quarter of residential mortgage originations for East West, and we are
seeing the momentum continue into April.
Single-family residential loans were $8.5 billion as of March 31, 2021. This portfolio grew by $338 million or 17%
annualized from December 31. On an average basis, single-family residential loans grew by 16% annualized in
the first quarter. Home equity lines outstanding were $1.7 billion as of March 31, up $147 million or 37%
annualized from December 31.
Including unfunded commitments, total commitments on home equity lines were $3.6 billion as of March 31, up by
32% linked-quarter annualized. The utilization rate remained steady at 48%. On an average basis, home equity
lines grew by 28% annualized in the first quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics on slide 11. Our criticized loans were $1.2 billion as of
March 31, or 3.1% of total loans, essentially unchanged from $1.2 billion as of December 31 or 3.2% of total
loans. Quarter-over-quarter, special mention loans decreased to $504 million as of March 31, down from $565
million as of December 31. Classified loans increased to $713 million, up from $653 million as of year-end. Non-
performing assets were $258 million, or 45 basis points of total assets as of March 31 compared with $235
million, or 45 basis points of total assets as of December 31.
Classified loans increased to $713 million, up from $653 million as of year-end. Non-performing assets were $258
million or 45 basis points of total assets as of March 31 compared with $235 million or 45 basis points of total
assets as of December 31.
New migration into adversely graded loans in the first quarter was limited resulting in stable criticized loans
quarter-over-quarter. Oil and gas exposures continue to be the largest single concentration in our performing
assets and the operating backdrop for this sector is improving. Outside of oil and gas, we do not see systemic
issues in our loan portfolio.
Furthermore, at $608 million as of March 31, 2021, we believe that our allowance for loan losses is sufficient to
absorb losses in our loan portfolio as well as incremental reserve build needed for new loan growth. We do not
expect to record any provision for loan losses for the remainder of the year.

On slide 12, we present the components of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses totaled
$608 million as of March 31 or 162 basis points of loans held for investment excluding PPP compared with $620
million or 168 basis points as of December 31, and compared with $483 million or 139 basis points on day one
post CECL. The quarter-over-quarter reduction in allowance largely reflects an improved macroeconomic
forecast.
Net charge-offs in the first quarter were $13 million compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter. The first
quarter net charge-off ratio was 14 basis points of average loans, annualized, an improvement of 6 basis points
from the fourth quarter of 2020. This improvement primarily reflects a decrease in commercial real estate charge-
offs. During the first quarter, we recorded no provision for loan losses compared to $24 million in the fourth
quarter.
And now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide 13. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement which I'll discuss in more detail in the following slides. First quarter income tax expense was
$30.5 million and effective tax rate was 13% compared with $49 million and 23% for the fourth quarter. First
quarter income tax expense and effective tax rate reflect the benefit of a higher amount of tax credit investments
and discrete items compared with the prior quarter. Also, fourth quarter income tax expense included $8 million
related to DC Solar tax credit investments.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 14 through 17 starting
with average balance sheet growth. First quarter average loans of $38.7 billion grew by $1 billion or 11% linked
quarter annualized. The growth rate accelerated from the fourth quarter and was broad-based across the major
loan categories with the strongest growth from residential mortgage. First quarter average deposits of $47.8 billion
grew by $3.4 billion or 31% linked quarter annualized. All deposit categories grew led by growth in non-interest-
bearing demand deposits at a rate of 44% annualized. With a strong deposit growth, our average loan to deposit
ratio was 81% in the first quarter, down from 85% in the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, we deployed some cash into debt securities available for sale and also repo assets. On a
quarterly average basis, securities AFS increased by $1.4 billion and repo assets increased by $204 million.
During the second quarter of 2021, $400 million of our FHLB funding carrying effective interest rate of 2.25% will
mature which we expect to pay off.
Turning to slide 15, first quarter 2021 net interest income of $354 million grew by 8% linked quarter annualized
and the net interest margin was 2.71%, a decrease of 6 basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding income
related to PPP loans, our first quarter adjusted net interest income of $339 million grew by 7% linked quarter
annualized. Net interest income related to PPP loans was $15 million in the first quarter compared with $14
million in the fourth quarter.
As of March 31, we had $34 million of PPP loan deferred fees to accrete into income. The 6 basis points quarter-
over-quarter decrease in the first quarter GAAP NIM breaks down as follows: plus 5 basis points from a lower cost
of interest-bearing deposits, plus 2 basis points from more DDA in the funding mix, offset by minus 7 basis points
from lower loan yields and minus 6 basis points from excess liquidity due to the strong deposit growth.
Turning to slide 16, first quarter average loan yield was 3.58%. And excluding the impact of PPP, the adjusted
loan yield was 3.60%, down by 9 basis points quarter-over-quarter from 3.69%, reflecting the impact of low
interest rate in our own portfolio.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Turning to slide 17, our cost of deposits continues to decline as maturing higher price CDs reprice to current
market rates. Our average cost of deposits for the first quarter dropped to 18 basis points, down from 25 basis
points in the fourth quarter. The spot rate of total deposits as of March 31, 2021, was 16 basis points. Our first
quarter average cost of interest-bearing deposits dropped to 30 basis points, down from 40 basis points in the
fourth quarter. The spot rate of interest-bearing deposits as of March 31 was 26 basis points. The quarter-over-
quarter improvement was primarily driven by the repricing of CDs as well as by a decrease in the cost of money
market accounts.
The average cost of CDs in the first quarter was 50 basis points, a meaningful drop of 24 basis points from 74
basis points in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we originated or renewed $5.4 billion of domestic US CDs at
a blended rate of 20 basis points and a weighted average term of four months. We have $964 million of CDs
maturing in the second quarter at a blended rate of 62 basis points and another $817 million in the third quarter at
a blended rate of 61 basis points.
Moving on to fee income on slide 18, total non-interest income in the first quarter was $73 million, up from $70
million in the fourth quarter. First quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $55 million, growing by
14% annualized from the fourth quarter. Higher foreign exchange income, wealth management and deposit
account fees reflected growth in customer-driven transactions for these business lines. Fee income growth
momentum is continuing into the second quarter, and we expect these business lines to show strength for the full
year.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in interest rate contracts and other derivative income reflected a favorable
change in the credit valuation adjustment due to the increase in benchmark long-term interest rates and an
improved macroeconomic outlook. The decline in interest rate contracts revenue reflects the lower customer
transaction volume and demand in the current environment.
Moving on to slide 19, first quarter non-interest expense was $191 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits
and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was $165 million
in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.6 million quarter-over-quarter. Reductions in overall operating expenses more
than offset increased compensation and employee benefit expense which is typically higher in the first quarter
due to payroll taxes and other payroll-related expenses. Year-over-year, adjusted non-interest expense increased
by 3%.
In the first quarter, adjusted efficiency ratio was 38.7% compared with 39.8% in the fourth quarter. Over the past
five quarters, our efficiency ratio has ranged from 38.4% to 40.8% despite operating headwinds from the COVID
pandemic, related economic slowdown and near zero interest rates.
And with that, I'll now review our updated full year outlook for 2021 on slide 20. For the full year of 2021,
compared to our full year 2020 results, we expect that year-over-year loan growth excluding PPP will be
approximately 8% narrowing to the upper end of our prior range of 6% to 8%. Year-over-year, adjusted net
interest income growth excluding PPP will be generally in line with loan growth on a full year basis.
In the current interest rate environment, we are focused on net interest income growth which will be primarily
driven by loan growth for our bank. Underpinning our interest income assumptions is the current forward interest
rate curve. Adjusted non-interest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization up 5% year-over-
year narrowing to the upper end of our prior range of 3% to 5%.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
This change parallels to the update of our loan growth outlook and largely reflects growth in compensation
expense and higher computer software amortization expense, as we amortize previously capitalized technology
investments. Compensation expense will reflect loan production and revenue growth for the year.
Our updated outlook for revenue expense translates to higher pre-tax pre-provision income growth for 2021
compared to our prior expectations. I would add that we also expect to see stable to modestly improving operating
leverage for the year compared to 2020. Based on our macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth outlook, we do
not expect to book provision for loan credit losses for the full year.
Finally, full year 2021 effective tax rate of approximately 15% including the impact of tax credit investment
unchanged from our prior outlook. There will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to the timing of tax credit
investments placed into service.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.

I guess my first question is just around – I'm trying to figure out the potential for upside to your loan growth
outlook, Dominic. If you could help us just across the three major buckets, one, on the residential mortgage side,
is there any reason to believe that momentum slows on C&I? What are the industries that you think will drive loan
growth? And then on CRE, it sounded a lot more constructive than you did in the last two to six months. So, is
there the reopening or what you are hearing from clients makes you feel better about CRE activity for the year?
Thank you.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Three – yeah, the three buckets. So, residential mortgages and home equity – in fact, I've been predicting it
to slow down for the last four or five years, and I haven't succeeded. We've been having a very strong momentum
in the residential mortgages and home equity lines of business for actually quite a few years now. I said almost
we're getting tired of setting record every quarter after quarter.
I think that, obviously, these low interest rate help, but for what we've seen so far, I mean our momentum has
continued to grow strong. And I look at even so far in April, it's kept going. And at this stage right now, I just don't
see the residential mortgage to come down much simply because we are getting good momentum both on
refinance from home purchases, and our home equity lines are picking up really strong. So, at this stage right
now, I think that should be looking pretty good to continue on for a while.
On the C&I side, I think that the good news really is that we are getting new customers. We continue to getting
really high-quality new customers. I think since the PPP back in April of 2020, we were successfully getting some
very high-quality customers because of a bit more chaotic situation [ph] now in (00:26:06) some of the other
banks that allow us to able to demonstrate that our service level are better.
So from that standpoint, when we also looked at in terms of our C&I side is to grow from many different verticals,
many different geographical regions. So it's pretty evenly distributed and the commitments continue to grow. So,
of course, in the first quarter, we haven't got that picked up much from the outstanding balance standpoint of view
simply because we always have a solid first quarter. That's the nature of our C&I business.
So we do expect that in particular as we highlighted at Irene's guidance, in the third and fourth quarter, we'll be
most likely seeing more pickup from not only just because the economy would open up more, it's because the
nature of the business tend to have more drawdown in the third and fourth quarter. So that's been going great.
On the CRE side, I've highlighted in my sort of like presentation earlier is that the anticipated payoff for first
quarter didn't happen as high as we expected. We do expect that maybe it will be happening in the second
quarter, but all in all, I would say that we are seeing good momentum from our traditional core customers in the
CRE sector where many of our customers now are feeling more positive. And in fact they see opportunities and in
fact they started even in the late third and fourth quarter of last year and they continue to look for investment
opportunities. And this allows us the opportunity to actually see some decent growth in our CRE so far. So we are
watching the progress. And as of today, I would say that we are comfortable – very comfortable with our guidance
that we laid out so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Go it. Helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up, in terms of just the deposit growth, it was very strong this
quarter. Do you have a breakdown of how much of the growth came from the US versus Hong Kong and Greater
China? Do you see that as continuing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I will would say – I mean because as you know, Hong Kong and China is just a very small part of our deposit total.
So most of the deposits are coming from the United States.

Do you see that as continuing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Well, I looked at it. Well, when you look at these 40-some-odd percent annualized growth rate or 65% like
annualized growth of DDA, those are kind of things that we think has a lot to do with the current economic
environment. But what I wanted to share is that I don't necessarily pay too much attention to this sort of like big
deposit growth quarter-by-quarter which has been happening for the last couple of quarters. But I would say that
I'm much more interested to look at, do we have high quality customers coming into the bank. Do we have these
new – do we have high growth in the new customers that originated by our branches, by our commercial lending
officer and the commercial bankers throughout US and China.
And so far, that's been happening. In fact, our treasury management, cash management products team are
working day and night overtime, opening account, setting up all these online banking and digital banking
requirements for our customers because we are getting more new customers. And that to me is very encouraging.
And we are hoping that that continued growth will sustain. And that will allow us to really have a much more
meaningful core customer base going forward.
And this is above and beyond just the current environment because many banks also have high deposit balance
growth for the last quarter. But that's what I am really focusing on, how many new customers we have and what
kind of customer are they. These customer call to have a sustainability going forward. And those are the one I'm
paying attention. And I feel pretty good right now that we will continue to see growth from this set of new
customers. And together with existing customers, who are expanding their relationship with us because our core
capability from product and technology-wise are getting better which allow us to be able to take on more complex
deposit setup.

Ken Zerbe Q

I guess first, probably a pretty easy one, in terms of the provision expense guidance, I just want to make sure I
understand it correctly. So you're not going to book a provision expense for the full year. Are you saying that it is
10


East West Bancorp, Inc.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
generally going to be zero for each of the next quarters or could it potentially be meaningfully negative if you do
end up releasing a significant amount of reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And that's a great question. I don't have a crystal ball honestly, but with our guidance of the zero as we kind of
project out and we model out right now, the likelihood of having to add net provision is very low at this point in
time. And that's really what drove the change that we made to our guidance. The min-max of what might happen
each quarter certainly that could vary and certainly it is possible that will have a negative provision. But
nonetheless I'm very comfortable at this point in time with the zero provision for the full year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up, in terms of the PPP amortization with $34 million remaining,
but you did $15 million this quarter, it seems that it could potentially fall pretty noticeably on a go-forward basis.
Can you just remind us what your amortization schedule is of that $34 million, is it a straight line over five years or
is it more heavily weighted towards the front end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It's more heavily weighted towards the front end. And I'll also add we've had a fair amount of pay-downs as
well if we look at that in the first quarter. There was a period of time where we stopped doing the PPP loan
forgiveness, but we're back up on that. In fact, actually last week, we started opening our portal for PPP
forgiveness, for PPP round two as well.

growth. Do you have any updated thoughts about deploying that given kind of where rates have moved to today
and/or any additional analysis of sort of the stickiness of those deposits going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. Certainly, in the first quarter with kind of the rate movement and our comfort level as far as
the deposits, the growth that we've had, the growth that we expect in the pipeline, that was some of the decisions
and factors that we considered as we redeployed some of that cash that we had been building into securities and
to repos.
And keep in mind, obviously also the part of that consideration was the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. And
also keeping in mind with the securities that we did purchase and the repos, we did extend
duration, but being cognizant of the fact that we didn't want to extend too much. So the repos, LIBOR plus 130
basis points kind of pricing. And then the securities as well, largely, what we've been buying are treasuries, GSE
kind of step-ups, things like that where we're comfortable that we're earning a little bit more money, cash today –
on the cash today. But not extending duration too much in this kind of environment. On a go-forward basis,
evaluating kind of our liquidity, the deposit growth, that's certainly something that we'll continue to look at and
evaluate over the course of the year.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the question. If you could just kind of review kind of the puts and takes on the non-
interest income and the FX derivatives service charges, we've been expecting those kind of come in fairly
materially off a very strong Q4 and they actually headed higher. What should we be looking for in the balance of
the year or the next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So I think if you look at the accompanying debt that we have on page 18, I think we do a nice job of
breaking out the fee income from a customer transaction perspective, reconciling back to the GAAP. So if you
look at each line items, foreign – FX income, we have seen a lot more kind of transaction volume and number of
clients. So in the prepared remarks, we talked about it how that we expect that that to continue the momentum
particularly on a year-over-year basis so far in the second quarter, we're doing pretty well as well.
On the wealth management side, same thing. At various points in 2020 with the pandemic, there wasn't a lot of
customer activity. We saw more interest. We've also kind of expanded and have some great kind of product

offerings for our customers that they like and that has certainly helped as well. I would say also on with a strong
deposit growth that Dominic spoke about and we talked about in the prepared remarks, the GTS-related deposit
account fees continued to grow and we expect that to continue to grow over the course of the year as well. So
really the [ph] IRSC (00:38:00) contract, the customer revenue – related revenue, given the kind of the rate
environment, that's probably the category where I don't see this kind of level of growth for the full year. But other
areas, we're very positive year-over-year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So I just wanted to add again it's like – when you look at non-interest income, foreign exchange and global
treasury services, cash management and the consumer branch fees, these are the type – and wealth
management, these are all customer-related type of fee income and that's what I'm talking about earlier that we
are getting new customers. And we are getting new customers, well, obviously because of the great dedicated
service from our associates throughout the US and China. More importantly, because of the investment that we
made from digital banking to FX to cash management, et cetera, these investment that we made allow us to now
have the capability to take on some of those additional sort of like product capability that we have now to allow us
to earn these additional fees. And have we not had some of these technological [ph] enhancement deals
(00:39:39), we wouldn't be able to generate ECs even though we might have these customers before.
But some of these customers are not able to transact everything with East West before because we did not have
the technical capability. But the last few years, slowly gradually, we're building up that capability and we are
seeing that result now in our non-interest income. And I would expect that will continue to grow, and that's why it's
important for us to also continue to invest.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I'll also add. Last year including largely in lending fees, we had warrant income of about $11 million which we
don't expect to occur. So aside from that, we do expect good growth in fee income.

Was wondering if you could talk about where new loan yields are today across your major loan buckets as well as
new securities yields just given a steeper curve. And then would be glad to hear where the overall average yield
was on those securities purchases in 1Q.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Hold one minute. Let me get that for you. My computer locked up. So while I've got it, just give me one

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Managing Director, Director of Research, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Oh, sure. Just where the securities purchases were this quarter in terms of just the overall yield.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That I don't need to look up. So the securities that we purchase generally are about [ph] 150, 160 basis
points (00:41:35), so lower than kind of the yield that we had before. But as I said earlier, we wanted to just make
sure from a duration perspective we were comfortable. And then give me one minute here. If you look at kind of
the loan yields, currently new quarter loan yields, generally for C&I, the loans about kind of 4% probably including
fees. For commercial real estate, we're at probably [ph] flying (00:42:04) flat. And then consumer loans in total
were about 375 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Managing Director, Director of Research, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC

Okay. Great. And then you guys have plenty of capital today. You still have that buyback outstanding. Was just
wondering what could prompt you to take a closer look at that buyback as we go through the year, if you have any
specific capital targets you're looking at, just any color there would be great. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are having pretty decent growth so far. And so, I mean, this whole idea about having a little bit more capital
than our peers is – well, during the pandemic, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, when everybody
panicked, we didn't have to panic as much because we have plenty of capital. So, now I think when the economy
starts rebounding, we have very nice growth, as you can see our huge deposit and even loan growth is pretty
strong.
And so we really looked at is that it's nice to have that kind of capital that, in case, [ph] will get (00:43:44) even
stronger, we've got plenty of capital to support that. So at this stage right now, I think that we are going to stay
[ph] put (00:43:50) and see how it goes. Keep in mind though even with where our capital is today, as I just
shared, that we have a return of equity – tangible equity of 17.2%, which is not bad. And that's the way we see it
when we [ph] can't pull (00:44:11) in this kind of like return, we don't need to spend too much time in terms of
managing the capital too tight.

Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to touch on credit. I was a little bit surprised to see the oil and gas [ph] ACI
(00:44:42) actually go up despite the better backdrop, did see a little bit of migration. Can you maybe talk to the
outlook in that book and the reserve for that kind of going forward for this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. So the reserve calculation did increase a little bit. Part of it is correlated to a little bit
adverse migration into substandard and then also specific reserves that we had for some of the non-accrual
loans. So if you look at 3/31, the total reserve that we had for the oil and gas portfolio was $113 million for the
outstanding loans compared to $111 million as of December 31. Overall, I would say that we're continuing to work
through the portfolio. Generally, the outlook is more positive, but certainly, we want to be prudent and kind of
conservative with our reserving there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And I think you touched on the China theme earlier. But just could we maybe get a pulse on the outlook for
cross-border activity maybe for the second half of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. The cross-border activity is going very well. In fact, again, it's getting back to – it's a combination of people
and technology again. What we've noticed is that, despite the fact that we – as I shared earlier that most of
deposit growth is coming from US and then the loan growth mainly from US. Interesting enough, quite a few of
those deposits have that cross-border elements into it and quite a bit of – even the loans have a bit of cross-
border elements into it, is because we actually have many of our customers that are doing business in US but that
have either ownership from China or Hong Kong.
And so we are doing a lot more business now in terms of a customer that requires maybe us providing a loans
and commercial deposit setup in US. In addition to that, they have business in China and Hong Kong that also set
up additional commercial banking relationship with us and also have either guarantee support of letter of credit to
show up the credit strength for US. And it's this kind of like a cross-border type of transaction that East West is
very proud to have the ability to be able to handle it in 24/7 and different time zones. And we also have the
compliance, regulatory expertise that can understand the rule and regulations in different regions.
And so, we are going to continue to be able to get these type of business that, in general, from a East West point
of view that we do not have that kind of competition against our peer banks in US. And more importantly, we
would end up underwriting credit to have substantially less actual risk versus perceived risk from other banks,
who don't know anything about this cross-border kind of business.
So in that standpoint, we will continue to expect that we will do well going forward in our sort of like bridge
between East and West type of value proposition. And we're really looking at it in the next two years, there'll be
more opportunities to come for us.

Good morning, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at credit and losses with the 15 basis points this quarter, do you think that we've turned the corner on loss
content, and should we be looking at this as sort of the high watermark for expectations given the broader
economic backdrop, or could we see more episodic losses as we go through the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think that from our perspective, what we're most comfortable with is really looking at our entire loan
portfolio overall that when we see that our criticized loans has been stable and we also continue to review our
loan portfolio one sector at a time. We recently just have another CRE loan review and then we look at these
different industry verticals on C&I and so forth.
And based on our review, we feel pretty confident that our loan portfolio overall has – in terms of credit quality has
been very good, and in terms of any kind of major concern that would it get even worse. At this stage right now, I
would say, it is not very likely. There's always going to be occasional one or two loans that we ended up charging
off. But in terms of overall, do we have enough reserve for our sort of like loan portfolio? I would say that we're
very, very confident that we have plenty of reserves and allowances to cover any potential losses in the future.

Hey. Good morning. How are you doing? Just a quick housekeeping on the tax rate and the am expense. Any
color on the cadence for the rest of the year? I think $100 million was kind of the thought on the expense
previously?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly, and that we've talked about this before, depending on the timing of the investment that can be a
little bounce around. But at this point in time, our – and with the tax rate, the effective tax rate that we're
assuming, it also includes $113 million for the full year of credits, and $115 million from amortization perspective
for full year.

Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning. First question, just on the core NII guide. It looks like in order to get to that 8%, you need
assets to grow faster than loans. And that, just wondering if that phenomenon could put some additional pressure
on your core NIM? Or do you think going from cash into securities can help mitigate that? Just trying to get a
sense for whether or not we troughed in the core NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a great question. We do think that the NII growth will correlate with the loan growth. And then,
as you pointed out with the kind of redeployment of some of that excess cash into securities, that will help from an
NII perspective and also in NIM. I'll also point out that our continued kind of repricing on the funding side, the
deposits, the [indiscernible] (00:52:54) also helps as well. So at this point in time, although it's hard to predict
exactly where that NIM is going to fall out based on largely at this point, the deposits and the excess liquidity,
we're comfortable that our margin will stabilize and could kind of even modestly increase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then last one for me. Just on the – on slide 16 of the deck, your C&I average loan yield of 336 basis
points this quarter ex-PPP, just given your growth prospects, I guess how can you – I guess how do you feel
comfortable, I guess, pricing at that level? How do you ensure that you're getting paid for the risk you're taking, I
guess, is my question?

Yeah. I think with rates being so low, that's a question that we have every day. Every day we talk about it with our
RMs, our team leaders and the credit team and the Treasurer. I think that's not just C&I, it's also CRE as well for
us. As you know, single-family and HELOC, the credit quality is so extraordinary, I'm not concerned there. And
then from a product offering perspective, also we have a unique product. So, for C&I and CRE, honestly, I think
that's also – we're being very careful to make sure from a overall return perspective, from kind of a credit quality
perspective, we are careful with that and with that's reflected in kind of the growth numbers as well that we're
expecting.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I had a couple of questions. Good morning. First, in terms of the C&I growth and just kind of a general taking
temperature of that customer base, could you comment on kind of what degree growth is coming from the
specialty verticals, and if any of those specialty verticals that are getting particularly more active?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we've been fortunate. I mean, I think, since, I would say, the latter part of third quarter of last year, we were
really seeing a positive momentum from just pretty much every single vertical, every – so every month, there's
another team that come out stronger than the other one. It's a nice little internal competition, which is really
healthy. But if I look at in the first quarter, from a loan outstanding point of view, I would say that the few that
stand out for the first quarter for C&I loan outstanding, loan growth will be mainly entertainment, healthcare,
technology and a little bit of the cross-border business.
So now – but in terms of commitment, so some of them done well in terms of booking commitment, they just
couldn't get anything funded. Like, for example, private equity capital call lines, they got some nice commitment.
They just haven't been able to get their loan funded. But in time, you would think that some of these private equity
funds they raise money to invest. So in time, you would think that they would start investing.
So I would expect that different quarter will be a different mix. At this stage, I'm pretty comfortable that different
sectors are going to be doing quite well other than in the oil and gas that we decided to really just slow down and
continue to have the balance to come down to less than $1 billion. And that's what we've been working on and it's
been working so far.

Got it. Thank you. And then in terms of the provision guide, kind of a follow-up question there, if you assume 8%
growth ex-PPP and kind of a zero provision over the course. That seems to get you pretty close the day one
CECL allowance plus or minus [ph] $138 million, $140 million (00:57:14). Does that – has there been any
changes that could maybe longer term drive that allowance below the CECL day one, or is that kind of the glide
path to more of a base level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. My math works out the same as yours. Certainly, I think they're depending on kind of what happens largely
to the forecast, I think it could drive lower. If we look at it as a 3/31 versus day one CECL, near term, the drivers
such as unemployment that are certainly higher today, but when we look at the forecast over multi-years, it's
better. GDP growth is also something over the next couple years looks to be better. So there are other drivers. I
think that, especially if they improve, could drive that lower, but certainly, that's something we're looking at very
carefully.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. My first question is kind of a combo question between expenses and loan. So expenses were down in
the quarter, but the guide was raised to the upper end of the range to 5% from 3% to 5%. And you mentioned that
it's driven by growth in compensation related to loan production and computer software expense. I guess, the
question is, are you hiring on the loan team side of things or is the loan growth that you're expecting more a
function of increased commitments and pipelines from the existing teams?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We do – we have higher additional people. I wouldn't say that we have made a significant hiring. I think that I
would say the vast majority of our growth is coming from our existing team.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And I'll just add, and part of that commentary is really the point that if we look at it, payroll is up. Also when
we look at kind of the revenue from – and the expectations for growth on the lending side, the fee income side, we
are also increasing our bonus pool that we've set aside given that our expectations, our revenue and net income
will be up considerably year-over-year. And if you look at it, I mean the year-over-year increase from the first
quarter, this quarter to last year is about 3%. So, hopefully, that gives you some perspective around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And the other thing, the last year is not what I call a normal year. Had last year has been relatively normal, I would
think that the incremental increase would not be as much at all, simply because last year that we have reduced
expenses quite a bit, so everything is relative.
