Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before I
begin my remarks regarding this quarter's earnings, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent and tragic
deaths of our Specialty Lending Division CEO, Jonathan Rosen; his assistant, Lauren Harrington, his 14-year-old
daughter, Ali, and Ali's friend Julia. All four were killed in a plane crash on October 8 shortly after takeoff from a
private airport in Atlanta. Many of you have likely heard us mention Jonathan's name or may have even met him,
and you've certainly heard us talk about the extensive impact he has made on our company since we acquired his
life insurance premium finance company, Entaire Global One in 2016.
In addition to exceeding expectations in growing his premium finance division, he also oversaw our asset-based
lending team and built out a world class structured lending business. But as successful as he was in his work, he
was even more passionate about his family and helping others, especially evident through his Rosen Family
Foundation that promotes financial empowerment across the socioeconomic spectrum. His assistant, Lauren, was
equally dedicated to her work and to impacting others.
As you can imagine, our entire work family is dealing with tremendous shock and sadness over this unimaginable
loss. But Jonathan built an amazingly talented team that is doing a remarkable job of carrying on under difficult
circumstances. Jonathan would have wanted it no other way and would have been the first to acknowledge that
all of his business success was more of a product of his team rather than himself. I am not sure I agree, but I am
confident in the team he has built to carry his vision forward. Please join us in keeping the families, friends and
colleagues of all lost in your thoughts and prayers.
Now let's shift to our third quarter results. We are delivering on our growth objectives, as evidenced by the period
end loans, core operating deposits, and broad-based fee income growth. At the same time, we have maintained
good expense discipline while continuing to invest in longer term initiatives and have managed through the
challenging interest rate environment by strategically investing excess liquidity while continuing to lower the
overall cost of deposits.
Loan growth was extremely strong for the quarter as funded commercial loan production increased almost 70%
versus the previous quarter, which more than offset the ongoing elevated levels of payoffs and paydowns. Fee
income was up $8 million or 8% versus the second quarter with wealth and capital markets income posting strong
growth as well as core banking fees returning to more normalized levels post-COVID. Our treasury and payments
team set a new high bar in terms of new production at $10.6 million year-to-date, surpassing its full-year 2020
totals during the month of September.
We also continue to deliver on our Synovus Forward initiatives, which reached the pre-tax run rate benefit of
approximately $100 million by quarter end, and we're making great progress in planning for the additional $75
million worth of benefits to be delivered by the end of 2022. Synovus Forward represents our ongoing innovation
and profitable growth mindset, but it will also drive our efficiency efforts in order to ensure we deliver on our
sustainable top quartile financial performance objectives.
On the efficiency front, additional branch consolidation is underway with four additional branches scheduled for
closure by year-end, and we will continue to rationalize the branch network as we reinvent the retail delivery
model. The efficiency efforts will enhance returns but also allow us to further our investment in specialized talent
to build out new businesses and product lines. Through strategic hires this quarter, we have expanded our
specialty lending coverage to restaurant services, strengthened our middle market Florida presence, and
announced our expansion into the corporate and investment banking segment.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
We continue to make progress on our efforts to digitize our business. Through the third quarter, we have migrated
90% of our clients onto Synovus Gateway, our commercial portal and usage of My Synovus, our consumer
platform indicates that digital usage continues to expand with an additional 10% increase in enrollment and active
users. Moreover, a concerted effort has led to a 43% increase in paperless enrollment in 2021.
We recognized that many of these advancements are table stakes in our industry and therefore we are focusing
additional resources on more transformational opportunities. Efforts are underway to expand our digital
engagement through insights. We are also expanding the solutions we offer our ISO and ISV clients and are
working on the next generation of fully integrated treasury solutions.
These and other initiatives are all focused on delivering new sources of revenue in the coming quarters and years
ahead. Our strategic plan forward balances our investments in both core and transformational initiatives in order
to generate both short- and long-term returns while building on our core differentiation principles.
Now, let's take a look at the financials for the quarter. On slide 3, we've included some key financial highlights for
the quarter. I'd like to begin with loan growth which increased $923 million excluding changes in PPP balances.
As mentioned previously, record levels of funded commercial production drove the growth for the quarter.
We expect this momentum to carry into the fourth quarter as commercial pipelines remain robust. Quality deposit
growth continued in the third quarter, including an increase in core transaction deposits of $1 billion. We continue
to take advantage of this liquidity environment to focus on remixing our deposit base and along with strategic
repricing, this has helped lower the overall cost of deposits by an additional 3 basis points to 0.13%.
We continue to experience balance augmentation, but a core focus on operating accounts has led to DDA and
NOW production to increase 34% versus the prior quarter. Jamie will provide additional details regarding the
balance sheet, but our goal remains consistent in this environment, attracting and deepening core relationships.
Total adjusted revenue of $500 million increased 2% from the prior quarter, while adjusted expenses declined $1
million to $267 million. This resulted in a 6% increase in adjusted pre-provision net revenue quarter-on-quarter.
An $8 million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted from the provision expense associated with strong
loan growth being more than offset by a reduction in life of loan loss estimates. Adjusted net income was $178
million or $1.20 diluted earnings per share. As we return to a position of growth, we have done so with strong
credit, liquidity, and capital metrics. The net charge-offs ratio declined 6 basis points this quarter to 0.22%, while
the NPL and NPA ratios each fell 1 basis point. The ACL ratio was down 12 basis points, excluding PPP loans
ending the quarter at 1.42%. And the CET1 ratio declined 12 basis points to 9.63% and remained slightly above
our stated range.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Jamie to provide more details on the financials. Jamie?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Starting with slide 4, we ended the quarter with total assets of $55.5 billion and loans of $38.3
billion. Total loans, excluding PPP balances, grew $923 million, up 3% from the prior quarter led by growth in C&I
and third-party consumer loans. PPP balances declined to $818 million. In the third quarter, we had record
commercial loan production. However, transaction activity remained elevated, which led to a $500 million increase
in payoffs, primarily in the CRE portfolio.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Regional economic data as well as client conversations continue to give us a cautiously optimistic outlook on the
pace of economic recovery in our footprint. We continue to see growth in commitments and are well positioned to
increase funded loan balances as market uncertainty and liquidity subsides.
C&I line utilization declined approximately 70 basis points to 39%. A return to normalized levels of C&I line
utilization would result in over $750 million in funded balances.
The liquidity environment continues to be a headwind to consumer loan demand and resulted in declines in our
HELOC portfolio of $50 million. Our third party lending strategy is one means of responding to this liquidity and
capital environment, providing attractive risk-adjusted returns while diversifying the loan portfolio. We continue to
leverage third-party consumer lending to offset consumer loan declines, as evidenced by the $267 million
increase in third-party consumer loans for the third quarter.
In order to offset continued increase in liquidity, we grew the securities portfolio by $1 billion to 19% of total assets
at the end of the quarter. As evidenced in the appendix, a significant portion of the growth was in short-dated
securities, which mature in less than one year. We intend to continue rebuilding the third-party consumer loan
portfolio to pre-pandemic levels, as long as we secure more assets with attractive risk-adjusted returns. At the
end of the third quarter, third party held for investment balances were $1.7 billion, or 3% of total assets. Growth in
this portfolio is predicated on overall balance sheet dynamics, including capital, liquidity, and client loan growth.
As you can see on slide 5, core transaction deposits increased $1 billion, or 3% from the prior quarter. Core non-
interest bearing deposit growth of $490 million, or 3%, was offset by strategic declines in time and brokered
deposit portfolios. Total deposit costs continued to decline with a reduction of 3 basis points to 13 basis points.
This was primarily driven by deposit mix optimization and strategic reductions in high calls transactional deposits.
Time deposits declined 35% from the prior year, accounting for 5% of total deposits, compared to 9% a year ago.
This was led by the reduction in higher call CDs.
While we believe there are additional opportunities for improvement through ongoing product repricing and the
continued disciplined balance sheet management, it is likely that deposit calls remain relatively stable over the
next two quarters.
As shown on slide 6, net interest income was $385 million, an increase of $3 million from the prior quarter. The
net interest margin was stable, with a decline of 1 basis point to 3.01%. We are focused on profitable growth over
the long term, which includes further optimization of the balance sheet through strategies I just outlined on the
previous slides.
Our top priority remains multi-solution client growth; however, we believe there are further opportunities to
balance credit duration and liquidity risks. We believe that longer-term view, in conjunction with strong commercial
loan production in our high-growth Southeast footprint, can provide outsized NII increases. We reiterate our
previous guidance that NII, excluding PPP, will increase in the second half of the year. Loan growth and the
deployment of excess liquidity are expected to offset headwinds from continued fixed rate repricing and the slight
reduction in LIBOR. We expect PPP revenue to decline between $8 million and $12 million in the fourth quarter.
The net interest margin continues to be pressured by the liquidity environment. While liquidity is generally
accretive to NII, the impact of cash on the balance sheet and securities portfolio growth are likely to continue to be
a NIM headwind for the foreseeable future.

Slide 7 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $114 million, up $8 million from the previous quarter. The
increase was led by growth of $5 million in capital markets, which resulted from swap income and $2 million in
loan syndication fees. The growth in syndication fees is evidence of why we believe we have opportunities to go
upmarket and compete. Kevin will speak more to this shortly. Broad-based growth across other NIR categories
was evidenced by our performance in our treasury group, in core banking fees, and highlighted by our wealth
areas that are up more than 25% year-over-year.
In the third quarter, we had approximately $4 million in revenue associated with SBA loan sales and low-income
housing transactions. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted NIR to decline, as broad-based growth is more
than offset by the continued normalization of mortgage revenues, seasonality of our brokerage business, and third
quarter gains that are not expected to repeat.
Slide 8 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $267 million, down $1 million from the prior quarter. A $5
million reduction in third-party processing fees was offset by a $4 million increase in production incentives and
additional project spend of $2 million. We expect a similar level of adjusted non-interest expense in the fourth
quarter, with some increases in areas related to increased branch staffing expense, as well as revenue in
customer-facing projects as we invest for future top-line growth.
Key credit metrics on slide 9 remain stable near historical lows. The net charge-off ratio fell 6 basis points to
0.22%, while criticized and classified loans declined 22%. The NPA and NPL ratios were each down 1 basis point.
Past dues were flat at 0.13%, excluding the increase from PPP loans. We expect net charge-offs in the fourth
quarter to remain relatively stable, and assuming a similar trend in economic improvement, a further reduction in
the ACL ratio, which ended the quarter down 12 basis points excluding PPP loans to 1.42%. This quarter, the
baseline economic outlook improved; however, due to the economic uncertainty, our multi-scenario framework
included a 45% bias to downside scenarios.
As noted on slide 10, the CET1 ratio declined 12 basis points to 9.63% due primarily to capital deployment for
growth in our loan and securities portfolios as we continue to actively manage excess liquidity. Strong financial
performance allowed us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and common shareholder
dividends. Through the end of the third quarter, we have completed approximately $167 million of the $200 million
share repurchase authorization for the year. And we expect to repurchase the remaining $33 million in the fourth
quarter.
We will continue deploying capital to support client growth and facilitate opportunistic inorganic opportunities like
third-party consumer purchases, while returning capital to our shareholders. Our capital position remains strong,
and we are well-positioned to complete key strategic objectives focused on profitable growth, prioritizing multi-
solution client relationships.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin.

Thank you, Jamie. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points.
That same day, we unveiled details of Synovus Forward, a plan we created in 2019 that would deliver an
incremental pre-tax run rate benefit of $100 million by the end of 2021. We're excited today to share that our
efforts to date have yielded approximately $100 million in pre-tax benefits. Half of the benefit to date comes from
expenses, which were front-loaded in the plan to better fund the journey forward.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
As a reminder, the most significant items to date have come from organizational efficiencies and head count
reductions, a reduction in third-party spend, as well as branch and non-branch real estate consolidation. As a
result of these actions, as well as demand management, our adjusted expenses are down $15 million year-to-
date or 2%. Although expense reductions will become a lower percentage of the Synovus Forward benefits in
2022, we will continue to manage with discipline as we expect inflationary pressures, especially around wages,
will impact our overall expense base over the near term.
One of our ongoing initiatives is branch rationalization. We are scheduled to close an additional four branches in
the fourth quarter, bringing our total consolidation to 20 locations since January 2020. We have additional
closures planned in 2022 as we continue to see the opportunity to optimize the network and do so without having
outsized attrition. While we rank favorably in key metrics such as deposits per branch and branch proximity, we
believe our digital efforts, as well as the shifting behaviors of our clients; provide an opportunity to further
streamline our delivery through our bricks and mortar channel.
And these changes are not limited to branches. Last month, we announced a strategy to optimize our real estate
here at our headquarters by selling our own real estate and consolidating our nine corporate and retail locations in
Uptown Columbus into three, it allows us to evolve our workplace for the future of work while reducing our overall
square footage by over 60%, leading to a lower run rate expense and greater flexibility for potential future
optimization opportunities.
As we move forward, a key focus on expenses will be on optimizing how and where we invest. By delivering
ongoing efficiencies in this quickly changing landscape, we have and will continue to reallocate resources from
infrastructure to innovation and support functions to revenue producing talent. Our investments will be governed
and prioritized by the objective of maintaining long term positive operating leverage, which leads to our discussion
regarding revenue enhancement within Synovus Forward.
Much of the future benefits are predicated on the use of analytics to drive a deeper share of wallet. Enhanced
analytics are now firmly in place for our commercial line of business, and we have begun development for our
consumer LOB to complement the high-touch approach that our team members deliver today These more timely
and actionable insights promote our ability to offer more meaningful advisory capabilities and solutions and better
meet the needs of our clients.
A significant portion of the incremental revenue benefit in the third quarter relates to our profitability
enhancements, as well as our balance sheet management efforts. Similar to our pricing for value initiative within
treasury management, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we began utilizing various analytical tools and
capabilities to actively drive deposit cost lower. Of the 26-basis point decline in deposit pricing that occurred over
that timeframe, our Synovus Forward initiatives drove additional product and customer level repricing, which
represented 3 basis points of that decline, contributing $15 million in incremental pre-tax run rate benefit by the
end of the quarter.
Additional balance sheet management efforts have largely been centered around increasing the risk adjusted
yield of the loan portfolio. Targeted remixing of a subset of consumer loans throughout 2021 has translated into
relative higher yields, resulting in an incremental pre-tax run rate benefit of $16 million. We remain committed and
on track to achieve the cumulative pre-tax run rate benefit of $175 million by the end of 2022 and are confident
about the opportunities ahead to achieve those benefits.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Consistent with our reporting to date, we will provide more detail on each initiative as they are sized and realized.
Some of the future initiatives are a function of our renewed focus on innovation. I'm excited to provide more
details regarding new products and solutions later in the year as we work towards their respective rollout.
Our 2021 outlook on slide 12 remains unchanged from the prior quarter. However, I'd like to share some
additional updates on how we expect to end the year. In July, we mentioned that we expect that 2021 loan growth
excluding balance change from PPP and third party consumer loans to be at the low end of the 2% to 4%
guidance. While pay off activity remains a significant headwind, recent productions, client conversations, and our
loan pipeline leads us to expect loan growth to be in the lower half of our guidance.
Although excluded from the guidance, it's important to note that we've increased third-party consumer loans more
than $1 billion year-to-date and our total loans at the end of the third quarter were up 4% excluding changes in
PPP balances. Total adjusted revenues are expected at the higher end of the negative 1% to 1% guidance as the
balance sheet management efforts we've taken throughout the year to monetize excess liquidity and reduce the
cost of funds are being complemented by broad based fee revenue growth outside of the normalization of
mortgage revenues.
Similarly, total adjusted expenses are expected to end the year within the existing guidance of negative 1% to
negative 2% thus providing the opportunity to achieve positive operating leverage. We expect to achieve this
reduction while making the longer term investments in talent and technology that support accelerated top line
growth.
We also reiterate our capital and tax guidance, the capital guidance assumes we complete the full $200 million
share repurchase authorization this year and achieve our loan growth targets. We're also trending towards the
lower half of the effective tax rate guidance of 22% to 24%. Before opening the call for Q&A, let me first thank all
of our Synovus team members for their third quarter efforts. There are so many to mention but I do want to
acknowledge our Wholesale Banking team who generated record levels of loan production, our FMS and
Treasury and Payment Solution teams who generated 25-plus percent fee income growth versus 2020, and our
Community Bank for continuing to drive strong core deposit growth.
I also want to reiterate my excitement for our new team members we have onboarded this past quarter and for
those that are scheduled to join us in the fourth quarter. As I announced in the beginning of the call, we will be
building out a corporate and investment banking team which will allow us to move upmarket a bit into a segment
that I believe we have the capabilities and talent to win in. The team will be built around specific industry
specialties to allow for customized and expert advice, and providing credit and depositary products, as well as
traditional capital market solutions. We'll share more about the progress in this area as well as other build-outs
including our restaurant services division and our expanded Florida commercial strategy over the coming
quarters.
Lastly, I'm pleased to share that we will be hosting an Investor Day in early February 2022, our first in many
years. During this event, we'll provide clear, long-term guidance with supporting information from our various
business units to show where we're focused on in driving profitable growth. You'll hear from more of our
leadership team and I believe you'll share the confidence that I have that we will be successfully delivering on our
key strategic and financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our operator for the Q&A portion.

Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good Morning. Kevin, just – you guys had a nice quarter of loan growth. I'm just curious if you could just add a
little bit of color to kind of the nature of the C&I growth, is it coming from your existing customers or are you going
– you start to see success with some of your maybe at market, upmarket type lending that you're looking to do.
Just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of where some of the growth is coming from.
And I know you commented, it seems like you're still conservative with your guidance at least through the end of
the year. But just kind of curious are you encouraged that you can kind of get back to that sort of mid-single-digit
type rate that you've talked about over the longer term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, yeah, Brad. Thank you for the question, and look, yeah, we're really excited about what the third quarter was
able to prove out from a from a growth standpoint. We – at the top of the house, the $923 million worth of growth,
ex PPP is about 10% annualized.
But to your point, if you back out the third party, we still grew our, what we would call kind of our core loan $660
million or 8% annualized. Big piece of that, as you mentioned, came from C&I, it was roughly $600 million worth of
growth or 14% annualized. And it was really across a bunch of different areas, not only – you mentioned
upmarket, there was growth in specialty lending, but there was also growth in our – our core middle market
franchise.
We also saw a tremendous amount of diversified growth across some of the NAICS codes. We had five NAICS
codes that had over $50 million worth of growth including finance and insurance, healthcare, accommodations
and food services, construction and manufacturing. So, it was really, really broad-based.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
When you look at the total production, total production was up about 50% versus where it was last quarter in just
C&I. At the same time, we also saw growth in CRE. We saw 90% increase in production quarter-over-quarter
there. So as we shared at the beginning of the year, we really felt like commercial was going to be the place we
had the right to win, and where we would grow, and we think the third quarter proved that out.
In terms of being able to maintain that mid-single digit long term, yeah, we've always felt like we will be able to
produce a level of growth that exceeds that of our state GDP's. The question mark that we've had and it continued
this quarter, we were just able to overcome it; when you look at the level of payoffs that we had, at $2.1 billion in
Commercial that was about $700 million higher than the nine-quarter average.
So, when you look at what's happening from our client's perspective, we have a lot of customers who were taking
chips off the table because of the perspective change and capital gains, as well as cap rates on the CRE side
being very, very low.
So, we believe that we'll be able to continue the momentum on the production side. We think some of these new
businesses that we're bringing on board will provide some tailwinds on that with the real headwinds being the
payoffs that we saw this quarter, and we would expect to see those elevated again in the fourth quarter as we
close out 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. And as my follow-up, Jamie, I was curious if you could comment on kind of the impact of GreenSky
selling to Goldman on Synovus. I know a little over a year ago, you changed that relationship to where it was less
of a balance sheet product for you guys and more one that impact fee income. But just kind of curious what it
means for the P&L going forward presumably if that relationship with Synovus no longer exists.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brad, I mean, it's a great question. You're well aware that our relationship with GreenSky goes back a long
ways and it's been a great partnership between organizations. But also, you're aware that our third-party portfolio
has evolved over time as we look for the right assets that fit our strategic priorities. Within Greensky, you've seen
the relationship evolve from the HFI strategy to a HFS strategy that actually uniquely helped both companies. And
so, the relationship has been very close. We're pleased with how we've worked together so we can both achieve
our strategic objectives and priorities.
And we're in conversations with GreenSky as we navigate through their changes and we're comfortable we will
find an amicable solution. I would say it's too early to think about what the future state may look like because it's
just uncertain at the moment. But we're in conversation with them and we feel good about where we are.

Thanks, EB.
<<Q – [06VKGB-E]EB Poonawala – Bank of America Merrill Lynch>: Just maybe to start out at the very last point
in terms of the build out of the – I think restaurant finance and you mentioned the corporate investment bank. How
meaningful are those build-outs going to be as we think about operating leverage over the next few quarters?
You've been in that 54%, 55% adjusted efficiency. I'm just wondering, are we on track where over the next –
course of the next year or two we are moving into the low-50s. Give us a sense of just maybe the cadence of
what that investment spend around building out those businesses likely to look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
EB, it's a really good question because as we've said in previous quarters, our focus is getting back to a long-term
positive operating leverage environment, and for us that's going to be the calibration for how we evaluate, how
much money we're willing to spend on certain investments. And so, when we look at the corporate and investment
banking unit or some of the other build-outs like the restaurant services division or new talent in Florida, we're
going to make sure that when we make those investments, number one, that they have a solid earn-back, that we
look at what that business or product unit would bring to the P&L, and we want to make sure that it's a relatively
short payback period.
Two, as we build out some of these units and we'll share that with you, we believe that we'll be able to continue to
invest while finding efficiencies in other areas that will allow us to maintain that positive operating leverage. So I
wouldn't want you to think that we're going to go out and build out these new businesses, and it's going to be a
side note as it relates to our overarching goals on the efficiency front.
Now, we're not in a position today to give you our 2022 or 2023 efficiency targets, but based on the goal of
maintaining positive operating leverage, you should assume that our goal is to continue to push that efficiency

ratio lower despite some of these investments. And the way that we're laddering many of these investments,
many will start to produce, and that will allow us to start to fund new initiatives and build out the teams at an even
greater scale over time. But, to us, it needs to be synergistic to where we're not only growing the bank but it's
helping to fund future growth.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. That's helpful. And just, I guess, maybe Jamie, the third-party partnerships, you mentioned it's about 3% of
assets. Remind us how you're thinking about how large it can get, what it was previously when you had both
those third-party relationships pre-pandemic. And just as a follow-up on GreenSky, is the only impact, let's say, if
that relationship were to be terminated, tied to the held-for-sale balances, or are there additional P&L impacts that
we should be thinking about? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim. On the third party, we are very comfortable with that portfolio being at the same level that it was
pre-pandemic. And so if you looked at the percentage of loans, we showed percentage of assets in our
presentation today, but if you look at the percentage of loans, it peaked around 6%. In the third quarter of 2019, it
was 5%. We were comfortable in that area. And there's no magic to the size of that portfolio. We feel that we are
very capable in managing that portfolio. We believe in our partnerships. We have long relationships with all of
them and feel good about where we are and our knowledge of those loans. And so, we're very comfortable with
that portfolio.
Recently, you've seen us diversify the risks embedded in that portfolio by looking at collateralized loans, as well
as shorter duration loans. And so we feel good about the opportunities we're finding there. And it is our intent to
continue growing that portfolio as we move forward, but we will only do so if the right risk-adjusted returns are
there.
With regards to GreenSky and the future evolution of that portfolio, I would just say that the two significant
components of that are the HFS strategy and the HFI strategy. But it's too early to comment around the potential
financial impact in the various scenarios that could play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
But Ebrahim, I would just add, yeah, I just want to make sure you had – our held for investment there is now less
than $250 million. So it's a relatively small balance on our outstanding loans on the held for investment side. So it
has been continuing to diminish over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Kevin, wondering if you could expand on your comments on going upmarket, just kind of talk about what kind of
loan sizes you're now willing to do versus previously. And if you could talk a little bit about restaurant services and
what that team will do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Jennifer, as it relates to going upmarket, outside of the expansion into this corporate investment banking
capabilities, our wholesale bank has already built out a syndicated finance arm. This quarter, we had a very large
lead arranger fee, $1.6 million on a transaction that we led. And so, we believe today, we already have the
capabilities to go upmarket and originate larger loans over $100 million and sell down those loans, so that would
continue under this corporate and investment banking model.
We do want to make sure that as we build this out, we're not going to build a generalized model. We're going to
go after industry specialty in the corporate investment banking space, and that will be predicated based on what's
available in the marketplace from a talent standpoint. But also we'll align that with those areas that we think we're
particularly strong in the Southeast and with our existing banking franchise to make sure that we leverage that.
In terms of hold limits, we really haven't changed our hold limits. That will stay the same. We generally do not
keep credits larger than $100 million, and that would not change there. Our total hold levels would not change. It's
really just we'll go upmarket for larger customers but be able to sell some of those down.
On the restaurant services business, it was really attracting the team from a superregional bank that has been
covering franchise and restaurant businesses nationally. It would be full service, QSR, and the like. We've proven
out with things like specialty finance, senior housing, where when we bring in very skilled bankers that have
industry expertise, we're able to grow that business, and we think we've been able to do that with the traction of
this team that will focus on restaurant services.

Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back to the revenue guide, if I just
take the high end, it implies about a $21 million decline from the third quarter revenues to get to the adjusted full-
year guidance. And I understand about $10 million of that's going to be declining PPP fees given the $8 million to
$12 million step-down. Can you just kind of speak to that and what the puts and takes are? It just seems
conservative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, yeah, Michael, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. As we look at the revenue guide and outlook for the fourth
quarter, you're right, there are some revenues that happen in the third quarter that will not likely recur in the fourth
quarter. Paycheck Protection Program being the first as you mentioned, we expect that to decline somewhere
between $8 million to $12 million in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that's highly uncertain.
But on the fee revenue side, NIR was very strong in the third quarter and we saw the same broad-based growth
that we've been talking about for quarters and it's a really good story. However, there are a few things that
happened in the third quarter that are not likely to recur in the fourth quarter, and those include some sales of
affordable housing, SBA sales. And then, there'll also be some seasonal impacts in trust brokerage and mortgage
that could be quarter-on-quarter headwinds.
So, we feel good about our overall revenue guidance for 2021. We expect to land at the higher end of that range.
And we think that we're positioned well heading into 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just going to the margin; if I exclude PPP fees, it looks like the core margin
was down somewhere close to 8 basis points this quarter. Do you think we're getting to a point where the NIM is
going to start to stabilize particularly as loan growth picks up, and the rest of the PPP is forgiven just as we move
forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we look at the margin, I mean, there are obvious headwinds as we move forward just to the headline
margin. I know you excluded PPP, which we do as well, but that decline in PPP fee recognition in the fourth
quarter will impact the headline margin fairly significantly in the fourth quarter. But when you exclude the
Paycheck Protection Program, you have a couple crosscurrents. So first is current rates are a slight headwind to
both NII and the margin given current short-term and long-term rates. But the liquidity environment is a notable
NIM headwind that we're working against as we try to deploy our liquidity in our balance sheet.
Our outlook for the margin in general remains in the same context we discussed last quarter with a medium term
margin in the 3% area. But we had highlighted that the NIM outlook is very dependent on that future deposit
growth. That deposit growth, that incremental liquidity is generally accretive to NII, but that increased cash on the
balance sheet or even if we deploy it to the securities portfolio is non-dilutive. So we feel good about our core NII
14

outlook. We believe it points to steady growth as liquidity is deployed in the client loans, third party and securities
that should off more than offset the rate headwinds at current levels. But we do acknowledge that the liquidity
environment can impact the margin pretty significantly.

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. My first question on loan growth. On slide 4, you show that
commercial loan payoffs were about $2 billion in the third quarter. Give a sense of how much of these payoffs are
refinancing and staying with Synovus in the funded production bucket as opposed to the funded bucket
representing brand new loans to the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Tony, none of those would have been refinanced out. So those are total payoffs so they would have exited the
balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So the blue bar of little more than $2 billion represent entirely new production to the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's right. Those are new loans, new originations, funded loans, and then on the other bar that represents
payoffs. And as I said earlier, that $2.1 billion in commercial payoffs, it was over the last nine quarters that
averaged only about $1.4 billion. So we've seen elevation there, but when you look at the production side, that
$2.5 billion worth of funded production, new loans is actually up 70% versus the previous quarter. So despite the
fact that we did see elevated payoffs, we were able to overcome that by seeing a much higher increase in
production.

Okay, great. And then my follow-up, so you got the loan growth outlook unchanged at the low-end or the low half
of 2% to 4% ex PPP and ex third party consumer, which if I just do the math, it would imply a little bit of a
slowdown in terms of dollars of growth in the fourth quarter. Anything particular you're seeing that could lead to
loan growth decelerating or is this just a little bit of conservatism baked in here? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Tony, it's a – it's a good question. It's like; we're looking at a crystal ball and trying to look at all the elements. Our
pipelines remain robust. They're still up 20% over where they were entering the year. They're down a little bit from
the – from the beginning of the third quarter just because we had such strong production.
So we're very confident in the production side of the equation. What's – the challenge is on these payoffs. As we
close out 2021, knowing that there's a potential for a change in tax treatment, we're cognizant that there could be
elevated activity this quarter that would result in even higher pay off activity.
Now, we don't have anything at this point that would show that that's the case, but we want to make sure that as
we look into the fourth quarter, we evaluate that as a potential. So that's – our guidance last quarter was that we
would be at the low-end of the range. We suddenly said in our guidance this quarter that we would be above the
low-end of the range so we could move more towards the median, but it really will be function of what that pay off
activity is, not our productivity.

So, just a question on your margin. I guess your interest rate sensitivity table from last quarter, there's a gradual
parallel 100-basis point rise in rates. Your NII goes up by 3.2%. Can you share with us the deposit beta
assumptions that you put into that in terms of whether they were fully loaded on the first rate hike or if they were
graduated up through that fourth quarter period?

Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we think about deposit betas in this environment, we expect that deposit betas will be very low, fairly de
minimis for the first few rate hikes. Beyond that, we would expect to see something in the area of about a 40%
beta as rates go higher from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, is that in your interest rate sensitivity on the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, just my follow-up is just on your expenses, you guys are doing a great job managing the
expenses. Are you seeing any signs of wage pressure popping up as you try to manage these expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Steve, that's a new headwind. Obviously, everybody sees what's happening with the labor force and potential
inflation around wages. We're seeing that as well. Predominantly, in our entry level positions in those folks that
make below the median wage here at Synovus, which is right around $60,000, we did in the third quarter make an
adjustment to all of those individuals to give a cost of living adjustment just based on that. But I think as we're
looking at hiring in new talent, we see the cost rising across the board. And I think that's just something that
whether it's the financial services industry or any other industry. I think it's just part of the equation. And it's part of
what makes it important to build a place that people want to work. When you look at our attrition this year
annualized, we're still at about 23% in total attrition. If you compare that back to 2019, we were roughly at 19%.
So, although we've seen an increase in attrition, it's not at the levels that some of our peers are experiencing from
some of the benchmarks I've seen.
So, I think for us, part of it is going to be to compete from a wage standpoint. But as we all know, there's more to a
job than just what you earn and so we're trying to make sure that we drive better levels of engagement through
development, career development to make sure that we're offering perks outside of wages. But ultimately, we
agree that you're going to see some inflationary pressure on wages as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. I appreciate that. And right now it's just occurring at the entry level. It hasn't permeated much further up, is
that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think it's more pronounced at the entry level just because you have higher turnover there. So you're seeing the
new wages come on. What's changing I think for all companies is the ability to work remote has widened people's

sandbox so that they can get a job working in New York out of Atlanta, Georgia or Columbus, Georgia. And so
that in and of itself increases potential the cost of employment just because there's new entrants into the
marketplace to be able to compete for that talent. So, I think you're going to see it across the spectrum where
we've seen it today just because of a higher level of attrition has been on those entry level positions.

Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey Jamie. Just on the expense guidance. You gave color around the revenue guide that you expect to be
towards the higher end of the guidance. On the expenses, you all are trending towards the better end of that
guidance year-to-date. And so, as I think about the fourth quarter run rate, just given some of the fee income
items that might not reoccur and maybe it's another slower mortgage quarter, is there any reason to think that
expenses should inflect higher in the fourth quarter or should we continue on sort of a downward trajectory here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We believe that expenses in the fourth quarter will likely be relatively stable to the third quarter. There are
some typical inflationary pressures on NIE, but we also have – and we also have incremental spend for growth.
And so, we have those. We have some tailwinds that come through on some of our Synovus Forward initiatives.
18

stable to the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up is a little bit of a multi-part question here just around liquidity deployment.
You guys put a decent chunk of liquidity to work. And so, I guess I wanted to ask two questions as it relates to the
securities portfolio. One, it looked like that was maybe weighted towards the back half of the quarter, kind of
comparing the average balance in the period end a little bit, one, is that the case. And then two, the security yield
stabilized and so, what's the kind of incremental yield that you're putting on the book currently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good question then and you're right, generally about the timing, and going on yields are really, really in the
context of portfolio yields. So our book yield on the portfolio in the third quarter was 1.45%. Our going on yields
are on a similar context between 1.40% and 1.50%. But you can also see that we – our strategy in the securities
portfolio evolved a little bit in the third quarter and we have about $650 million of investments that are maturities
less than one year. And so we're trying to – kind of opportunist – opportunistically deploy that liquidity in the
securities book in areas that don't have as much duration risk as a conventional mortgage. And so, that's one of
the strategies that we're currently deploying.

The baseball analogy, Chris, is hard because I think, unfortunately, this is a game that doesn't play in a nine-
inning framework. I think it's something that this game goes on forever. It may be one of the ones where that's a
timeless game, kind of like maybe some of these cricket games that go on for days, but the reality is, we made
great progress. We focused on starting with our consumer platform, My Synovus, to enhance that several years
ago, we rolled it out, and if you look at the Apple Store rating today on our app, it's 4.8, which is one of the highest
in the industry, and I think that's a testament to our digital team and our consumer team working to make sure that
the functionality and capabilities we have within that platform meets the needs of our customers, and it's agile and
pliable so we can continue to add new functionality over time.
And I think you see that with our digital enrollment, adding Zelle to the functionality last year, moving more people
to paperless, all of the things that you want to see in the digital platform. Our focus on the consumer side really is
about taking the online account origination to the next level. We've been very successful in the mortgage front,
originating more than 70% of our mortgages via our digital application. We're seeing more traction on the
depository side, and now we're working more towards the consumer lending platform.
So, I would tell you that if you're looking at the area we're most focused on, it's the online account origination,
enhancing that capability, and making it even easier and faster for our customers to apply for our products. On the
commercial side, we're excited about the Synovus Gateway platform. As we've shared, we've migrated about
90% of our customers over to the platform. We have one additional wave in the first quarter of next year. And we
think that platform in and of itself is going to create a better user experience, and it's going to allow us to continue
to add new products and functionality that our customers not only need but will allow them to reduce their back
office expense. We'll be able to automate many of the functions that they're doing. So, we're excited about that.
As I think you look in the future on commercial, it's more about products and solutions and making sure that we
continue to add there. So, digital for us will continue to be a part of our ongoing roadmap. I think you'll start to
switch from service into more of a sales capability. We noted on the prepared remarks that adding insights both
on our commercial side, which we've already done, we're moving towards that insight-driven model on the
consumer side that will allow our bankers to offer advice more frequently and will allow the technology to queue
up our customers for exciting offers or opportunities to improve their financial well-being. So, there's a lot of work
to go here, but I think we feel like we have the right focus and we have the right resources that will continue to
drive ongoing investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No, that's great. I appreciate all the background there. And I guess, in addition to the positive operating leverage
that you and Jamie both talked about this morning, is it fair that the per transaction cost for Synovus is going to be
a lot different in future years than what we've seen in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Absolutely. I mean, we talk about internally radically automating our platforms to make it – not only to cut the
cycle times, but to reduce the expense. In addition, when you think about the cost associated with our bricks and
mortar, we'll continue to consolidate that network and have the opportunity to reduce that cost of operations, and
ultimately then reduce our cost to serve. But that has to be a key component of positive operating leverage. You
won't do it just from asset sensitivity. You won't do it through balance augmentation. You're going to have to do it
by growing your business, which is a keen focus of ours, but at the same time cutting your cost to serve.

I wanted to start with the reserve. You came into this year with a reserve of a little over 180 basis points, and as
credit has improved and fears of COVID have gone away, it's now down about 140 basis points. Assuming credit
continues to hold in and get better from here, how much further down do you think that reserve can release to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. As you look at our credit metrics, you can see that we're not seeing credit deterioration
in our loan portfolio. So we feel really good about where we are and what we have line of sight into on the credit
side is strong. And when you look at the employment outlook overall for next year, for 2022, our base outlook
continues to improve. However, we do believe that the uncertainty in the economic outlook remains elevated, and
we quantify that as a higher weighting to downside scenarios. We have that at 45% this quarter, and that impacts
the allowance.
And so, when you look at just the base case scenario, over the past few quarters, we've seen a sequential
improvement in life of loan losses in that scenario. However, we do use a multi-scenario framework. And
downside scenarios kind of – they remain as severe as they were in the past. And so, that weighting impacts the
rate of improvement of your allowance to loan ratio. So, that's kind of what's been driving the decline and why the
decline is maybe different than what you're seeing elsewhere. But we do believe that our day 1 allowance is
indicative of where we should return in a more normalized economic outlook, assuming that the loan mix remains
the same.

And so, we are seeing loan mix evolve, and that could result in even better than day 1 allowance to loan ratio. But
those are the main puts and takes. I mean, there's nothing that we see today that's concerning to us on the credit
side. Our base case scenario continues to show improvement, and we – if we can reduce the uncertainty in the
outlook, we believe that that'll drive further allowance to loan ratio improvement.

Okay. And then my follow-up, I wanted to ask just about share buybacks, not necessarily for the fourth quarter. I
think we know what you guys are going to do there. But as you look longer term, in the past several years, you
guys have been pretty active in the buyback. But growth feels like it's inflecting for the industry. It sure looks like
it's inflecting for you all in the third quarter with the uptick. When you look longer term, as growth kicks in, does the
buyback take a backseat to that? And should we expect a lesser amount of buybacks longer term, just with you
guys focusing more on deploying that capital to growth, which I know is your preference?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, you're – you're exactly right on that being the preference and our strategic priority. I feel like, over the course
of 2021, we've all been scanning the horizon with our binoculars looking for growth in the third quarter. We feel
good about how the team performed and what we delivered. And so that's our priority and that's our target for
deploying that excess capital generated through earnings. But when we look at longer term, we will continue to
target kind of the 30% to 40% dividend payout ratio. And then beyond that, it really is balanced between risk
adjusted returns on growth, on core client growth, as well as third party and share repurchases. And so, our intent
is to deploy as much of that capital as possible to our clients. And so, we'll see if this momentum continues, we
believe it will, but that's our intent for today.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2021
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you and thanks, everyone, for your attendance today and for your ongoing interest in Synovus. As I close, I
do want to congratulate once again, our Head of Treasury & Payment Solutions, Katherine Weislogel; and our
Chief Strategy & Customer Experience Officer, Liz Wolverton; for their recognition among American Bankers'
2021 Most Powerful Woman in Banking to Watch. It's hard to believe, it's been nearly 130 days since I've taken
the CEO role. It's been an extremely smooth transition. And Kessel and I continued to talk regularly as he actively
serves in his new capacity as Executive Chairman.
I want to thank our entire team for fresh perspectives, for a constructive challenges to new ideas and
opportunities, for embracing change and for the excitement about our bright future. Like many of our peers, we're
continuing to monitor COVID trends and preparing for the next phase of the future of work. Despite those
continued challenges, our team has been unwavering in their ability to serve clients, connecting new
relationships, and growth opportunities in finding ways to care for each other and our communities.
Based on our result this quarter as well as the overall customer sentiment, we remain very optimistic that we'll
continue to see a constructive economic environment as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2022. And this
will continue to serve as our platform for our focus on growth. In the meantime, our team is heads down, keenly
focused on making the right strategic investments in both our core foundational elements or areas, and
understanding that we must make room for transformational opportunities that make us more competitive, more
efficient and valuable to our clients, prospects, and our stakeholders.
We look forward to these future opportunities and I continue to tell our story and deliver on our commitments. But
if you allow me, I wanted to end today's call with one of the guiding principles that Jonathan Rosen created for his
Global One business, as I believe it's a fitting way to conclude our call and also to recognize him for his many
contributions. All of his principles were established and they were very concise but powerful. This principle I chose
today was number 9 out of 10, and it was titled With Purpose, and it went, think strategically, act tactically, what
we do each day must advance our strategy. If not, we are just a day older. So, Jonathan, my friend, thank you for
that sage advice. We will not let each day go by and realize we are just a day older. We will advance our strategy.
And with that operator, we'll close out the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now
disconnect.
