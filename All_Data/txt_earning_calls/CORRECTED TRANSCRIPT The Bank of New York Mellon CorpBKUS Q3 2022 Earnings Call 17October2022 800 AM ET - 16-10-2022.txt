Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Marius, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Having formally taken over as CEO a
little over a month ago, it is a tremendous honor to usher in a new chapter with this great institution. After
spending a significant portion of the past few months engaging with clients, regulators, employees and other
business leaders, I'm excited about our exceptional client franchise, our central role in global financial markets
and the opportunity that lies ahead.
Now as a new CEO and considering the current environment, and it being the time of year when budgets and
strategic plans are helpfully debated and brought together. Naturally, I'm using this opportunity to take a
particularly close look at our priorities.
While I'm still reviewing everything, it's apparent to me that while we've made good progress in a number of areas
over the last couple of years, there are also clearly opportunities to further enhance BNY Mellon's performance for
our clients and shareholders alike.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
First, I see exciting growth opportunities and numerous examples of innovation like Pershing X, the reimagining of
our collateral and custody platforms, digital assets and real-time payments that we need to continue to invest in
and execute on with great discipline and urgency.
Second, we're not just reviewing the top line. We are also closely examining our cost base and margins. I'm
questioning how we do things and I'm of the view that our margins should be better in some areas. For example,
we talked to you about improving our pre-tax margin in Securities Services to 30% over the medium term. More
broadly, we are also going to be looking for efficiency opportunities as we drive our operating model
transformation and will be very determined to see them through.
And third, while we have been providing more holistic solutions to clients that we believe our unique collection of
businesses is better placed to deliver. We have the potential to do a lot more. I touched on this on the last
earnings call, but I continue to believe that the opportunity to deliver the whole firm through a more unified 1BNY
Mellon is meaningful. As we continue to work through and bottom out all of these opportunities in the coming
months, we will be regularly providing you with progress updates along the way.
Moving on to the quarter, I'll start with some broader perspectives, before I run through a few financial highlights,
and then I'll turn it over to Emily to review our financial results in more detail. As you're aware, during the quarter,
we continue to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets, persistently high
inflation, driving increased expectations for significant rapid rate increases by central banks in developed
countries, a strengthening US dollar and a complex geopolitical landscape.
We also began to see some government intervention, for example, Japan stepping into the FX market to manage
their currency. And this was particularly on display in the UK, wherein the last few weeks, there has been
extraordinary volatility in the gilt market, as a result of the UK government's spending and taxation plans. This led
to a series of actions by the Bank of England, including delaying their QT plans, announcing a gilt purchase
program and a liquidity facility, aimed to stabilize the market.
Our business model as a core provider touching so much of the financial system, gives us a terrific vantage point
on what's going on in markets. For example, our data shows that building up throughout the quarter and heading
into quarter end, the market was extremely short euros to levels not seen in quite a few years. And we've seen
international holders selling US treasuries. And more broadly, it's clear that market liquidity continues to be
challenged in some markets more so than in others.
As we sit here today, most markets have continued to function in a relatively orderly fashion, trades are settling
and faileds and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels. But clearly, risks are elevated and the system feels more
fragile than it was a few months ago. While the environment is quite uncertain, our platform of trust and innovation
is very much in demand by our clients. As their cost pressures rise, we are seeing a lot of interest in engaging
with us to review operating models. The scale of our platforms should allow us to lower operating costs for our
clients, enabling them to focus on their core strengths.
Turning to our performance in the quarter and referring to page 2 of our financial highlights presentation. We
reported EPS of $0.39 on $4.3 billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of 7%. These results
were impacted by a goodwill impairment charge that Emily will discuss in more detail shortly.
Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21, up 11% year-over-year, and our return on tangible
common equity was 22%. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year, a testament to the diversity and resiliency of our

business model. This performance reflected the benefit of higher interest rates, as well as continued strength in
client volumes and balances across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments.
While Investment and Wealth Management was naturally more affected by the continued decline in global market
values, particularly in Investment Management, the business delivered positive net inflows in the quarter and
continued to deliver solid investment performance for our clients.
Touching on a few business highlights, Asset Servicing continued to deliver solid top line results and our sales
momentum remains strong with wins and mandates up from a strong 2021, and yet to be installed AUC/A
meaningfully higher than last quarter.
In ETFs, we continue to see strong net inflows and the total number of fund service is up almost 10% from the
beginning of the year. We're also seeing strong momentum and traction in the alts space and have an active
pipeline across credit, private equity and real estate.
And we were pleased to announce that Aviva Investors, a large European-based global asset manager, recently
appointed us to provide a fully integrated operating model for certain front office support services, as well as
middle and back office activities, allowing them to focus on delivering an exceptional client experience powered in
no small part by the scale and capabilities of our platform.
And finally, following the formation of our Digital Assets Unit in 2021, we are now live with our digital asset
custody platform in the US. To this point, we continue to see significant institutional demand for resilient, scalable
financial infrastructure built to accommodate both traditional and digital assets, and we see digital asset custody
as an important foundational capability for the future of financial markets as blockchain technology allows for
tokenization of all kinds of assets and currencies.
But just to be clear, we did not invest in this space just for the purpose of custody in crypto, we see this as the
beginning of a much broader journey.
Pershing had a solid and resilient quarter, benefiting from its diverse revenue mix that includes not only market-
based fees, but also transaction fees, balance-based fees, subscription fees and net interest revenue with many
of these income streams playing well in the current environment.
We also gathered a strong $45 billion of net new assets in the quarter and the pipeline remains healthy, boding
well for flows in the months ahead.
Pershing X reached another milestone through an equity investment and partnership with Conquest Planning, a
fintech which uses AI and powerful analytics tools to help advisors improve their efficiency and create highly
customizable financial plans for their clients. X's minimum viable product remains on track to launch in the fourth
quarter.
Our client engagement, together with the product design input which that brings, is helping us to accelerate and
enhance the delivery of an exciting end-to-end digital experience for advisors.
Clearance and collateral management delivered strong growth on the back of higher US clearance volumes as
market volatility continues to drive secondary trading activity in US treasuries.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
In fact, in September, settlement volumes were the highest they've been since March of 2020. We also saw
growth in margin related services, reflecting the industry leading work that the team is doing to help our clients
comply with uncleared margin rules in derivatives trading.
Treasury Services achieved a number of wins this quarter as we continue to bring innovative new solutions to the
market. We were awarded a contract for white labeled trade processing for a major US bank. We sponsored our
first supply chain financing program for a major investment-grade corporate client and we were awarded and will
be managing payroll and digital asset transfers for a major digital asset client.
Recognizing our momentum in this business, The Banker named us 2022 Global Transaction Bank of the Year.
We're also proud to have been recognized by them with additional awards for our work to transform the real-time
and digital payment space and optimize trade finance payments by leveraging emerging technologies.
Let me conclude with a note of humility about the uncertainty that we're all witnessing in markets these days.
None of us can predict the exact path of markets and the economic conditions from here and the level of
uncertainty is greater than many have become used to.
As a firm, we are positioning ourselves conservatively in this environment, and recognize that the strength and
stability of our platform is important for the uninterrupted functioning of a significant part of global capital markets.
We're proud of this role and the service that we deliver to our clients around the world.
With that, I'll hand it over to Emily for the more detailed review of our financial performance in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.
Starting on page 3. Total revenues increased by 6% to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. Fee revenue was down 1%
as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and organic growth across our Securities Services and Market
and Wealth Services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values across equity and fixed income
markets and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar.
Firm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $42.2 trillion decreased by 7%. The impact of lower
market values and currency headwinds was tempered by continued growth from new and existing clients. And
assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 23%, also reflecting lower market values and the
unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar, partially offset by cumulative net inflows.
Investment and other revenue was $117 million in the quarter. This included a $37 million gain on the sale of our
HedgeMark subsidiary. Through our minority equity stake in the combined company, we will continue participating
in their growth and our clients will certainly benefit from a robust suite of managed account solutions.
Net interest revenue increased by 44%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates.
Reported expenses were up 26%. This included a $680 million impairment of goodwill associated with our
investment management reporting units, which was driven by lower market values and a higher discount rate.
While having impacted our earnings for the quarter, this impairment represented a non-cash charge and did not
6

(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
affect the firm's liquidity position, tangible common equity or regulatory capital ratios. Excluding notable items,
expenses were up 4%.
Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30 million, primarily reflecting reserve releases related to cash
balances and exposure to Russia as well as a modest benefit from our commercial real estate portfolio.
Our effective tax rate was 38.4% or 19.5%, excluding notable items. Reported EPS was $0.39, pre-tax margin
was 15% and return on tangible common equity was 7%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.21,
pre-tax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 22%.
Now on to capital and liquidity on page 4. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4%, up 19 basis points
sequentially, reflecting the benefit of lower average assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in Tier 1
capital. The sharp increase in interest rates, especially in the last two weeks of the quarter, resulted in an
increase of the unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities portfolio of approximately $900 million after tax
during the quarter. And we distributed approximately $300 million of earnings to our shareholders through
common stock dividends.
As I mentioned earlier, the goodwill impairment did not affect our regulatory capital ratios. Our CET1 ratio was flat
sequentially at 10%. And finally, our LCR was 116%, up 5 percentage points sequentially.
Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page 5, which I'll also talk about in sequential
terms. Net interest revenue of $926 million was up 12% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher
interest rates on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding expense.
Average deposit balances decreased 7%. The strengthening of the US dollar contributed approximately one
percentage point to this decline. Overall, this is largely consistent with our previously expressed expectation for
the trajectory of deposit balances through the remainder of the year, amid continuously rising interest rates as
well as typical seasonal declines in deposit balances in the third quarter, while non-interest bearing deposit
balances continue to hold up better than we had previously expected.
Average interest earning assets decreased by 5%. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo declined by 10%, loan
balances decreased by 1%, and our securities portfolio balances were down 2%.
Moving on to expenses on page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.7 billion on a reported basis. Excluding
notable items, expenses of $3 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year. This year-
over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency saves, higher revenue related expenses, including higher
distribution expenses related to the abatement of fee waivers, as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by
the benefit of the stronger US dollar.
A few additional details regarding noteworthy year-over-year expense variances. Distribution and servicing
expense was up 16%, driven by higher distribution costs associated with money market funds. Business
development expenses increased as travel and entertainment expense continued to normalize off a low base last
year. And lastly, the change in other expenses reflects litigation expenses in the prior year.
Turning to page 7 for a closer look at our business segments. Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1
billion, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue was up 1% and net interest revenue
increased by 54%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
As I discuss the performance of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my
comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement.
In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 3%, as growth from abating money market fee waivers,
higher client activity and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and the
strengthening of the US dollar.
We continue seeing healthy organic growth from both new and existing clients, and our sales momentum
continues with wins year-to-date up meaningfully compared to an already strong 2021.
In Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 2%, primarily reflecting the reduction of money market fee
waivers, partially offset by previously disclosed lost business in Corporate Trust in the prior year and lower fees
from depository receipts programs for Russian issuers.
Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 8. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion,
up 17% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 11% and net interest revenue was up 34%, reflecting
higher interest rates and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
In Pershing, investment services fees were up 16%. The positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and
higher client activity was partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business in the second half of
last year and lower market levels.
Net new assets were $45 billion in the quarter. On an annualized basis, this translates into a 9% growth rate,
highlighting a strong quarter of inflows for both new and existing clients, especially in this current environment.
And average active clearing accounts increased by 3% year-on-year.
In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 3%, driven by lower money market fee waivers, new
business and slightly higher payment volumes, partially offset by higher earnings credits for our clients on the
back of higher interest rates.
And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 5%, primarily reflecting higher
US government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for US treasury securities due to elevated
volatility, amid a rapidly evolving monetary policy backdrop.
Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported
total revenue of $862 million, down 16%. Fee revenue was also down 16% and net interest revenue was up 21%,
reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances.
As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased 23% year-on-year. The decrease
primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar, as about 40% of our
AUM are denominated in foreign currencies, partially offset by cumulative net inflows.
As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $23 billion of net inflows into long-term products and $2 billion of net
outflows from cash.
In Investment Management, revenue was down 20%, primarily reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable
impact of the stronger US dollar, as well as changes in the AUM mix, partially offset by lower fee waivers.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
Robin mentioned the extraordinary volatility in the UK government bond market earlier. This has caused some
significant challenges for UK pension schemes over the past few weeks. As a manager of liability-driven
investment strategies, Insight has been working closely with our clients to maintain the appropriate hedging levels
in their portfolios. And I'd like to note that as an agent between our LDI clients and their market counterparties, we
have no balance sheet exposure.
In Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% as the decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values
was partially offset by higher net interest revenue, reflecting higher interest rates. Client assets of $256 billion
were down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market values.
Page 10 shows the results of the other segments.
As always, I'd like to close with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the year as we see it today,
acknowledging the heightened uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment and continued market volatility.
Based on current market implied interest rates, we now expect net interest revenue for the full year to be up
approximately 30% compared to 2021, as we expect another quarter of sequential NIR growth.
Given the continued decline in equity and fixed income markets, as well as the continued strengthening of the US
dollar, we now expect fee revenue for the full year to be down slightly compared to 2021, assuming equity and
fixed income values as well as currencies stay at the levels where they ended the third quarter.
We continue to expect expenses, excluding notable items, for the full year to be within the range of up 5% to 5.5%
that we had guided you throughout the year. That being said, we are intensely focused on disciplined expense
management and are working hard to drive this towards the bottom half of that range. And we still expect an
effective tax rate between 19.5% and 20% in the fourth quarter.
And finally, I'll note that we continue to manage to a Tier 1 leverage ratio target of 5.5% as well as a CET1 ratio
target of 10%. As we think about the right timing for a resumption of buybacks in the coming months, we will
continue to be prudent and consider capital levels, the expected trajectory of deposit balances and AOCI, as well
as the economic outlook at that time.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, we ask you that you please limit yourself to one
question and one related follow-up question. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from
Evercore. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. So I appreciate your comments about acting as agent in the LDI cases in the UK. I wonder if we
could get a little more of the ins and outs, the impact to both BK and clients, because Insight has been a great
acquisition that's produced a lot of flows for you in the past. So I'm curious on impacts in the quarter [ph] when
(00:28:16) you get more collateral [ph] but (00:28:17) clients have lower balances and what you think clients are
going to do with this business going forward. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Well, good morning, Glenn, and thanks for the question. Obviously, this topic's been in the news a lot over
the course of the past few weeks. Let's maybe just start by stepping back and remember what LDI actually stands
for and what it is. So it's liability-driven investing and the principle at work as I think you know, but let me just
recap it, is really the investment approach that ensures that the assets, ultimately, are moving more in line with
the value of the liabilities.
And so we think that principle, which has been very important to the pension space over time is an important one,
and it's going to be something that we would expect to continue. I mean these strategies have been employed by
many years. They've been extensively embraced by the pension regulators in the UK and then the consultants
who advise our pension clients in the space.
The second thing I'd say is that, more broadly, higher interest rates have actually served to improve the funding
positions of most pension funds because the value of the liabilities has decreased by more than the decreases in
their gilt holdings. And so that has been a net positive in terms of contributing to the pension funds funding status.
But look, clearly, as you pointed out, the speed and the magnitude of the rise in the UK government bond yields
has been pretty unprecedented and certainly has created challenges in the market with the sort of speed and
magnitude of everything that's been going on. And that's created issues, including liquidity issues, for many of
these pension funds, who've had to sell gilts and mobilize other forms of liquidity in order to be able to meet the
margin calls on derivatives. And as you know, they are the [ph] principle (00:30:06) on the derivatives.
This has clearly put a strain on the markets. I mean, the sheer size of the pension market versus the UK gilt
market, just sort of shows the degree of impact that they can have. And it's also highlighted some operational
challenges. If you just think about the two day settlement of margin versus the time to liquidate assets across the
wider asset pools, and that's been exacerbated actually by some operational providers. We actually don't provide
direct operational support to Insight. That's done by a third-party. And what's happened as a result of all of that,
well, clearly, people are raising additional liquidity, which makes a lot of sense.
Now we've been pleased – to the other part of your question, we've been pleased with Insight's performance.
They've been focused actually on building collateral buffers throughout the year, and this prudence, I think, has
10


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
been quite helpful in protecting client portfolios. And Insight's also been, over time, working on a strategy that they
called integrated solutions, which is really encouraging pension funds to be able to look across all of the types of
assets that they have so that they see the whole and not just the individual pieces.
So the investment of maybe less liquid components is done with a mind and a view to what's being done and
where leverage might exist elsewhere in the portfolio. And I think that that integrated approach which they've been
a big proponent of has actually been a good solution in this particular crisis. And so we actually think that, net-net,
our solutions being strengthened in the market, Insight's reputation has done quite well. In fact, they are turning
away new business as they've seen and benefited, frankly, from the incomings and a bit of the flight to quality.
So clearly, a situation that's still evolving. Today's market looks a little bit better following some of the news at the
end of last week and over the weekend. But we're watching it very closely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
So I appreciate all that color. I follow everything and it feels like nothing on balance sheet risk, didn't have major
client outflows. The last part I wasn't sure about is why would they be turning away new business? Or are clients
not going to use this as much forward or just use less leverage. I'm curious on your outlook. Again, I think it was a
good source of flows in the past, and just [audio gap] (00:32:31) what you think going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. So the reason why we've been turning away some new business is because, really, we want to protect the
interest of our existing clients. And so taking on more problematic situations, and there are some in the market
which have less funding and liquidity available, and then essentially taking them into our franchise and having to
deal with that problem, this didn't seem like the smartest moments to do that and also, frankly, wasn't in the
interest of our existing clients who've been along with Insight along the journey. So that's actually the reason
there.
But more broadly, we do expect to continue to get incoming phone calls given some of the differentiated nature of
how Insight's performed through this, and we view that to be positive for the franchise. So actually, I view that as
something of a tailwind because these types of reputational events in the market, frankly, can sift out some of the
different players.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So Robin, I noticed that the AUC/A declined just about 2% quarter-over-quarter. This would be less than we'd
expect given the market backdrop here. You talked about the strong sales momentum and recent wins. So how
much did organic growth contribute this quarter, if you could kind of quantify that? And when did that come in, in
the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hi, good morning. It's Emily, I'll take that. The AUC/A, it really speaks to the – trends in AUC/A speak to the
diversity of the franchise overall. So firm-wide, AUC/A was down about 7%. That was based on lower Securities
Services AUC/A of about 11%, but very much tempered by growth in Market and Wealth Services, led by CCM.
If you want to kind of drill down a bit more in terms of Securities Services and what you're seeing there about –
the 11% decline, about 13% of that was due to lower market values as well as the strengthening US dollar, and
that was partially offset by about 2% of net new business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you, Emily. And then – and if I heard your comments correctly on the share buybacks, it
sounds like it's really dependent on the capital levels. But did I understand that correctly that it's still possible that
you will – that you could be in the market for buybacks this quarter if the capital levels perform as expected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
As I said in my prepared remarks, and it's very important that everyone really understands, we're going to
continue to be prudent with respect to buybacks. So I think that's natural given the continued volatility that we're
seeing across the markets and. frankly, the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We also – we do want to be
above our internal targets for our capital ratios before we consider resuming buybacks.
So it is true that when we think about capital distribution, frankly, our approach hasn't changed, whether it's this
quarter or next quarter, it's always going to be informed by the rate trajectory and the corresponding impact on
AOCI, the size of our balance sheet, market conditions, of course, and frankly, our forward outlook.
But what I would remind everybody is that beyond the near term, we have a business model that really allows a
meaningful amount of return to – of our capital to shareholders and pending the sale of Alcentra as well as over
time, as rates do move in a different direction that AOCI will be pulling back to par, and that will – both of those
things will free up meaningful capital levels.

Wanted to start-off with a question on the operating margin. While the operating backdrop, Robin, as you noted
remains highly uncertain. In the last Fed tightening cycle, the company was generating mid-30s operating margins
fairly consistently, so well above current levels. I just wanted to get your perspective or take on whether you see a
credible path to getting to those type – back to those types of operating margins? And what are some of the
drivers that could potentially help you close the gap here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, Steven. Well, I'll just start by reminding you, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but when we
announced our re-segmentation in December last year, Emily and I both commented on the fact that we were
driving towards a 30% plus margin in our Securities Services segment, which, as you know, is not where we have
been. And we said at the time that was going to be made up of a variety of different components. It was going to
be top line organic growth. It was also going to be, of course, the rate cycle, which is a meaningful contributor.
And we do view that as an important contributor to our firm. And then third, it was going to be through focus on
the bottom line.
And so if you take that as a microcosm for a second, that's exactly how I think about the strategy for the whole
firm. We're laser-focused on executing on our growth investments. Things like Pershing X, real-time payments
and some of the other things that I've detailed before. But we also have to be a very good steward of expenses
and although we've made significant investments in resiliency over the course of the past four to five years, I feel
that there is more room for us to be able to invest in efficiency-related technology. So investing in technology on
the top line and the bottom line, but with a more sense of tangible payoffs that are available than maybe we've
seen in the resiliency space, which is really a cost of doing business.
Emily can comment maybe just for a moment on our budget process because we're in that season and we've
adjusted our budget process to really try to get at this margin question that you raised.

Sure. So we are, as Robin said, intensely focused on our forward expense trajectory. And in the budget cycle that
we've just kicked off, we're actually doubling down on a rubric that we've actually used historically, but mostly just
for tech, and now we're looking at it and applying that rubric across the entire company. And in effect, what we're
doing is stratifying all of our expenses across three buckets. So first is really structural or run the bank. Second is
change the bank and we're really drilling into that category to be very clear about if we're making investments, are
they for growth, are they to transform or for that matter, are they to continue to meet ongoing regulatory
obligations.
And third, of course – the third bucket is just revenue related, which obviously rise with top line growth. So I can
share that as we go through this, more than 50% of our expenses are structural in nature. They are certainly
higher than we think they should be, as Robin has alluded to. And we're very heavily focused on driving these
down.
In some areas, we have multi-year programs like transfer agency, fund accounting, et cetera, which our
businesses that are highly manual in nature, and we do have programs to make them more efficient, and we'll
come back to you when we finish the planning process.

Thanks for all that color. It's really helpful perspective. And maybe just for my follow-up on the deposit outlook,
Emily, you noted that the non-interest bearing outflows have been tracking better so far this cycle. And as a
percentage of total deposits, it's still fairly elevated at 28%, I believe, last cycle at trough somewhere around 22%.
What's your expectation in terms of the pace of non-interest bearing outflow, what's driving the better outcome
this cycle? And where do you expect NIBs to ultimately trough this cycle relative to last?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I think I've mentioned and we still believe that NIBs will ultimately revert to what we saw pre-pandemic, which
would be about 20% to 25% of our total deposit base. We actually think that, that might happen here in the fourth
quarter.
In terms of why they've held so, so steady, I think some of that is probably risk-off behavior. Some of that is just
our businesses are a bit bigger. And ultimately, what I would say is that we have seen when we look at our
deposit trend overall, and this is very important, irrespective NIBs or IBs, the runoff we've seen thus far has been
largely non-operational in nature and that's actually good. We're seeing the right run-off, and I think very much
due to our very – what's become much more sophisticated pricing across clients and segments in businesses.

...give us more color on the goodwill charge. What specifically was the driver of the charge this quarter? And does
it give you more flexibility on your strategy and investment management?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Happy to. So first of all, let's be clear about what it is and what it isn't. So it's not the outcome of any
changes in our strategy. It's also not related to the pending sale of Alcentra. And it's also not a statement about
the fundamental health of the business as we see it today and going forward.
It is the outcome of our regular impairment testing process, and it's a reflection of both the lower market values
that we've seen across equity and fixed income markets and also a higher discount rate.
So inevitably wrapped up in your question is the strategy. And so maybe I'll just recap for a second, where we are
on that investment management journey. As you know, over the course of the past 15 years or so, we've
streamlined the investment portfolio. We used to have 27 independent investment management firms. That's
down to seven once Alcentra is closed. That helps us to sharpen our focus as does the fact that we've improved
substantially the alignment between strategy and the individual firms. And so we've realigned Mellon's investment
capabilities into parts of Newton and Insight and Dreyfus. We think that helps make it less confusing for our
clients externally and sharpens the focus internally.
We're also investing in the types of solutions that, of course, people want in this day and age and some of those
outcome orientated solutions, active ETFs, responsible investing. We talked about BOLD, I think, on our last
earnings call in the money market fund space. It's another example of that. And then very importantly, in the
investment management space, the investment performance has improved and remains healthy. So kind of that's
where we are.

Operator: We will now take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. So there's been a number of liquidity challenges in the
market, and Robin, you alluded to those in your prepared remarks as well. So as BK serves, obviously, a fairly
critical function in sort of the capital markets plumbing globally, what are some of the risks, I guess, you're most
mindful of that that we should be looking after. And as you think about any opportunities that this kind of
environment creates for the bank as well, would love to hear your thoughts on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So Alex, we've got a bunch of different crosscurrents at the moment in the system. On the cash side, we're
coming off the back of QE. Central bank is, obviously, driving very aggressively at inflation, clearly necessary
given the continued prints. But then on the flip side, and these two things don't necessarily always happen at the
same time, which is what makes it complicated is we've got supply chain issues, ongoing geopolitics, energy
prices, risks of recession, already very much front and center. And so we've got sort of a risk on and risk off
angles happening at the same time.
We've also seen some pretty unprecedented starting places for some of these markets. And I think that's a little
bit for us where we see some of the concern, which is the usual toolkits around market stability aren't available in
maybe quite the same way. You saw that in the UK, where just to take that as a microcosm for a second, their
bond market goes through a little bit of tumult as a result of some news in the government actions. And at the
time, the Bank of England was still in the QT process, which they had to suspend to then go do some buying. You
just can't really be doing buying and selling at the same time.
That's a good example of the fact that the toolkits aren't fully available. We look at the scale of moves in the
market and we look at the amounts of liquidity and so much has been done in the banking sector, particularly over
the course of the past decade post financial regulatory reform, the regulators have been very much at it. So
banks, massive amounts of liquidity, large amounts of capital very well set up for this. But if you have huge selling
from other market constituents, there is a little bit of a question there of where the buyer is going to be. And we
see echoes of that in the UK market. There are legitimate concerns about that in the US market, if there were a
significant episode as we've seen in the past, what does that pivot looks like.
And to some extent, those are the consequences of having and benefiting from the most liquid markets in the
world on a normal basis and also being the place where people store their cash. And when they want cash, they
need it back and they're selling.
So the question becomes who are the buyers. We've seen the central bank of Japan having to be sellers of
treasuries as they defend their currency. So there's a lot going on in the world, and it's a bit complex. But I think
we have a healthy amount of caution as we saw this play out over the course of the coming weeks and months.

Got you. All right. Thanks. And then my follow-up just around the LDI dynamic again, and I appreciate your
comments around Insight on the asset management side. But I guess, as a servicer, curious how you're thinking
about your exposure to UK pension plans on the Asset Servicing side of the business, either as custodian or
middle of back office administrator. Any sort of implications for fees or deposits we should be thinking about as
you give pensions post more collateral?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. It's been pretty business as usual for us on the servicing side. As I mentioned before, that isn't the case
everywhere. Clearly, there have been issues in that market, and there were a couple of providers who've had
some more stresses associated with the massive upsurge in volumes, but that has not been our experience.
Clearly, there is more cash in the market generally.
And let me just make a broader point about cash, because I think it's very interesting position for us as a
company. The various different roles that we play in cash because – yes, we have deposits on our balance sheet,
that tends to be a lot of the focus that we talk about in terms of cash. But we actually manage over $1 trillion of
daily liquidity for our clients in markets all around the world. And this goes way beyond deposits on our balance
sheet. It goes to our money market fund business, it goes to a market-leading liquidity direct portal, which helps
treasurers and other cash managers be able to direct cash through the system.
And so we actually feel pretty well positioned as a company on the topic of cash, because sort of irrespective of
exactly where the flow is heading, we set ourselves in a little bit of an orchestration role in the middle of that,
which we think is really quite good for our franchise over time.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. I'm going to answer my question, I think, which you're guiding a little bit lower for fees, but you're not
guiding lower for expenses. And I guess the answer is, because you're looking to invest through the cycle, if you
can validate that? And then just more on the digital asset custody platform, you said that custody of digital assets
and crypto are simply the start of a journey. And there's a lot written pro and con as it relates to digital currencies.
Clearly, you think this has legs. Maybe that's one reason why you're going to invest maybe more even with softer
fees, but if you could elaborate on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Mike, let me – I'll take the whole thing. So first of all, in terms of – we're not re-guiding on expenses. Emily
said that the original guidance of 5% to 5.5% is intact, but she also said that we're aiming towards the lower end
of that range. So that's meant to be sort of a vote of confidence in our own active management of expenses,
which we're really driving at and we are very, very focused, as Emily said earlier on, on this journey. And so you
should expect us to continue to give you updates on how we do on that over time.
Let me talk a little bit about digital assets because it is a very important question, and I tried to stress this in my
prepared remarks around the fact that it really isn't just about crypto. So, one of the things that we did recently
was, we did a survey of large institutional asset managers, asset owners, hedge funds. About 40% of them
already hold crypto in their portfolios. About 75% of them are actively investing or exploring investing in digital
assets. But here's the important stat, which is over 90% of them are interested in investing in some type of
tokenized asset within the next few years.
And so, what we heard from our clients is they want institutional grade solutions in the space. And the way that
we think about the world is, yeah sure, there are cryptos and those are things that clearly have had a lot of
spotlight recently, but we view the tokenization of other types of assets, whether they're traditional financial assets
or maybe assets that haven't been as easy to manage in the financial system, like hard commodities, real estate,
forests, there are all sorts of things. You could think about certificates and with the world of ESG, some of those
things could be much better managed using tokens. And then also tokenized currencies where real currencies,
fiat currencies or proxies for fiat currencies, we also think could be quite interesting.
Now all of this is over the course of the next few years. The actual dematerialization of assets from paper into
technology back in the 1960s and 1970s took a long time to actually happen. It was not coincidentally happening
with the rise of computing in business. Now we've got a new technology, the rise of that in business, we think is
going to be important but I'm not going to put an exact time scale on it, but it's years, maybe it's even decades for
full adoption. But we thought that with a longer-term view, this was an important space.
Now we're not spending a ton of money on it, but we're deliberately investing in smart places in that ecosystem,
so that we are prepared to be there for our clients over the long term on this important journey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And what was the tipping point, just as a follow-up, the tipping point for you to really highlight this. I mean this is
front and center here. This was the third area that you've mentioned investing. You said Pershing X, collateral,
digital assets, real-time payments. This was number three on your list. So certainly, it's moved up in priority. And
18


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
crypto has been around a little while now. What was the tipping point here? Was it a new survey of your clients?
Did you see something in the market? What's changed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I mentioned the survey. The survey wasn't the tipping point, but it was an affirmation. But the answer to your
question is client demand. Our clients want institutional grade custody and solutions in this space. And I enjoyed
the quip that I read in the media maybe a year or so ago, which is, you know what, it's not a real asset until BNY
Mellon say they'll look after it.

Operator: We will now take our next question from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of follow-ups on deposits. So, Emily, you've previously
indicated that you had expected by fourth quarter that deposits on an average basis would be down 5% to 10%.
They were actually down – they're already down 7% based on the 3Q average. Should we still think about that
range of 5% to 10% or might that end up being different? And maybe if you could update on how beta is tracking
in your expectation there, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Good morning, Brennan. So you're correct, I did guide, I think it was around second quarter that we'd
expect a decline of about 5% to 10% by – well, average to average Q2 to Q4. In the third quarter as you also
rightfully pointed out, deposits down 7%. Now, that's in part due to the strengthening of the US dollar, which was a
headwind of about 1% and also just seasonality, just that you normally see lower deposit levels in the third
quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we are anticipating a decline of about 3% to 4%. And as I mentioned before, we expect it to
be mostly in NIBs as the – percentage of NIBs as a total of our deposit base kind of reverts back to pre-pandemic
levels. And like anything, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. So this is what we are anticipating based on the
forward curve and ultimately – the forward curve and what we have been seeing so far this year.
In terms of betas, betas do continue to be a little better than we had anticipated. Just as a note, they do vary
widely by line of business. So Treasury Services and Markets are -certainly have much higher betas than say,
Asset Servicing or Corporate Trust. So it's just important to keep that in mind. Looking ahead, we do expect
marginal betas to continue to ramp higher as rates continue to rise. But at the end of the day, we do think that
they will largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle and so ultimately end up higher than where they are today.
And again, I would just say that's just another factor, whether it's deposit balances or betas, those are all factors
that are somewhat uncertain based upon the macroeconomic backdrop.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thanks for that. And then another sort of related question. Helpful to get full year 2022 NII
expectation for sure. But when we step back a bit, and think about – I know it's too early to comment on next year,
but just sort of generally speaking, at this point, we've gotten back to triple-digit NIM. Rates continue to be pretty
robust. You think your beta is going to largely retrace last cycle, as you just said, is there any reason why the NIM
can't retrace the prior cycle NIM?
And when we think about the security reinvestment tailwinds for 2023, any reason why once policy rates stop
moving higher, you're going to largely see some stabilization because that's what kicks off most of your deposit
repricing. And then you've got a tailwind from reinvestment that continues to flow through into 2023. Is there
anything wrong with thinking about things that way? And how long do you think it might take for the NIM to... Is it
possible to retrace the last cycle? And how long do you think that might take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, there's a lot there, so let me try to unpack it a bit. As you have seen from our financials, we've seen several
consecutive quarters of sharp increases in NIM. We do expect another step up in the fourth quarter and even
beyond the fourth quarter based on a lot of the factors that you mentioned, we do expect that NIM will continue to
expand but probably at a slower rate.
In terms of portfolio positioning, we do actually think that rates will continue to surprise to the upside. And so,
we're therefore really positioned for greater asset sensitivity. But of course, we can continue to be nimble there.
And as we think about the portfolio overall, obviously, we're managing it with the objective of optimizing capital,
liquidity, as well as NIR.

Good morning. That was kind of my question on net interest income as well, maybe just one point on that. Just
technical on the Fed funds purchased spread, that's seen on the asset and liability side. I see that spread went up
to about $72 million in 3Q versus $38 million in the second quarter. I guess how should we think about that book
20


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
as more of a matched book with a spread sort of contained in that area? Or actually, is that poised to dramatically
rise in the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think on that particular question, I think it's just best to follow up specifically with IR.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
If you're asking more specifically about the kind of the outlook for NIR, which is kind of the broader-based
question. Based on the forward curve that we see today, we would probably expect some growth from our Q4 exit
rate.
And just to kind of talk a bit about the drivers there. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, we expect central banks to
continue to increase rates and they'll probably remain elevated for most of the year. We do think that a large
majority of the deposit outflows will be behind us by year-end. And again, that's largely because our client base is
institutional, more rate sensitive than sensitive to the size of the balance sheet. We could have a little bit more
run-off, but we do expect also some organic growth. NIBs as I've already talked about, and marginal betas will
increase.
So, all of those factors just are kind of coming into the fact that we would expect some growth from our fourth
quarter exit rates. Of course, lots of uncertainties.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's great color. And maybe if I can pivot to the organic growth initiatives that you talked about in your
prepared remarks, Robin, maybe if you could just focus on real-time payments. You've talked a lot about Pershing
X recently and, of course, the digital platform.
But maybe just, if you can talk a little bit about sort of the – what you're thinking in that area, and to what extent
you think these initiatives can enhance that organic growth rate? I don't know if it's too early to put out a target
there for 2% or 3%? Or do you think we're going to stay in the sort of 1% plus range for a little while?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, it's a little too early for a specific target. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're working through all of
the various different businesses, understanding the priorities for each one. And as we come out of all of that, we'll
have a better sense from that part of the question.
But let me talk about real-time payments, because I think this is quite interesting for a few different reasons. It is a
new payment rail. And whenever there's a disruption or a change in the ecosystem, you have some degree of
change in sort of the established order or at least the opportunity for that disruption. And so for us, we think that
those opportunities don't come along every day. And so we're quite focused on taking advantage of that.
21


The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
(BK) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
But it's also part of a broader solution set, because providing faster payments is nice and safer payments is good.
But when it's combined with the ability to do digital invoicing in the request for payment and when that's combined
with payment validation, fraud protection and other data services, they can become very interesting solutions for
clients. And we view ourselves as not just a payment provider, but a platform provider for entry into the banking
system. And we think this is where it overlaps very nicely.
You'll remember that we cover 97% of the world's top 100 banks. That makes us with that installed customer base
and then the leadership on the product side, it makes us a very appealing partner for FinTechs and regional
banks as they are thinking about wanting to take advantage of all those capabilities, but either because they don't
actually want to be a bank in the case of some FinTechs or in the case of the fact that it's very expensive to make
all of this investment, and we've done that in the case of other regional banks.
We're now providing access to RTP, Zelle, account validation, soon to be FedNow, white label solutions and with
the real-time invoicing. And we think that whoever gets that collective set of rails up and running, really frankly has
an advantage. And as you know, we were the first bank to make real-time payments. We were the first to launch a
real-time e-billing and we're a leading in the whole process with FedNow as part of that rollout as well, working
very closely with the Fed and other banks as well. So it's for all of those reasons that I think this is an interesting
space. We haven't put a number on it, but we're certainly getting franchise traction.

...can you just share with us your way you guys are managing your securities portfolio, in view, I think you said
you think rates will be going higher as we go forward. In terms of the strategies of moving some into held-to-
maturity versus available for sale to protect you on the AOCI. And as you go forward, how are you looking at the
AOCI issue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, as I did say before, we do expect the environment to remain volatile and actually rates to continue to
surprise to the upside. And frankly, we really would need some change in tone from central banks or some

evidence that inflation is declining probably to change our view on that. So we are continuing to position the
portfolio for greater asset sensitivity.
Year-to-date, we have reduced DV01 by about 50%. Duration is also the lowest it's been in a really long time. You
do mention that certainly, we did also take measures earlier in the year to protect against AOCI volatility. And so
we did move a portion of the portfolio, about 40% of it now is in held to maturity that certainly has helped with
diminishing AOCI unrealized losses. They would have been more, of course, than they have been if we had not
taken that action. But ultimately, the portfolio is positioned for greater asset sensitivity.
Having said that, we are going to be very, very nimble and should the environment change, we do benefit actually
from the fact that 60% of the portfolio is designated as available for sale and has a short duration. So we can be
pretty flexible and act very swiftly.

Does it make sense since you have so much in available for sale you're an advanced approach bank, so it's
already going through your CET1 ratio to actually take some realized losses and then redeploy those funds at
higher yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
We feel very comfortable where we are in terms of held to maturity. We really want to retain flexibility and also
certainly want the flexibility around not only managing interest rate risk, but of course, liquidity as well.

Very good. And then just as a follow-up question, I know you've touched a lot about your deposits today in your
answers to questions, just one last question on deposits. QT now is in full speed operation here in the United
States.
Have you noticed any change in the deposit outflows since we've gone to the $94 billion, $95 billion a month? And
how do you – I know you pointed out deposits are going to come down in the fourth quarter. But when you look
out to next year, is that going to change your thinking at all? Or is it behaving as you expected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think as I indicated, deposit outflows are behaving pretty much as we anticipated. We do think the lion's
share of the runoff will be behind us by the end of this year. Why we think that – our client base is predominantly
institutional, in the past and even now they've proven to be much more sensitive to rates than actually just the
size of the Fed's balance sheet.
Also, just as a reminder, our businesses are much bigger. They've grown significantly since what we've seen in
the last cycle.
So Treasury Services is much bigger, AUC/A and Asset Servicing is much bigger where that comes, just naturally
more deposits.

And even what we've seen in the runoff, as I suggested or said before, it's been mostly non-operational.
So I think we feel pretty good about our expectations here and that the large majority is behind us. Having said
that, could there be more runoff?
Yes, I mean there's so much uncertainty, whether it's interest rate volatility, the levels of the RRP, macroeconomic
uncertainty in general. So that's our best estimate based on the forward curve of what we've seen thus far.
