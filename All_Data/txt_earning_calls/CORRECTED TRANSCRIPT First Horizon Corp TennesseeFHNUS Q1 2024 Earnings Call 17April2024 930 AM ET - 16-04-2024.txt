Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The first quarter of 2024 was
another strong quarter for First Horizon, demonstrating our ability to produce consistent returns for our
shareholders. We grew revenue both through expanding our margin and improvement in our countercyclical
businesses while simultaneously reducing expenses and maintaining strong credit performance.
In March, we celebrated our 160th year in business and took the opportunity to celebrate the strength and
resiliency of our company, which has been driven by our dedicated and talented associate base. In honor of our
160th anniversary, we recently announced our Grants for Good campaign, which will award $1.6 million in grants
to non-profit organizations within our 12 state footprint. We believe that the communities where we do business
are the foundation of First Horizon's long record of success, and we are proud to continue to support the clients
and communities in our markets.
On slide 5, we've shared some of the financial highlights for the quarter. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.35 per
share, up 9% from the prior quarter, with pre-provision net revenue up $25 million. Adjusted return on tangible
common equity improved to 11.6%, driven by positive operating leverage as well as the benefit of returning

excess capital to shareholders. Our improved returns resulted from our ability to drive higher revenue in both our
core banking franchise and our countercyclical businesses.
We grew the net interest margin 10 basis points from the fourth quarter from improved pricing on both loans and
deposits, driving a $7 million increase in net interest income. FHN Financial had a stronger quarter as well, with a
$15 million increase in fixed income fees. In January, our board approved a $650 million share repurchase
authorization. We began to return capital to shareholders this quarter, repurchasing over $150 million of stock,
ending the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.3%. We will continue to opportunistically deploy capital
above our 11% near-term target.
As I look forward to the rest of 2024, I remain incredibly optimistic that First Horizon will continue to deliver strong
results quarter after quarter while serving our customers and communities, just as we have over the past 160
years. We have an attractive footprint, a competitive product set, and a strong credit culture that will allow us to
profitably navigate the ever changing economic outlook of the upcoming year.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Hope to run through our financial results in more detail. Hope?

Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. On slide 6, you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for
the quarter. We generated pre-provision net revenue of $323 million, up $25 million from the prior quarter. Net
interest income increased $7 million from fourth quarter, driven by improvements in both deposit and loan pricing,
which expanded the margin by 10 basis points. Fees, excluding deferred comp, were up $13 million from last
quarter, driven by [ph] higher (00:05:34) revenues from our fixed income business, which saw a 58% increase in
ADR.
Expenses excluding deferred comp were down $4 million linked quarter, driven by a significant reduction to
outside services, which as previously mentioned, were elevated in the fourth quarter. That reduction was partially
offset by personnel increases for annual merit, seasonal benefits, and revenue driven incentives within our fixed
income business. Expenses remain a lever that we are able to pull to drive increased profitability. We continue to
identify and implement operational efficiencies across our bank that will help us offset the increase of our strategic
investments to drive enhanced shareholder returns. Provision expense was $50 million in this quarter, resulting in
a stable ACL coverage ratio of 1.4%. Our strong performance improved return on tangible common equity by 60
basis points.
On slide 7, we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter, which reduced results by $0.02 per share. First
quarter notable items include incremental expense of $10 million for the FDIC special assessment, which
stemmed from revised estimates the FDIC provided in February. We also had $5 million of restructuring expenses
associated with personnel initiatives, as we remain focused on finding operational efficiencies. We also noted an
upcoming event in second quarter.
On April 1, First Horizon provided notice that it will redeem all outstanding shares of the Series D preferred stock
on May 1. The Series D shares were acquired during the Iberia merger of equals and do not qualify for capital
treatment, as the first call date was in a five-year window. The interest rate was set to convert from a fixed coupon
to a three-month SOFR+ 4.12% in May. Second quarter will include an approximately $7 million non-cash charge
associated with retirement of this instrument.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
On slide 8, you will see that margin expanded 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.37%, improving NII by $7
million. First quarter benefited from a full quarter of repricing on the promotional deposits gathered in 2023, with
interest bearing deposit costs declining 9 basis points from prior quarter. Loan yields also expanded 9 basis
points from the benefit of wider spreads on new and renewing loans, as well as the ability to redeploy lower
yielding fixed rate cash flows. The path for deposit cost over the rest of the year will depend on when the Fed
decides to cut rates, as well as the level of competition we see in our markets. Meanwhile, loan yields still have
room to modestly expand as fixed cash flows continue to reprice.
As you can see on slide 9, we've successfully maintained deposit balances while reducing our deposit cost.
Period end deposits are flat quarter-to-quarter with a 5 basis point reduction to the total deposit rate and a 9 basis
point reduction to the interest bearing rate paid. We continue to see strong retention on the promotional deposits
repriced last quarter with about 90% retention on both the number of clients and the balances. We had a modest
increase in brokered balances as contracts initiated in 2023, funded up ahead of approximately $800 million of
brokered CDs maturing in the second quarter. Though, we continue to see some rotation out of non-interest
bearing in January, balances were relatively flat since February.
We have an overview of our diversified loan portfolio on slide 10. Period end loans were up 1% from the prior
quarter. Loans to mortgage companies are up 17% or $343 million at period end. So average balances were
down slightly due to typical seasonality in the business. CRE loans are up $210 million, driven by fund-ups,
primarily in multifamily. We added some additional CRE detail in the appendix this quarter, including a
geographical breakdown that illustrates the granularity and attractive footprint of the portfolio. Loan yields are up 9
basis points, continuing to benefit from wider spreads on new and renewing loans, as well as continued repricing
of fixed rate cash flows. Spreads on new loans increased 46 basis points year-over-year. Fixed rate cash flows
should continue to be a tailwind as we have $4 billion cash flows coming back over the next year with a roll off
yield of approximately 4.4%.
On slide 11, you can see that our countercyclical businesses had a relatively strong quarter. Average daily
revenue in our fixed income business increased $268,000 from fourth quarter, contributing an additional $15
million of fee income. The rebound this quarter was driven by improving liquidity conditions in the banking sector
and the market's expectation that short-term rates have peaked and were likely headed lower. Though the recent
inflation numbers have reduced the prospect of rate cuts, we expect business will remain solid, though not as
strong as first quarter levels.
Mortgage revenue also increased by $4 million, primarily due to higher volumes. Service charges and fees
decreased $2 million due to seasonality and overdraft fees. Card and digital banking fees rebounded $3 million as
fourth quarter included a non-recurring impact from accounting methodology adjustment on interchange rebates.
Lastly, our non-interest income declined $6 million, mostly due to lower FHLB dividends, as well as a modest
reduction in letter of credit and swap fees.
Slide 12, we show that excluding deferred compensation, adjusted expenses are down $4 million. Personnel
excluding deferred comp was up $17 million from last quarter with a couple of drivers. First, salaries and benefits
are up $9 million due to our annual merit increase, which were effective January 1, and seasonality in certain
benefits lines such as 401(k) match and unemployment compensation.
Second, incentives and commissions increased $7 million, driven by incentives on the fixed income revenue
growth. Offsetting these personnel increases is a significant decrease to outside services. As a reminder, our
fourth quarter marketing expense was elevated for deposit and brand campaigns, as well as third-party services
engaged on our strategic investments. As 2024 progresses, we expect technology investment expenses to

moderately increase over the year, but those costs will be offset by lower retention expenses and continuing to
identify and implement operational efficiencies.
I'll cover asset quality reserves on slide 13. Loan loss provision was $50 million this quarter, flat to prior quarter.
Net charge-offs were $40 million or 27 basis points. Our largest charge-off this quarter was a $9 million C&I loan
to a consumer goods company, for which we were already fully reserved. We also had $12 million of partial
charge-downs on three commercial real estate loans based on updated appraisal values. The ACL coverage ratio
remained stable at 1.40%. We've provided additional detail in the appendix that gives some insight into the
diversification and granularity of our loan portfolio. We have remained disciplined in underwriting and our
approach to client selection. While we have seen some additional negative grade migration in the first quarter,
overall, we continue to see stable credit performance across markets and industries.
On slide 14, you can see that we have maintained strong capital levels while successfully deploying capital to
shareholders through the repurchase of almost 11 million shares, utilizing approximately [ph] $150 million
(00:14:39) of our $650 million of share repurchase authority. Share repurchases drove a 9 basis point reduction in
capital this quarter, while CET1 remains very strong at 11.3%. Adjusting for the marks on our securities portfolio
and loan book, our pro forma CET1 ratio would be 8.8%, which is well above the regulatory threshold. We will
continue to opportunistically deploy capital above our 11% near-term target. First quarter tangible book value per
share increased to $12.16, benefiting by $0.35 of net income, offset by $0.15 of dividends, $0.15 from higher
mark-to-market impacts, and $0.04 of share buybacks.
On slide 15, we've updated our 2024 outlook slightly to reflect better than expected performance in our
countercyclical businesses. We continue to expect our full year NII growth to fall within the 1% to 4% range that
we originally outlined. We have updated our assumptions for interest rates to reflect the forward curve for March,
which includes cuts in June, September and November. Though the market's expectations have continued to
evolve over the last few weeks, we do not believe it will have a material impact to our outlook.
We saw strong performance from our countercyclical business in the first quarter with fixed income fees of $15
million and mortgages up $4 million from prior quarter. We expect these businesses to continue to perform well,
which has improved our outlook for non-interest income growth from a range of 4.6% previously to an updated 6%
to 10%. The expense outlook remains unchanged, despite increases to revenue-driven incentives and our
countercyclical businesses due to the benefit of the operational efficiencies we have implemented.
I will wrap up on slide 16, which is a slide that you have all seen a few times now. But it really drives home that we
are focused on a company in order to maximize shareholder value. First quarter was a great start to 2024, and I
believe this is the beginning to a strong year for First Horizon. We expect to deliver better revenue performance
that we laid out in our original guidance while finding operational efficiencies to maintain our expense guidance.
We are making tremendous progress on the strategic investments we have been talking about for almost a year
now, and these initiatives will allow us to offer our clients and associates better products, better service, and
improved efficiency.
First Horizon has a diversified business model that can provide top quartile results throughout any cycle. We are
well-positioned to capitalize on our 160-year legacy with our passionate and dedicated bankers, clients and
communities. We will continue to demonstrate our commitment, strength and resiliency while increasing
shareholder returns.
Now I'll give it back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our franchise and the ability to improve
profitability in an extremely competitive industry. As Hope mentioned, our teams have made great progress over
the last year on our strategic investments, which will allow our associates to serve our clients more quickly and
efficiently. I continue to remain confident that this company has the people, the clients and the enthusiasm to build
an unparalleled banking franchise in the South. My expectation is that the next few months for the economy will
look similar to the first quarter, which gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to generate strong returns for
our shareholders throughout the rest of the year.
Finally, I want to touch on the announcement we made Monday that our Chief Credit Officer, Susan Springfield,
has decided to retire later this year. We have named Tom Hung as her successor. Tom currently runs our
franchise finance business and brings a wealth of credit and client experience to the role. We have already
started the transition process with Tom serving as Deputy Chief Credit Officer as he prepares to officially step into
the role on October, 1. Susan will remain with the company until the end of the year to help ensure a seamless
transition.
Susan's decision to retire is bittersweet and she will be greatly missed. She has been with the company for nearly
30 years, having served as Chief Credit Officer for 11 of those years. She led us adeptly through a number of
credit cycles, maintaining strong credit quality under her leadership. She has been a vital member of our
Executive Management Committee, as well as a mentor and role model to countless young professionals
throughout her distinguished career. We're incredibly grateful for her steadfast leadership and her unwavering
devotion to our team and our clients. Thank you, Susan.
Karla, we can now open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Bryan. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from
Bank of America. Your line is open.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, Bryan. How are you? I guess maybe just first question for Hope around NII outlook. In the past, Hope, you
provided spot rates on deposit costs. Just give us, if you don't mind, if you can drill down into what the spot rate
was at the end of 1Q? And how we should think about that drifting higher, I'm assuming if we don't get much in
terms of rate cuts for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Ebrahim. Good to hear from you this morning. Our spot rate at the end of the quarter was slightly up on
interest bearing and total deposits on average kind of flat. Well, some of it is mix, some of it's timing. So I really
want to focus on what was our overall deposit cost for the quarter. Our betas went from a peak of [ph] 63 down to
60 (00:21:23). We continue to – has momentum in retaining the balances and repricing them. We're probably at
the bottom of being able to reprice those promotional deposits and we are seeing increased competition.
As you mentioned, the longer it takes us to get that first rate cut, the harder I think it's going to be to continue to
drive deposit costs down meaningfully. We could be a couple of basis points here or there within a month, or a
spot rate within a quarter. But I think we're probably close to where the deposit costs will be for the rest of the year
within 1%, maybe on the beta on either side. It is really hard to predict. The market is just changing so quick and
competition will slow one month and then pick up the next week. And so it's going to be kind of a month by month
look for the industry, I think. Bryan, do you want to add...

No, go ahead, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. No, I guess just taking a step back when we look at that 1% to 4% NII guide. Is the delta going to be
around what gets you to 4%? Is it going to be just loan growth or whether or not we get any rate cuts? What's
more impactful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Ebrahim, if we get to the higher end of that guidance, we would definitely have to see less rates cuts. We
have an asset sensitive balance sheet. And so with less rate cuts, puts us at the higher end more rate cuts put to
the lower end. The thing that I can't handicap right now, within 1% to 2% on the full year, is what are the deposit
cost going to be for the rest of the year? We had originally given guidance, assuming we see a rate cut at some
point early half the year and we start to see competition for deposit costs be going down as an industry. And if we
don't see any rate cut, we don't see rate cuts until late in the year. That's where it gets a little harder for me to
predict. But think about it as, we'll be on the lower end with the current curve and less rate cuts is more positive
for us to get to the higher end of that guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
You'll remember when we laid out that guidance in the fourth quarter, we laid it out based on four rate cuts in
2024. And the over and under betting seems to be we're going to – the market as two today and there are
questions about whether we get two or not. So that would dictate it. So deposit and loan pricing will both be
affected by how many cuts we actually do get.
As Hope pointed out, the most important aspect of managing the margin is we're not playing solitaire, we're doing
this on a competitive marketplace. And we've seen pricing competition increase fairly significantly. And I think
you're seeing that show up in some of the earnings releases that are out there. And so we'll continue to protect
our deposit base. We'll continue to protect our customer base. And we'll continue to compete on a long term basis
of growing the franchise. I would say we're every bit as focused on managing both sides of the balance sheet.
You saw improvement on our loan spreads and you've seen improvement on deposit pricing. And we think that
will continue. We just think it's sort of stabilized at this point, given what's going on competitively.

Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned
that loan yields have the potential to move higher just as cash flows continue to mature. Can you just give us a
sense for what the magnitude of that could be? And Bryan, if you can just generally comment on loan demand in
some of your markets at this point, obviously, I think some areas of commercial real estate, a little bit weaker, but
you are seeing some fund-ups from existing commitments and just what you're seeing generally on the C&I side?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Michael. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do have a fair amount of cash flow coming in
that, we will be able to redeploy. From a loan growth perspective, we're forecasting kind of flat to maybe slightly
up. As we look at where to redeploy that mortgage warehouse, is one of those that is a seasonal product for us
and tends to fund up in Q2 and Q3. And it's our highest yielding asset that we have where – so when we look at
kind of how will the year project, you do need to look at the seasonality of that business.
We continue to see our renewing business and new business expanding margins anywhere from 150 basis points
spread all the way up to 300 basis points and some above 300 basis points in our top businesses. And so when
we think about our specialty businesses, they have a higher spread. When you think about regional businesses,
they are slightly on the lower end of that. But feel confident that we will be able to, even with slowing the loan
demand, that we'll be able to put this into our portfolio on the client side and be able to be there for our existing
clients and bring new clients into the First Horizon franchise with an expanding loan margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Michael, I'll pick-up on loan demand. Loan demand is okay. It's not great. It really is in pockets that you see real
strength. You have some aspects of the Carolinas where loan demand has been very good. And you see other
pockets where is probably a bit softer. As you mentioned, we do have the benefit of some fund-up on some
existing relationships. And you started to see the tick up in seasonality in our mortgage warehouse lending
business, and that's usually stronger in the second and third quarters of the year as the move-in season kicks in.
But overall, we're still seeing good opportunities. We're still being very selective about how and where we
participate, particularly on price and structure. But we're looking for long-term growth and really those
generational opportunities to move business. But I expect that the loan demand is likely to remain somewhat
more modest, broadly speaking, in the economy, simply because we're in that space between rates not going up
anymore and rates not coming down. And I think people are still a little bit cautious and it's going to take a little bit
more certainty about when the Fed is going to move. And I think people will start to lean in.
The economy is still very good in our view relative to all that's going on in the world and how much rates have
been moving up. And as you know, we benefit from being in a sector of the US in the South that has a very strong
general economic dynamic. So we think that loan demand will be fairly soft, but improve over the course of the
year.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great color. And maybe just as my follow-up, maybe one for Susan and congratulations on your upcoming
retirement. Well deserved. Can you just describe what drove kind of the increase in non-performers? And then if
you have an update to the criticized balances at quarter-end, I think they were a little over $2 billion at the end of
the fourth quarter. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. Thanks. And thanks, Michael, for the nice comments. As it relates to new non-performing, we saw non-
performing go up of about $43 million and that's a just a few new non-performing loans. That increase was largely
driven by two credits. One was a senior living facility, a senior living, assisted living memory care facility, and the
other was a consumer finance company. Again, so we're seeing some slight movement in NPLs. We're still
seeing it kind of not any specific industry or sector.
And as it relates to credit size, we have had a continued focus on conservative grading and as we somewhat
seasonal getting in year-end financials on borrowers, we did see criticized balances go up about 20%. But most –
much of that was been on special mention, it's kind of a watch status. So those are not defined weaknesses at
this point. They're more a potential weaknesses where we're just taking a more frequent look working with
borrowers.
The other thing I'm really pleased to see, and this is in commercial real estate as well as C&I, is borrower is really
coming to the table, wanting to work with us, we're wanting to work with them. And we've seen good opportunities
to bring in additional equity reserves, et cetera, as we have plans that may be temporarily challenged due to
interest rate environments. And then classified loans were up less than 10% quarter-over-quarter.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
It's like trying to pronounce Hope's last name. It's just challenging. Just Susan for you. Just to follow-up on
Michael's question, anything new or surprising that you're seeing on credit? And what do you think we should
expect on non-performing trends for 2024? Can you just set the expectation there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I don't really seeing anything that surprises me. Again, we're still, look, each one kind of has its stories.
We're talking borrower, about borrower. We've had a number of deep-dives and portfolio reviews across lines of
business in different regions, great conversations with our bankers about what's going on. Our bankers are having
great conversations with clients.
As I mentioned earlier to Michael's question, still really pleased to see how we're able to be at the table, talk about
rightsizing a loan or what do we need to do, what do you think is going to happen, getting updated projections
from clients. So we still feel good about to have ultimate performance of the portfolio. I think depending on what
happens with interest rates, Jon, that's probably going to affect it. Obviously, if we start seeing rates start to go
down, I think you'll see nonperforming loans start to slow in terms of any increases.
The good news about not having any increased rates right now, though, you're seeing a lot of borrowers who
have adapted to this new interest rate environment, whether it's able to pass along costs in their businesses or
just learning how to do things differently, being more efficient. Learning how to operate in the higher interest rate
environment. So it just we're still being cautious, but I mentioned, we're always selective. We're disciplined in how
we underwrite discipline in client selection. And so that's serving us well, but we're keeping an eye on the

D. Bryan Jordan A

Jon, I would add to that. I'm not really surprised at all by anything I see in terms of credit performance. Or you're
getting what you would expect with higher inflation and higher interest rates and a lot of movement at a fairly short
period of time. And across the entire economy, you're going to have borrowers who are a little more stressed by
that is going to show up in terms of their performance. I would say Susan and her credit teams, as well as our
relationship teams, our RMs and PMs have been very proactive and doing deep dives through portfolio,
understanding at a transaction level borrowers' financial position, as Susan said, being very proactive and working
with borrowers.
And as Susan also said, we've had a tremendous success with borrowers who want to work with us and stepped
up with rightsizing loans, et cetera. So I'm not surprised and, in fact, I'm very pleased with the performance that I
see given the nature of what's going on in the underlying economy and the way we've structured this loan
portfolio. I'm very comfortable that we're in a pretty good position.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. Fair enough. And then, Hope, for you on slide 8, the bottom of slide 8, you're highlighting $5 billion in
loans and securities that are rolling off. Can you talk about what the repricing uplift is from that? And I think the
message here is that you expect the margin to grind higher because of some of this repricing. The deposit
12

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
repricing opportunities are probably done. So it's more about this asset repricing that's going to drive the margin
higher over time. Is that the right message?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
That's the right message, Jon. And I think the deposits as I think could go a couple of basis points lower, a couple
of basis points higher and quarter-to-quarter, they may change until we see that first rate cut. But we have $4
billion rolling off at 2.25% yield. And you're seeing 6% and 7% yields pretty steadily in the market and some 8% in
our specialty businesses. And so absolutely putting that to work on the client side of the balance sheet versus
parking it in securities or something else is our intention with that money to be able to increase our spread.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope, a question for you on the NII outlook, the DDA attrition a little bit
lower as you guys kind of highlighted in January. Just wondering, what does this guide presume for DDA mix
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. The guide is a 4 basis point range there. So it is assuming today we're assuming kind of flat balances with
non-interest bearing, if we were to see a larger pick-up in that, again, that could help us get to the higher end of
the range. But I don't see any risk to that taking us below the range if we saw immaterial run-off. We think we're at
the bottom, right? We saw some January outflows. February and March are really stabilized. First quarter does
tend to be a little bit more seasonally low and then come back through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, very good. And then just a big picture question on getting ready for the $100 billion in Cat IV, When I
compare you guys versus the Cat IV group, you guys are in pretty good shape. If there is a weak link, it's on the
liquidity side. I'm just wondering, when do you guys start to – I know you have time, but when do you start to
address that and build out the securities book and/or drive down that loan to deposit ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. There's a lot of work going in all around the industry to understand the impact on potential Category IV
banks. Well, as you know, Casey, we've done a lot of work around it. And I think we are in pretty good shape. We
13

have continued to run stress testing. We have some of the infrastructure in place, not all. And we will build that
infrastructure out on the compliance side.
The balance sheet structure issues really fall into two major categories. One, you've highlighted, which is liquidity.
The other is the potential for TLAC. And we don't have a lot of total loss absorbing capital or long-term debt on our
balance sheet either. And in some sense, those two can be mutually solving in the sense that if we raise debt, we
can use that to fund how quality liquid assets.
So, as you said, we have time. We don't feel any particular urgency to start moving the shape of the balance
sheet. Today, we're mindful of those two balance sheet hurdles that we would have to get over. And as we get
greater clarity from the Basel III endgame, the FDIC's proposals around TLAC, we'll have a better sense of the
steps that we need to take over the next two or three years to get prepared for crossing that threshold.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. Just last question for Susan, you mentioned or Hope mentioned a handful of losses within the
CRE bucket on updated appraisals. Just wondering if you could provide some color as to what the price decline
was on those underlying properties.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I mean, on the specific ones, I'd say on average, we saw probably about a 20% decline. I did get in close
contact with our Chief Appraiser just on a larger perspective, Casey, just on what we're seeing in terms of
reappraisals, both on non-performing properties but also just office in general. And it really varies a good bit by
market. Strong markets like in Florida, you're seeing [ph] small turns of (00:39:45) 3% to 5%, 3% to 5%, not 3%.
And then some markets or certain office properties that may have had a major tenant that they haven't yet
replaced, you can see it in the 25% range.
So it is kind of on an individual basis. As it relates to the credits where we took a partial charge related to the new
updated appraisals this quarter, it was in three different markets and one was actually a more of a mixed use
facility. Just that office had less space and so we classify that as office. All three were in our footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And that – so they're – it sounds like most were office, one was a mixed use or was – are these varied by
underlying property type?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Of the $12 million that we took in and charge-offs and commercial real estate, two were pure office and then one
was a mixed use that had some office space, which was the predominant space, but it also had been retail and
multi-family.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
You know, maybe sticking with Casey's question on the CRE. What drove the revaluation? Is that because you
saw individual credit migration? Or is this part of a broader reevaluation of all CRE? And I guess if it's not broader,
what happens to drive a reevaluation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. There are a number of things, Jared, that – first of all, whenever we downgrade loans to non-path, we have
a policy where we do updated appraisals on commercial real estate loans that get downgraded to non-path within
several months of a downgrade. And then as we – if we start to see further deterioration in this case, these were
nonperforming loans, then we'll – in all these three cases, these were, we reappraised six months later, just
having to look at what may be going on.
The other thing that can trigger it is if there's something in an individual loan, it could be the loss of a tenant that
was maybe it was being renegotiated, thought it was going to come up or maybe it's renegotiated a lower rate that
could cause the need for an appraisal. So we believe in being conservative. And if we need to reappraise, like in
this case within six months of the last one, then we'll do that to make sure we've got the valuations correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. So those three loans you talked about, they were previously non-performers and they hit the six month, [ph]
seeded (00:42:51) an additional reappraisal. I guess what happened with that first reappraisal. So if these are
down, call it 20%, what was that first reappraisal step down from maybe peak to current?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Well I guess on those three loans that were previously non-performer, I guess what – you talked about a 20%
mark down now from what I'm assuming is the six month prior reappraisal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
What's the magnitude of sort of origination to current markdown?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Right. So in terms of, I have to look back at that. But again, on average, what we're seeing – and I hate to do
averages because it really does vary by property. So in one case, it was down 20% to 25% from an original
appraisal. But then our charge was not nearly that much because we've got significant equities that we've gotten
these properties when we underwrite them. In other cases, we're seeing appraisals changes of 10%. So it's –
there's a different number for each building.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. That's good color. Thanks. And then maybe shifting to the fixed income business, really good
trends in ADRs this quarter. I guess in a stable rate environment, what's driving the expectation for lower ADRs
going forward? Was that just, you saw some maybe a spurt of activity early on and then it tapered off? Or how
should we be thinking about the pace of that for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Jared, I'll start that. Yes. The first is there was a pent up demand, right. There had not been a lot of balance
sheet repositioning. There had not been a lot of liquidity put to use that we started to see it happen in December
and we had a really good December, which we talked about in our last earnings call, and that just carried through
to Q1. And so we think some of that is behind us and it was more of just kind of a catch up.
Additionally the current week has had given us a little bit of pause in that we are talking about not if we'll see rate
cut, but could we see a rate increase this year? What will it look like? And that has stall, well, will stall that
business for a period of time. And if do you run the current guidance, I know you all do after this call, it assumes
kind of a 500,000-ish ADR for the rest of the year, which is still significantly stronger than we saw last year in
every quarter except for Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then finally, just for me on the buyback strong activity this quarter. Should we be
thinking that you continue being pretty aggressive on that $650 million authorization? Or was there anything
unique in first quarter that may have accelerated some of that?

D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No, we'll continue to be very opportunistic, but we still believe that the stock is and has been on sale and we'll
look for opportunities to manage our excess capital relative that 11% near-term target. And the buyback is a great
vehicle for doing that. In the absence of a significant pick up and balance sheet growth, i.e., loan growth.

Operator: Our next question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Jared's question on the buyback. Bryan, you
mentioned the 11% as the near term. I guess what would lead you to change that directionally, either up or down?
And maybe is there something you could consider this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, right now, I don't think about change in 11% near term. I think there's still enough uncertainty, and the
economy and the interest rate environment that we want to see a few more cards. If anything changed, it would
have to be a significant pickup in the economic environment and inflation abating significantly. And I don't
anticipate either one of those at this point. So we'll manage to the 11% near-term. We'll have greater clarity
probably by the end of this year about what Basel III is likely – the Basel III endgame is likely to look like, and we
can manage from there.
So we're comfortable with that target. And as we pointed out earlier, we start with a 11.3% ratio in CET1. And so
we have a little bit of gap there and we're going to have some earnings. So we think we've got the capacity with
the authorization that we can make a significant dent in that authorization over the next three quarters.

Christopher McGratty Q

Hi, Steve.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Bryan, I wanted to go back to your answer to Casey's question in crossing $100 billion. And I'm curious, given
how this New York community situation played out, how has that impacted how you think about crossing this
threshold? Previously, you said that you thought the transaction was a preferred method. Curious if you still feel
that way.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Well, yeah, that's a – yeah. I guess you have to couple – a couple thoughts. One is, if you put M&A in a separate
bucket, I still have significant reservations about one, what can get approved and two, how long it takes to get it
approved. And so that's not something without greater clarity that looks like a good idea independently. And then
you couple it with crossing the $100 billion threshold and in particular, how much readiness do you have to have?
Is there really a three-year phase in if you cross in the context of an M&A transaction.
I would tell you, while I don't have any inside information, my gut would tell me that what happened recently is
likely to make it more difficult to cross. And I think you'll have to show a significant great – a significantly greater
degree of preparedness to be a Category IV bank or a very near-term path for achieving that. So I think it makes it
– and said another way, it makes it more likely that if you cross the $100 billion threshold in the near term, it's
likely to be in an organic fashion. And then you sort of deal with is M&A, the right strategy, and does it make
sense from a shareholder and a capital deployment perspective independent of trying to cross that threshold?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. If I could shift gears and talk about C&I loan growth. When I look at
balances, they're pretty flat versus prior quarter up a bit versus last year. It's funny, when I look at your markets,
whether it's what's going on in Nashville or Texas or Florida, they're on fire. GDP is probably 4% in your markets.
Why are you not seeing stronger commercial loan growth here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Okay. I'll take part of that, Steven. In terms of C&I loan growth, first of all, we have been focused on making sure
that we're taking care of existing clients first. We're also very focused on full relationship businesses. And as
Bryan said earlier, we continue to remain selective in terms of new underwriting and bringing on new clients. That
being said, we are open for business and we are seeing some good opportunities and have brought in both new
to bank as well as some increased opportunities with existing clients.
And we are hearing when we have pipeline calls, we are hearing some additional opportunities for us to again
lend existing customers but also bring in some generational opportunities in our communities as well as in our
specialty lines of business. So I think that you will continue to see some opportunities for loan growth across our
markets and our business line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
As I pointed out earlier, Steven, there are pockets that are stronger than others and some that are a little softer.
And Susan is exactly right. If you step back, we are looking to build relationships and do relationship banking. And
we really want to move in bank relationships, doing the transaction, lending money, getting it out the door is the
easy part of the business. It's really how you build relationships and the long-term nature of the banking business.
And I think our teams are doing an outstanding job of working for relationship and we've taken some opportunities
where there is not the opportunity for a long term relationship to step away from some transaction. So we're trying
to manage our balance sheet in a way that manages the balance between profitability and growth.

Okay. That's fair. And maybe, Susan, if I could squeeze one more in for you on commercial real estate. I see the
maturity schedule here on the slide. Can you tell us what was the balance of commercial real estate loans that
can you do here in the first quarter? And how did those work out in terms of refinance extensions, things like that?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, in terms of things that came up through, we've had – in terms of things have come up, we have been –
again, as I said earlier, we've had good, really good outcomes in terms of working with borrowers on the
appropriate way to refinance when there is a maturity. It could be the things are clicking along like they should,
then we look at just kind of a traditional renewal, looking at rates and structure. Sometimes we do talk with
borrowers about bringing money to the table either as in terms of a pay down or some reserves.
So again, we're having, I think, really good success. One of the things that I do want to emphasize is that we can
and I mentioned this earlier, we've been very disciplined in our underwriting really through all the cycles. And if
you look at things like our office portfolio, and this is with updated appraisals and our stabilized loan to value on
office is about 60%. So there's a lot of cushion that we have in our commercial real estate book of business. And
that allows us, one, to continue to have good outcomes, but also the ability to work with borrowers, I mean
borrowers have that kind of equity in front of our debt, there's even more of an incentive to work with us.
The last thing I would add is that we've also seen in certain cases where we have been able to – as Bryan talked
about exiting things that aren't relationships. But I would tell you, I'm also still will occasionally see us get
refinanced out of something that might not hurt our feelings, that were being refinanced out of either because of a
credit grade or potentially a borrower that didn't come to the table with quite the right approach that worked for us.
So it's good to see that there are still some opportunities out there too when it doesn't fit our risk profile going
forward, that there are opportunities for them to refinance. So all in all, I feel good about things that have come up
for maturity, our ability to work with them and the options that we have.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
One more for you, Susan, on commercial real estate. Just looking at the allowance build over the last couple of
quarters compared to the coverage ratio on the CRE book, the coverage ratio looks like it's 115% today. That's
been tracking lower. I guess how should we be thinking about the coverage ratio here? And if we don't get any
kind of improvement in rates and we see some broader kind of degradation in that space, are you modeling it to a
coverage ratio or are you modeling it to an allowance ratio? And maybe just give us the puts and takes of those
two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. As it relates to the allowance process, I would tell you that we don't really – we don't shoot for a specific
number. We go through a process, a disciplined process each and every quarter and look at various scenarios
such as different economic outlooks, things that are base case, things that are ultra-stress cases. We don't put a
lot of emphasis on upside cases, but there are those out there as well. And then we have qualitative overlays
related to certain segments that we may decide needs either – that may need more than what just an economic
outlook would look like.
As you know with CECL, CECL is considered a lifetime loss approach. So based on what we know today and
what's external economists and our own internal experts are saying, we believe this is the right reserve coverage
based on several different outcomes that could emerge. But as I mentioned earlier, each quarter, we're re-
evaluating that. And as we all know, things like interest rate outlooks can change pretty dramatically quarter-to-
quarter.
All that being said, I do think the economy – Bryan talked about this, I think the economy remains strong. We're
still seeing borrowers being able to adapt to higher inflation, higher interest rates. But this is something that we
take a look at each and every quarter.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up, looking at slide 22 on the C&I loan buckets, the 12% of C&I, that's to
finance and insurance companies. Can you just give us a reminder what that composition is and maybe more
specifically, what component of that balance is to borrowers that are then using those funds as leverage for
commercial loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So the finance and insurance bucket has a number of different things in it. Probably one of the things our
asset-based lending business, we lend to companies that lend to others. A good part of that is consumer finance
company. And we've been in that business for many, many years. And we've got very sophisticated borrowers. I
would tell you, just as a sidebar, we've also seen them adapt nicely to our interest rate environment as it relates to
how they deploy.
I don't have the exact number with me on how much of it is to then further commercial funds. It's not a big number
for us. We do have some of that kind of business to business type lending arrangement, but it's not a significant
portion of that finance and insurance bucket. So those are the ones I would highlight in that bucket.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I just – so I was curious, I know belabored quite a bit here on the guidance change. It seems like the uptick in
fees, one, it's the big positive. So I think going from 4% to 6%, now 6% to 10%. Should we kind of assume the
expenses are closer to that 6% range, given you've cited fee and fixed income and mortgage, which are typically
higher efficiency ratio businesses? Or can you also see fees at the higher end and expenses on lower? Just kind
of thinking about the cadence of the two throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ben, thanks for the question. I would not say that the expenses will be on the high end. That's a foregone
conclusion. As we mentioned, we are continuing to look at operational efficiencies. We are looking at what is the
right way to run the organization in a lower loan growth environment. We have spent a significant amount on
technology that's going to go into [ph] place (01:02:01) this year, increase additional efficiency. We're looking at
every contract that's coming up and looking at what we're doing on board.
And so our goal would not to be on the end of that, but things can change. But no, I would not make that
assumption. If I thought we were in the high end of that, honestly, I thought it would just increase guidance at the
same time, I told you to be increased revenue and de-risk it.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2024
Got you. Okay. That's fair. And it kind of leads to my next question actually, because I know you're asset
sensitive. You took out a cut in your guidance. To me, it kind of implies that you're closer to the higher end. Like if
we get to the middle of the year, would it even be worth going from plus 1% to 4% to something like 2% to 5%?
Or is that too nuanced to think about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ben, I wish I could. If you saw the number of models we run every single month, and as soon as we get to ALCO
every month, somebody has said something, how overtly something. There's new CPI data which puts it out. And
so I just don't think we're in an environment where we could be that specific, and we thought it was going to be
kind of like our fee income. We knew that the high end of the guidance is probably the low side, and we
immediately let you guys know that we don't expect to come in because there we expect to be it on the high side.
And then we said, previous high side or low side. Forecasting NII in this environment is very, very hard, even
within a 3% range, with as much moving parts as we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Okay, appreciate it. [indiscernible] (01:03:30) I run a one model [indiscernible] (01:03:31) similar number.

Operator: All right. Our next question comes from Brennan Crowley from Baird.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Crowley Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Given fees guide and I know one point last year kind of
2024 positive operating numbers were discussed, and I mean, kind of walk back a bit. And I know it's difficult with
the investment initiative underway here. But given what you've seen through [ph] the three months and the
working (01:05:05) guide today, is that going to be a possibility for this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks for the question, Brennan. I think if you look at where the guide is, it is neutral on operating leverage or
slightly positive depending on which side of the range we come in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So in short, the answer is yes, it's possible.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Crowley Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay Great. Thanks. Yeah. All right, great. Thanks. Thank you, guys. And then just as a quick follow-up and
maybe I missed this in the prepared remarks, but saw that the investment portfolio yield actually fell sequentially.
Just kind of wondering if you could talk about the driver there and then maybe how you guys plan to manage the
portfolio and roll-off over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. First I'll mentioned, we're currently not reinvesting in our securities portfolio, so we're letting it run-off and
redeploying that into the loan side of our balance sheet. But a lot of the volatility that you saw this quarter is just
the mark-to-market and where the market is at the end of the quarter. There was nothing that material change in
our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Crowley Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just wanted to ask one last follow-up on NII. I appreciate you touched on the $4 billion of the fixed rate loan
repricing. Could you give some color on how even that is through 2024? Is it similar to security where it's pretty
much the same every quarter? Or is it a bit more front or back loaded?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, it's pretty consistent through the quarter. There's not a bulge quarter or it being backloaded.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Montgomery Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Sorry for my issue there earlier. Susan, I wanted to ask you about loan modifications and how often they
are a tactic for resolving any type of loan this year and next?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, I mean, any time we have either what if there's a true maturity, we're always looking at what do we need to
do that, that's really kind of a true modification. In terms of modifications, and we have ones that are non-past that
are handled in our special assets groups. There are situations where it might be in our best interest if we're the
lead bank or the [indiscernible] (01:07:47) bank to work with them on modifications.
And then obviously on some of the deals where we're part of a bank group and the bank group has to work
together on what could be an appropriate loan modifications. I would tell you, Chris, that we have a history of
wanting to work with borrowers and figure out the best outcomes that obviously for us are the best outcomes for
our shareholders. But we've also are complimented frequently by our borrowers about our ability to work with
them and in some cases keep them in business.

And as I mentioned earlier, in many cases they've got a lot of equity ahead of us. And so they have a vested
interest in working with us for, to come up with something that makes sense and is economically viable for both
the bank and the client.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The loan modifications used to be an accounting term of ours. And I'll echo what Susan said. I often say this and I
don't say it lightly to our clients. And we look at it as a partnership. And so we use that long term relationship and
we work through the ups and downs. And I don't consider that modification. I just consider that supporting the long
term relationships that really drive out the profitability of our organization and our balance sheet, at the same time
makes our customers and our community stronger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No, that's great. Thank you both for your color on that. And Susan, just a quick follow-up on debt service coverage
ratios. How is the stress process going for customers? Are you seeing instances where you have to criticize a
loan due to just higher interest rates and the DSCR is falling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Chris, I would say that's actually the predominant reason that we're taking loans to special mention and the
initial criticized status, would be that debt service coverage while still over – still able to service the loan. It might
be – it's less than either a covenant or where the borrower expected to be at a certain point in time. And we do
expect, and I mentioned earlier that the downgrades mostly had been into that special mention category. That's a
very dynamic category. And we do see borrowers come back out of it as they adjust either their operating
expenses or its interest rate do start coming down. I expect you'll see a good bit of a lot of upgrades at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you again and best wishes for your success, Susan.
