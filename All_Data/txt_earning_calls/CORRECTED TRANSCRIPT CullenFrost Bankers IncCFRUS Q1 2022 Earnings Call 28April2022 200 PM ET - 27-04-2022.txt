Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I will review the first quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our CFO, Jerry Salinas will provide additional comments and then we're going to open it up for
your questions as a normal practice.
In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $97.4 million or a $1.50 per share compared with earnings of a $113.9
million or a $1.77 a share reported in the same quarter last year and $99.4 million or $1.54 a share in the fourth
quarter of 2021. Our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were 79 basis
points and 9.58%, respectively. And I'm happy with these results to start the year and I'm optimistic about the
prospects for our sustainable organic growth strategy as business activity continues to return to normal and we
move farther into a rising interest rate environment.
Average deposits in the first quarter were $43 billion, that was an increase of more than 21% compared with
$35.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. This is outstanding growth and Jerry will talk more about this growth in
his comments, but I believe at its core it reflects our commitment to strong value propositions, centered around
world-class customer service, investments into our business for both physical expansion and employee
compensation and account features, and also a commitment to a square deal with our customers which is the
basis of any healthy long-term relationship.
Loan growth was also outstanding. Average loans, excluding PPP in the first quarter were $16.1 billion or 8.3%
ahead of the same time last year. On a linked quarter basis, we saw average loans excluding PPP increase over
the fourth quarter and un-annualized 4.5% helping support our expectations for full year average loan growth in

the high-single digits. I'm very pleased with the success of our commercial lending segment. We booked $1.73
billion in new commitments in the first quarter, up 51% from new loan commitments in the first quarter of last year.
The gains were strong in all segments. New commitments booked in the first quarter tend to be seasonally lower
than the fourth quarter and that was true this first quarter as well as we saw first quarter commitments down 29%
from our record monster fourth quarter level. However, our gross new loan opportunities at the end of the first
quarter were up by 29% compared to the fourth quarter and our weighted pipeline at the end of the first quarter
increased by 9% from the fourth quarter, and all this is to say that the outlook for loan growth continues to be
good.
A few other things I found interesting about our lending activity; in the first quarter compared to a year ago, we
looked at 19% more deals, but we booked 42% more deals. That improvement was driven by the C&I component
which went from 29% booking rate last year to a 41% in the first quarter, so we're having more success. We're
seeing more activity from customers as they begin expanding their businesses. So we of course would expect a
higher success rate there. Our advance rate on commercial working capital lines increased from 32.5% at year-
end to 34.8% at the end of the first quarter, still below a more normalized 38% to 40% level. New customer
acquisition continues to be key. Our numbers show that 40% of our linked-quarter growth in outstanding loan
balances came from customers added over the last 12 months.
Our expansion efforts are becoming more accretive to growth. As an example, our year-over-year loan growth of
8.3% would have been 6.8% without the expansion volume. Our consumer business continues to be strong. In
the first quarter, total consumer checking households grew over 7.2% compared to last year which aligns with the
record growth we saw in 2021. Same-store sales for checking accounts increased 17%. Consumer deposits grew
nearly $1 billion in the quarter, giving us a 20% year-over-year increase, and loan demand has picked up on the
consumer side, helping us grow loan balances by a little over 7% year-over-year and helping to set the stage for
the launch of our mortgage product later this year. We believe our value proposition is resonating and we can
continue to grow this business, especially in our expansion markets. In Houston, we see the momentum
continuing to build as the newly opened branches there mature. At the end of the first quarter, we stood at 110%
of our deposit goal, 125% of our new household goal and 181% of our loan goal. And we've had a very successful
start toward Dallas region expansion as well. For the two locations that opened so far this year, along with the
Red Bird Financial Center that opened in 2021, our numbers are early, but they do represent 130% of deposit
goal, 183% of loan goal and 245% of our household goal.
Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to be optimistic about growth in this economy. The third new
location in our 28 branch Dallas expansion project is scheduled to open in second quarter. Additionally, we will
continue to expand in Houston, adding another eight locations over the course of 2022 and 2023. Credit
continues to be good. Total problem loans which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, totaled $447 million at the
end of the first quarter down from $540 million at the end of the previous quarter. During the first quarter, newly
identified outstanding problem loans totaled $14 million. During 2021, the average addition to problem loans was
about $54 million. The increase during the first quarter was one of the smallest in several years. The resolution of
problems via payoffs, payments and upgrades in the first quarter totaled $104 million. The short story here is that
the favorable rate of resolutions continued through the first quarter of 2022.
The March 31 total for delinquency was the lowest in several years. Once again, we did not report a credit loss
expense in the first quarter and our net charge-offs for the first quarter were $6.3 million, and those compared
with $2.8 million in the fourth quarter. Annualized net charge-offs for the first quarter were 16 basis points of
average loans and below our typical long-term level. Non-accrual loans were only $49 million at the end of the
first quarter, a decrease from $53.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. In the first quarter, we
continued making progress toward our goal of a mid-single digit concentration level in the energy portfolio over

time with energy loans representing 6.27% of loans at the end of the quarter, and over the last 12 months, energy
loans are down by 16%. After two years of working with business customers on PPP loans, we're almost across
the finish line with forgiveness complete for 97% of our borrowers.
Putting in the extra effort to help PPP borrowers wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do, and the same goes
for our decision late last year to raise our minimum pay to $20 an hour. Then, in the first quarter, after the Federal
Reserve increased interest rates, we made the decision to pass some of that increase along to our depositors.
Again, it wasn't easy and it wasn't inexpensive but it was the right thing to do for our customers. Steps like these
show our commitment to our communities and being a force for good in people's everyday lives and that's
reflected in the third-party recognition that Frost receives. We learned in the first quarter that once again, and for
the sixth year in a row, we'd received the highest number of Greenwich Excellence and Best Brand Awards of any
bank in the nation. The Greenwich Awards are given for providing superior service, advice and performance to
small business and middle market banking clients. Also, earlier this month, we learned that once again at this
time, it was the 13th year in a row we received the highest ranking and customer satisfaction for J.D. Power US
Retail Banking Satisfaction Study for Texas.
Over the past few years, we've talked to you about all the steps we've taken to enhance our value proposition and
our competitive advantage, things like organic expansion projects, overdraft grace, early payday, state's biggest
ATM network. Keep in mind, this growth has taken place during the pandemic when many of our employees were
working remotely and while our financial centers were taking extraordinary measures to keep people safe. I say
this a lot but I can't say it often enough. I'm so proud of our company and our employees and everything we've
accomplished together. Knowing what our team can do is what makes me so optimistic about Frost's success in
the future.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin. Our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter
was 2.33%, up 2 basis points from the 2.31% reported last quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net
interest margin percentage would have been 2.32% in the first quarter, up 7 basis points from an adjusted 2.25%
for the fourth quarter. The increase was a result of some positive items partially offset by some items with a
negative impact. A lower relative percentage of earning assets held at the Fed down from 34% in the fourth
quarter to 29% in the first quarter as we deployed some liquidity into our investment portfolio had the largest
positive impact. Higher volumes of securities and loans also had a positive impact on the net interest margin
percentage while lower yields on securities and loans had a negative impact. The taxable equivalent loan yield for
the first quarter was 3.74%, down 15 basis points from the previous quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP loans,
the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.73%, down 6 basis points from the prior quarter. And just to
finish up on PPP, as Phil talked about, our total PPP loans at the end of March were only $208 million, down $221
million from $429 million at the end of December. As such, we don't expect PPP to have any material impact on
our 2022 results.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $17.2 billion during the first quarter, up
about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter average as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the
first quarter. We made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately $3.4 billion, which included
about $1.8 billion in agency MBS securities with a yield of about 2.58% and about $1.5 billion in treasuries,
yielding about 1.25%. Included in the $1.5 billion in treasury securities purchased in the first quarter is a $1 billion
purchase of two-year treasuries that we purchased in late-January with a yield of 1.02%. We purchased those

short duration treasuries as a defensive measure given the uncertainty in the market resulting from the potential
invasion at that time of Ukraine by Russia and its potential market implications.
In addition to the $3.4 billion in purchases we made in the investment portfolio in the first quarter, our current
expectation is that we would invest an additional $5 billion of our excess liquidity into investment purchases
through the remainder of the year. The taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was 2.88% in the
first quarter, down 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. The yield on the taxable portfolio, which averaged $9
billion and was up $2.9 billion from the prior quarter, was 1.90% up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter. Our tax
exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $8.2 billion during the first quarter, down about $200 million from the
fourth quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.03%, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. At the end of the
first quarter, 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF-insured. The duration of the investment
portfolio at the end of the first quarter was 5.2 years, up from 4.4 years at the end of the fourth quarter primarily
related to the extended duration on lower coupon mortgage-backed securities.
Average deposits for the quarter were $43 billion, up $7.6 billion or 21% from the first quarter last year. The
growth in noninterest-bearing deposits was up $2.7 billion or 17%, while interest-bearing deposits grew $4.9
billion or 24%. Looking at a 12-month look back of deposit growth, about 32% of our growth over the past year
has come from new relationships. On a linked-quarter basis, deposits are up $1.9 billion or 4.7% on a non-
annualized basis. In the linked-quarter comparison, the growth has come primarily from growth in interest-bearing
deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits in the first quarter was 8 basis points, up 1 basis point from the
previous quarter.
Looking at a couple of linked-quarter income statement comparisons, in noninterest income, regarding insurance,
commissions and fees, all point out to the strong, lean quarter growth of $4.9 million or 42%. Just as a reminder,
the first quarter is always our strongest quarter for insurance commissions and fees due to our natural business
cycle of higher renewals in that quarter and also the impact of contingent commissions that are typically received
in the first quarter. I'll also note that typically the second quarter is our weakest quarter for insurance
commissions.
Looking at linked-quarter total noninterest expenses, I'll note that the first quarter total expenses were right in line
with our projections from one quarter ago. However, given the continued increase in salary pressures in this
current environment, I am increasing our expectation for noninterest expense growth for the full year. Last quarter
I stated that we expected total noninterest expense for 2022 to grow at a high-single digit growth rate over 2021
reported noninterest expense. Given recent activity primarily related to higher than previously projected increases
in salary levels given the competition for talent in this environment, we now expect total noninterest expenses for
the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the low-double digits over 2021 reported levels.
In addition to continued market salary pressures, our projected growth in noninterest expenses is also impacted
by our expansion efforts. The impact of our Houston and Dallas expansions is responsible for about 2% of the
growth, costs associated with reintroducing our residential mortgage product adds about 1%, and increasing our
minimum wage from $15 per hour to $20 per hour in December as a result of salary pressures across the state is
responsible for about 2% of projected growth in noninterest expenses in 2022.
Looking at our effective tax rate, the effective tax rate for the first quarter was 11.3%, and our current expectation
is that our full year effective tax rate should be in the range of 11% to 12%, but that can be affected by discrete
items during the year. Regarding the estimates for full year 2022 earnings, our current projections assumed 50
basis point Fed rate increases in both May and June, followed by 25 basis point Fed rate increases in September

and December. With those rate assumptions and the expected 2022 expense growth that I previously mentioned,
we currently believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates of $7.29 for 2022 is low.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good. So it looks like the amount of securities that you're going to repurchase is clearly higher than, I think, the $7
billion that you talked about last quarter. Obviously, the rate hikes appear to be coming a little bit more intense
and a little faster than expected. Can you just talk about maybe what outside of that maybe is driving that decision
or is that kind of it just higher rates quicker and things like that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I guess one of the things that I did point out was the billion dollars and short-term, the two year treasuries
that we purchased in January, that was really something that we did more as a defensive measure. It really wasn't
part of our original plan. Given that short duration, it'll be back, investable in a couple of years here. And so I kind
of took that $7 billion, I'd say the $8 billion was just an addition, again, given what was going on in the current
environment at that time, and really deposits have been a little bit stronger than we expected. I think I mentioned
in last quarter's call that given some of the past history that we had, I thought the first quarter deposits might be a
little bit softer but they've continued to perform well. I know that when we had the call a quarter ago, our balances
at the Fed were $14 billion. I looked this morning and we're at $13.5 billion. So that gives you a good feel that we

spent quite a bit already and yet we still have a significant amount of liquidity. So, that's a long winded way of
answering your question. Hope I gave you what you needed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you so much. And then the loan growth this quarter obviously very strong. Looks like
you guys are really hitting the stride here, but you reiterated the outlook for growth for the year. To me, it seems a
little conservative. Can you just kind of walk through kind of the puts and takes? So I don't know probably broadly
speaking there's some concern on the economy as we move into the back half of the year but clearly Texas, if
you look at the Moody's expectations for growth over the next couple of years for Texas, it looks very strong. So if
you can just talk about the puts and takes to that outlook. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Michael, first of all, you're right. We do expect it to be – and we do see the outlook is really good. We've got
a good pipeline as I mentioned, which is the opportunity is up 29% from the quarter end at the end of the year.
We are seeing some pay downs or hearing about possibilities of pay downs in the commercial real estate side as
people are concerned about higher cap rates. I don't think we've seen much movement in cap rates yet, but
there's concern there. Obviously, you've seen some higher interest rates. So I think there could be some of that,
but that's probably the biggest headwind. And then also we have been continuing to watch our energy portfolio
and we're almost down to where that mid-single digit number is. I really want to get a five handle on that and I
think probably with good chance sometime during this quarter, I guess, the second quarter to get there. But we're
still being real careful with that. So that's a bit of a headwind and that's what I would say would be the things that
would make it more conservative, but I feel more confident about the high-single digits number that we had talked
about earlier this year.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Good afternoon, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Well, I heard the comments in your prepared remarks about how you guys have already passed along some of
the Fed increase to your depositors. I remember you guys doing this the last tightening cycle as well, but how
much of the initial 25 basis points did you pass along? And then how are you thinking about that as we head into
the Fed continuing to aggressively hike rates from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Brady. So the first hike, I think, that we were about – if you look at interest-bearing, I'd say, in the 28% beta
in that first hike. I think as we look through the rest of the year, and again I guess I should start by saying you've
always heard us talking about the fact that we're going to do what we need to do from a market standpoint. So,
these are current assumptions based on what we saw back in the, I'm going to say, the time period of the – I'm
going to go 2018 to 2019 what we were doing there. And if you recall, we were a little slow. I think as an industry
we waited an hour and we waited until rate had gone up 100 basis points before we moved materially and we said
we didn't want to do that this time. So for that first hike, we're at about a 28%. I'm going to say looking at kind of
where we're going from here is that we'd probably be talking something closer to a 20% beta on them.
And let me read my notes here just to make sure that I'm giving you the right information, but again, I think what
we want to do is we want to make sure that we're consistent with where the market's going to be at that point.
Hold on here – all right. So really we're looking at – on the interest-bearing side, we're looking at something pretty
consistent with that, what we did in the first quarter. So all-in, I'm looking through the rest, most of the hikes that
we have for this year we'd be at about a 30% beta on interest-bearing, 20% overall. When I go back and looked at
what we did between 2016 and 2018, it's pretty comparable to that. So again we'll see what the market does, but
that's what we've got in our current expectations right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then this is, I think your fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of having a zero provision, yeah the
reserve is still roughly 150 basis points. Could it be years until we see a number in that provision line, like you still
have [indiscernible] (00:28:23) reserves, seems like you can bleed down that percentage as you book loan growth
and there just doesn't appear to be much provision need for [indiscernible] (00:28:32), is that the right way to think
about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, what I would say is that if you look at our disclosures in the 10-Ks and the 10-Qs, we've been pretty
descriptive of what we're doing. And what we're finding is that from our standpoint, the models really, truly aren't
reflective of what we see out there. And so, from our analysis, you'll see that a significant part of the reserve need
is based on overlays to those models. This quarter given some of the considerations and concerns about a
potential recession, even that sort of a discussion was really what was tainting, what was going on in our minds
as we finalized our allowance calculation. I guess what I'd say is when I look at our projected loan growth that Phil
kind of quoted there, I look at the credit quality that we've got and knock on wood, Bill Perotti, our Chief Credit

Officer keep saying it can't be any better, but it continues to be really good. And so as I look at projected loan
growth, if there's not a whole lot of changes in the environment that we're operating in, I think that having a
provision at no provision or minimal provision is kind of probably where we'd I'd be thinking for the full year, but
there's a lot of ifs out there, but again everything looks so good.
Loan growth is – it's at a high-single digits in my mind isn't unreasonable. Phil was talking about 20% loan growth
or something like that. I'd be answering that question differently, but basically looking at where our projections are,
the sort of asset quality we have, what we're seeing in the outlook from a projection standpoint. Again, it's going to
all come down to what the models say and what our analysis says at the end of each quarter. But where I sit right
now, it's hard, as you said, looking back for the last few quarters and not seeing a whole lot of provision. Yeah. It's
kind of hard to figure that there'd be much of a provision going forward through the next couple of quarters; all
things being equal.

Please proceed with your questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on loan growth. And just in terms of the outlook maybe, Phil. I
guess when you think about the back half of the year, the concern obviously is Fed hikes and what implications it
carries for customers both businesses and consumers and their ability to absorb that. Just talk to us as you deal
with your customers and what you're hearing from them in terms of what a Fed fund at 3% means. Is it enough to
really hurt demand and potentially push the economy into a recession? Would love to hear your thoughts.

Ebrahim, we're not seeing a lot of impact at this point. We are doing a lot with our officers to really sensitize them
about the impact that inflation can have on businesses. Some of us older guys, we know what it's like back when
Volcker was doing his thing, shutting things down. But most people, I'd say, most lenders in the financial services
industry haven't been through a period of any meaningful inflation, and so we're doing our job to help our people
understand how to contact and ask questions and understand the impact that inflation could have on a business
and for us to understand that. That said, we haven't seen that impact to this point. I think that the most direct
impact would probably be in the commercial real estate just in terms of viability of projects. We haven't seen a big
impact on that at this point. But if you look at actual real rates, I think, are still pretty negative. So Fed's got a way
to go given inflation and other things to tighten things up and slow things down. So right now, I'm not seeing too
much of it, except as it relates to worry in the commercial real estate area.

Got it. And I guess one question for you, Jerry. I'm sorry if I missed it, but remind us in terms of your outlook for
deposit growth from your – just do you expect any outflows as rates move higher? I know you talked about just
the deposit betas and your thought process there. But what do you think about deposit growth? And any

perspective you can share in what you think spread revenue growth could look like given the rate assumptions
that you outlined earlier?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. We did – if you look at our numbers, we can see that commercial DDA is softer. It's still growing but
it's not growing at the pace that we've seen. To me, I think that's still a positive. I'll say back in the previous cycle,
we really didn't see a whole lot of movement for the first 100 basis points. I'm going to say that we're much more
aware and much more sensitive to what's going on, and certainly try to be as reactive as we can. I think that
deposits – I think we're still projecting growth. I don't think we'd be foolish to project a 20% growth year-over-year
although I probably said that last year when we still had 20%. But I do think that our current projections, based on
what we're seeing with the growth that we're getting from new customers and the success that we've had with our
expansion, I still expect that we'll see some upside this year. I don't expect that it'll be in the double digits, but I
think that we've got a good opportunity to be at least high-single digit deposit growth as we move forward and
we're going to be competitive on rates as you've heard us say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And any sense on what spread revenue growth could look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think we talked a little bit about in the quarter – last year's quarter that on a TE basis, full year growth, I
think it'd be in the – higher than the mid-teens but not 20%, sort of range is kind of what I'm thinking given on our
current assumptions with the rate hikes. Obviously, the December hike doesn't do much for us at all, but you
know I think that's kind of what we're seeing right now. Obviously, we don't have – the only thing I guess I'd want
to be sensitive to is that let me make sure that PPP was such a big piece of our financials. We did such a – our
team did such a great job in getting those PPP loans booked and now forgiven, but now I think I'm pretty
comfortable with that number. It'd be something some – at least based on our current projections and our current
betas, it'd be something north of the mid-teens. Does that help?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. Good afternoon. Hi. How are you? Just wondering if you could talk to us about what you're thinking in terms
of future branch expansion after 2023. Do you think you could go back and do more in Houston and Dallas before
proceed on to Austin; any thoughts there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, Jennifer, I think we'll be – we'll probably have a little bit left to do in Dallas on follow on in 2024. So
we'll do some of that. And we could just like we had Houston 2.0 where we came back with about another third of
the new locations for new branches there; we could see some expansion in Dallas three years from now. I really
believe this is going to be an ongoing activity for us as we develop these markets like Houston and Dallas. And I
keep saying the thing that it's so amazing about those two markets is each one of them is 50% larger in deposits
than either the state of Arizona or the state of Colorado, so these are massive markets.
Just another thing that's I think that's interesting; if you look at our farthest northwest location, Houston to our
farther as southeast, I think it's the same distances between San Antonio and Austin. So, that's a big city.
Obviously, Austin has got some opportunity there and I think that we'll be looking at that over time, but Jennifer
one thing that – it might seem like a little deal to you, but this is something I saw just yesterday that I am really
excited about, and this is a branch location that we opened in San Antonio. Now, it's in a good growth market that
we really hadn't been in for various reasons. It's on the west side of San Antonio. It's called Alamo Ranch. And
that branch opened around Thanksgiving. Okay. So it's been open about four months. A lot of those months,
really bad months for banking in terms of opening up accounts, but looking at those numbers in four months,
we've got $17 million in deposits and we have 603 new relationships in four months. This is a market we've got
25%, 27% market share.
Let me put that in perspective. I'll say, well tell me what was the best branch we had in Houston, and we said, well
it's got to be Cinco Ranch in Katy in terms of speed of growth. So I'll compare that to Cinco Ranch and Cinco
Ranch after four months had $3.5 million in deposits in comparison to $17 million of San Antonio location. It had
180 households compared to 603 in San Antonio. I mean, what that tells me is that; man, you picked the right
markets with the right brand recognition, with our value proposition and our ways of engaging that market, we're
going to be successful. And look it's not because we hired Mr. Alamo Ranch in terms of new to the market,
brought all the business. As I recall, the person we hired to run it is from Kansas City. So man, this was really
encouraging, and I think it's instructive for us about the value of putting properly placed, properly managed new
locations around the state. So I really believe this, Jennifer that the best two words I can say about our organic
growth strategy is that it is durable and it's scalable. I really believe that we're going to be doing this for a long
time.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Steve.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Jerry, I was hoping you could help out with this. So, if we look at the yield that you called out on the taxable and
tax exempt securities, as the interest rates rise can you help us think about a securities beta, if you will or how
responsive should those be? I'm assuming it's probably three-year to five-year part of the curve we should be
looking at for both of those [indiscernible] (00:41:47) for the munis. But how responsive, if you look at cash flows
coming off due reinvestment rates, how should we think about those resetting as interest rates move higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, let me help you a little bit with kind of what we're thinking about with the $5 billion that I said we still have to
purchase. And you're right. I mean, right now what we're thinking is that about 70% of that is going to be in
treasuries and we're thinking that it would be five years and shorter is what we're doing, and so that really only
leaves another 15% in mortgage backs and another 15% in munis. I guess, if you looked at the five-year today,
we're at [ph] 288 (00:42:34). I think we were this morning. I mean, I'm trying to look here what we've got rolling off.
I think that, the kind of comparison I would make is more the fact that because we're really increasing the portfolio
from the standpoint of using our excess liquidity, 2022 is really not a significant year for our projected muni calls
or maturities, and so I think mostly the what we'll be doing is we'll be reinvesting primarily out of our excess
liquidity. So in a lot of ways, whatever assumption you make on what we're investing is going to be a pretty
significant hiccup. Now if I look at kind of some of the calls – I'm trying to see if I got some of that information here
with me. For the first quarter, we really didn't have a whole lot coming off. I think we had just $300 million, and
most of those tended to be munis, and I think the blended rate there was a 3.55%.
As I look at kind of what we're going to see through the rest of the year, I don't see any really significant maturities
that I would feel that we would want to call out. I mean, I think our current projections, for example, August and
February are the big calls on our muni portfolios. And both of those are less than – they're in the $200 million to
$300 million in each of those time periods. So from a maturities, if you include prepayments in there, again I
mean, we're just not – I'm looking at a 12-month forward. So I got a little bit of 2022 and a little bit of 2023
included here, but it's only a $1.7 billion and that's combined both maturities and prepayments. So, in a lot of
ways I think a lot of it's going to be good upside that we're picking up, investing out of balances that are at the
Fed.

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Now, I think if we put anything on, it's going to be – especially in the near term, it's probably going to be – if you
are replacing security, it's going to be at a lower yield in today's environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Against what we've got on the books.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then so if we looked at all of the liquidity you're sitting on today, do they get to a certain point like
okay, like we can go back to where we used to be in terms of cash to assets ratio, which was I guess about a third
of where you are now or is there some reason that from structure where you'd need to hold more liquidity than in
the past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I don't think so. There's a – in some ways, I would argue that we have more access to funding if we needed it
than we've in the past. So, no I don't see any sort of structural reason that we want to invest. What you'll see us
doing as we go through the rest of 2022 and what I would expect through 2023 is a much more averaging sort of
a dollar – dollar cost averaging, if you will, purchases. We're going to try to avoid making any significant
purchases. Now, if for some reason we saw something really unusual happen in the market, might we jump in and
do something? We might. But I think right now what we're projecting is that we're projecting that it's going to be a
– we're expecting rates are going to go up, and so we're just going to continue to – over the next year – for the
rest of the year, let's say, for the next nine months, we're just going to make some ratable purchases each month
expecting that we're never going to be able to time the market exactly, but if we kind of make purchases during
the remaining months, we're going to catch some good bounces there and we may miss one like we did in the
case of the two-year that we bought at 1%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So we're just going to average it in. And I would expect that's what we would do as we get into to 2023. A lot of it's
going to be dependent on what happens with deposits, right? We've been really fortunate, like I said. When we
look at the balances at the Fed, we're making a lot of investment purchases, but at the same time, that balance
doesn't really seem to move a lot. So we've been fortunate there. And obviously if that continues, we might find

ourselves in a position where we'd be willing to invest more, but we're not looking to invest all our dry powder in
2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then the final one, going back to Ebrahim's question on deposit growth, loan-to-deposit ratio is fairly
low but you've always new markets and initiatives really driving those deposit growth. Should we think the loan-to-
deposit ratio could stay fairly stable at these levels or should we be thinking that loan growth is faster than deposit
growth so that trends lower, say, through 2022, 2023? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
You know, I think that – and I'll let Phil give us thoughts on it. The challenge is that we've got such a big base of
deposits and we've been so fortunate to be able to grow that base with the top quality service that our employees
are providing, the fair pricing that we're giving. And so when deposits are more than twice the size of our loan
book, if they're growing at that – even if they grew at 6% and the loans grew at the high-single digit, it's going to
be a while before we make a significant dent on that ratio and we certainly love deposits, we love the relationships
that come with them. We think that a lot of our success is based on our core funding, so that's my thoughts. So I'll
turn to Phil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the math of it is going to be we're going to have a low loan-to-deposit ratio for some time, but I'd
also say that that's a high class problem. And I think the more important thing is the company growing, right. And
so I think it'll take a while to eat into that ratio. The other thing I'll say about growing deposits is we have such a
high level of transaction accounts because of our relational business model, like I think it will probably – I don't
know 60%, maybe almost two-thirds or transaction accounts if you look at consumer checking accounts and
commercial checking accounts, at any kind of normalization of interest rates, let's say, a 2% Fed funds rate, for
example. I mean, the spread that you make on those deposits being in liquidity is what you might make on some
old LIBOR based loans. I mean, they're nothing to sneeze at some point when your interest rates are moving. So
I'm feeling very, very comfortable about the fact that yeah we're probably going to have a fairly low loan to deposit
ratio or certainly lower than peer for a pretty good period of time.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Steve Alexopoulos is a smart guy. That was the question I had for you but I do have a couple others. Just Phil,
you usually give us some color on the competitive environment in terms of loans that you passed on due to
structure and pricing. Could you just give us a 30,000 foot view on what the environment's like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think the environment gets a little bit worse every quarter. I think that it continues to show up in commercial real
estate where people are struggling to underwrite in a market where prices are increasing so fast and where most
of us have these sensitized analyses that, okay, well will your project cash flow x percent based upon x percent
interest rate? Those are harder to justify. They're harder to underwrite. It's hard to underwrite well how much rent
growth are you willing to underwrite into deals, okay. That's an important factor when prices are going up like they
are. I think people are asking for longer-terms at the front end and they're looking for ways to extend what really
not much required of them. And that's – I mean, I'm not telling you anything you don't know. I mean all this stuff is
just what's out there in the marketplace. I think some people are – we're seeing maybe a little bit of a trend to
people underwriting to a debt yield, and whereas you might have underwritten to a 10% debt yield, maybe they're
backing off that number, maybe you'd seen 8% number. I think there's just creativity being utilized by underwriters
in the market to justify and bring deals across the line. I'm sure that's not exhaustive, but it's just an example of
some of the things we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. Question on your mortgage expectations; just I don't know a couple of quarters ago you talked about
it and it just seem like more of a rifle shot approach. But I was just thinking of your Alamo Ranch example and
some of the consumer checking account growth that you're seeing. Any change in the expectations there and kind
of what are your expectations for the mortgage contribution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think you make an excellent point, Jon. I mean it's one of the things we're talking about. I mean, just take that
example. I think our loans they're like, I don't know, a $1.5 million, which is not bad in four months, and you look
at what is in this case. It is a more consumer-oriented, more of a house style location, whereas we typically tend
to go to a more – where you've got a lot more concentration of businesses and such in a more wheelhouse, but I
think that the addition of the mortgage product into our product mix, into some of these markets like this one here

and there're tons of these I think, around the state, it makes it more viable from generation of assets, and so I
think it helps us net-net in terms of the viability of locations that we can go into.
And remember we're not approaching this as a refinance strategy on mortgages. We are looking to do deals
where your – their purchased money mortgage is and where we can provide great service and help customers
with a significant financial transaction in their lives. So, I think we're going to have to see. We're not going to be
offering our first one until later this year like I'd say fourth quarter sometime, but I'm really optimistic on the quality
experience we're going to give and how successful we're going to be with that asset class over time. And I just
can't wait to get after this market; no, in a prudent way, of course. But get after this market with that customer
experience, I think it's going to be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I just think through that as it's maybe one solution, your loan-to-deposit question, and if you'd
portfolio some of this, and you've seen some peer banks do that as well, but ...

Okay, okay. Just last one, non-quantitative, but how do you think the Frost brand resonates with new residents?
Is this market share you're taking from other banks and taxes from existing people or do you feel like the brand
resonates with somebody we hear about people moving from California to Texas, is that part of this growth as
well? Thanks.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I can't tell you that I have definitive information on what our penetration is for Californians or people from
Illinois or in the Texas. Here's what I think, though. Our growth numbers have been so good, say, on the
consumer side that I think that we're having good success. I mean, the way most people shop, our research says,
you're going to go into a market, you might just stay with your own look – your own old bank, but you're going to

still look to see where the nearest branch location is, that our research shows that's still the number one factor
someone considers.
And then, you're going to look online at what kind of reputation and those kind of things, and you're going to do
your research. And if you do that, I mean, our numbers – we're just going to be in the game. In fact, obviously,
with our customer service numbers, I think that we'll be ahead of the pack most of the time. And there's so much
in-migration into these cities and our growth is good that it just tells me that I think what we're doing resonates
with a fair number of people that are moving in. And the thing is, we're of a size, we don't have to get everyone,
we just got to get our share plus on that and we'll do really well.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon, Phil and Jerry. I just wanted to follow up on some of your comments around the
deposit franchise and the strength of the deposit base. And in particular, some have raised the concept of surge
deposits and the possibility that there could be some outflow as the fed starts to drain liquidity from the system. It
sounds like you think your deposits are sticky, and that's not something that you're worried about, but perhaps, if
you could just frame how you think about that? And lastly, if I could squeeze in, you mentioned that consensus
EPS looks low, but I was hoping you could perhaps share your thoughts on what you think about consensus, net
interest income, growth expectations, does that also look like it's perhaps a bit late? I would appreciate your
thoughts. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you. Well, I'll just say that with regard to deposits and what the levels are, I mean, I think what you're
hearing us, and what you're hearing Jerry say is, we're careful and conservative. We expect these growth rates
are going to slow. We've been growing at 20% for, gosh, I think the last two years, and we think they'll slow. Do
we still see augmentation in our deposit balances as opposed to new customers? Yeah, probably. What is it,
Jerry, about augmentations, what?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah, 68%. So, call it, two-thirds of our growth is augmentation right now based on the last quarter. Third from
new customers. We could see some drop – and if we see diminishment of account balances, we could see some
drop on that. But my gut tells me, and we saw this back in 1999 whenever the fed reacted to the tech bubble and
pushed rates down too low, you could see deposits flatten. But I think, once they do, they probably reach, what I'll
call, dynamic equilibrium, where you've got maybe deposit balance for current customers diminishing, but you're
still bringing on that account growth that we're showing and what we're reporting on. We've got these expansions.
So, I tend to think it would be more of a flattening than an absolute reduction of surge deposits, as you call. But
hope is not a plan. And I'll tell you that one part of the reason we have that $13 billion in liquidity there is, because
you provide for those kinds of eventualities. So, we are prepared, regardless of which way it goes.
I'll let Jerry speak to the margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think the number that I see out there that A.B. is sharing with me, is $1.50 billion, $1.49 billion, something
like that, is kind of where it looks like consensus to that. And I'll go back to – and what I don't know is whether
that's a TE number or not. I will say that if it's a TE number, the guidance I gave would infer a higher number than
that one is concerned. If I look at – trying to see if I've got the non-TE number. Yeah, even, if it's a non-TE
number, I'd say that, yeah, I mean, it's in the ballpark of little, what I would say, maybe a little shy of where we're
at. But again, I'm just – that's, I'm going off $1.49 billion number. Our projections, obviously, on a TE basis is
much higher than that on a non-TE basis, still higher, but we're certainly within the range.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just back on the NII discussion. Appreciate the update there and your thoughts that
you just talked about in terms of what you're seeing versus consensus. I guess, when I take a step back and you
talked about maybe things should be a little bit stronger than your prior guide, which is mid-teens, back in
January, you guys were only factoring in 25-basis-point hike in May, July, and December. And now, we're talking
50 basis points and 50 basis points in 2Q alone, it just seems like the updated guide is still conservative,
especially just given the message on deposit betas as well which I think improved from your prior thoughts in
January as well. So it just seems like is it a case of maybe you're factoring in a little conservative admin here, or it
feels like 20% plus might be more in the ballpark of what you're looking at, any updated thoughts there?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. I think that part of the discussion is going to be the betas that come in, especially on the hikes after
hopefully this May hike. I think that's some of it. I think also the assumption, what gets assumed on investment
purchases going forward, right, and the timing of those, I think a lot of it's just going to be dependent on timing
and what assumptions you make on the rates that we'll be purchasing at on the investment securities...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...because that's going to be a big part of the driver here. We are probably a little conservative on deposit betas as
well. We want to ensure that we do what we say we're going to do which is, make sure that we are competitive in
the marketplace against all the peers, not just the too big to fail. So, I think there is probably some of that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
There's going to be – there'll be some pressure on loan pricing as well. I mean, we did see a drop on a linked
quarter as well. So, we'll feel some of that as well. But, I mean, I think I've given you about all the color that I can
give you, and I think a lot of it's just going to be dependent on your assumptions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. I appreciate that. And the $5 billion in securities purchases you were talking about, that's purchases, not
growth, right? So, you're expecting maybe another $3 billion or $4 billion in securities growth for the rest of the
year, is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, that'd be fair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. So that $5 billion is just purchases.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Got you. All right. Maybe if I can just sneak in one more. I was just curious to, you guys gave some pretty positive
color on the percentage of your goals that you're achieving in Houston, Dallas, so just curious because Houston's
been around for a while now, can you just update us on what the loan-to-deposit balances look like in terms of
dollars? That'd be great. Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Okay. Give us a sec. And one thing I'll say about Dallas that, even though it's early, it's running about two-thirds
commercial on the deposit side, one-third consumer. So, I think it's uncanny how the character of the business
that we're generating in the Dallas market is consistent with Houston.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And so, looking at the loan-to-deposit ratio, you were asking for the expansion, that's running about a 71%
right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Well, in terms of the dollar amounts of loans and deposits you have in Houston?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. Of just the expansion branches is all I'm sharing with you. Kind of what we've...

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Oh, okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Well, I was just curious how much in the way of loans and deposits you have in Houston now...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...Sure. Yeah. So, we had deposits of $725 million, call it, and loans of a little bit shy of $515 million.

proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks. [ph] I hate to beat this to a dead horse (01:07:05), this net interest income. If I could try it one more time,
Jerry, the guidance that you gave north of mid-teens, is that on a reported basis of 2020 or does not exclude PPP
income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, that's – so the guidance I'm giving is, TE, net interest income full year 2022 just reported over full year 2021.
And you're right, 2021 does include quite a bit more PPP than we've got. So, I'm saying that we'd have a little bit
north of mid-teen growth is what we're projecting currently over the reported 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
On a reported basis. Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then overdraft and NSF fees have become a hot topic for the banks, and you've seen a
number of banks [indiscernible] (01:08:05). I'm just curious what your thoughts are on overdraft, NSF fees, and
how much that is on a quarterly basis for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. The things that we're talking about now is, we implemented, I think, Phil may have mentioned in his
comments, overdraft grace in April, I think it was of last year, which basically...

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...allows customers that have at least $500 in direct deposit to be able to incur a $100 overdraft with no fee. The
current conversation that we're having is that we would expand that to include all consumer customers, so even if
you didn't have a direct deposit. And that probably cost us about $2 million a year when we pull that trigger which
will be sometime later this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Jerry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think the other thing, Peter is, we continue to monitor that program and just we've been doing it for years. I think
the other thing that's becoming mainstream is elimination of, what's called, NSF fees. And yeah, we're in the
middle of working towards that. It's just a systems programming issue which you've got to put in place. And I
expect us to have that done in the next few months.
And, Jerry, [indiscernible] (01:09:42)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. That's probably somewhere around $350,000 to $400,000 a quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Jerry Salinas A

But all those are considered in my guidance.
