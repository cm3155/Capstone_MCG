over to Bryan McKeag, our Chief Financial Officer to provide additional information around HTLF's results. Also
joining us today is Nathan Jones, our Chief Credit Officer, who can answer any questions regarding our credit
quality, which is quite strong.
HTLF had continued success and growth in the first quarter, reporting $47.9 million of net income and EPS of
$1.12. Our ongoing growth strategy and investments in talent and technology continue to deliver results with
strong growth in loans, deposits and revenue and excellent credit quality. I'm pleased to share with you our solid
results.
In the first quarter, we delivered organic loan growth of $358 million or 4% from the linked quarter, excluding PPP
and significantly exceeding our guidance of $200 million. Deposit growth of $249 million from the linked quarter,
total revenue of $169 million, in line with our expectations and excellent credit quality with non-performing assets
decreasing to 32 basis points of total assets.
Let's start with loan growth highlights. We saw continued strength across our diversified commercial loan
portfolios. From the linked quarter, commercial and industrial increased $174 million or 7%, owner-occupied real
estate increased $26 million or 1%, non-owner-occupied real estate increased $151 million or 8%, construction
decreased $14 million or 2%, and our ag portfolio increased $13 million or 2%. In the first quarter, we added 322
new commercial relationships, representing $263 million in funded loans and $58 million of new deposits. We had
growth across all segments, banks, food and agribusiness, and HTLF's specialized industries.
Our teams are well-positioned with strong customer relationships and a robust pipeline of prospects. Our
commercial pipeline remains strong at over $2 billion as it has for the last three quarters. And we expect to grow
commercial loans by more than $250 million in the second quarter.
I spend a considerable amount of time talking to our customers, getting to know their businesses and outlooks.
While there are headwinds such as inflation, supply chain and staffing, our customers are cautiously optimistic for
the rest of this year.
In our consumer loan portfolio, we saw growth of $12 million or 3% from the linked quarter. Residential mortgage
decreased $4 million or less than 1% from the linked quarter. We delivered another quarter of deposit growth.
Non-time deposits totaled $15.6 billion, an increase of $219 million or 1% from the linked quarter. Total deposits
grew to a record $16.7 billion, an increase of $249 million from the linked quarter. This marks our 12th
consecutive quarter of total deposit growth.
We maintained our exceptional deposit mix. 94% of deposits are in non-time accounts, 38% of deposits are in
non-interest-bearing accounts, positioning us well in a rising rate environment. Our deposit pricing strategy
continues to serve us well. Total deposit costs remain low at 7 basis points, a decrease from 12 basis points a
year ago. Total assets are $19.2 billion, an increase of $995 million from a year ago. Assets decreased slightly by
$35 million or less than 1% from the linked quarter.
Turning to key credit metrics, we've added talent and strategically build a strong credit team that uses a
disciplined credit approach. The team has been focusing on improving credit quality across our portfolios. Non-
performing loans represented 58 basis points of total loans at the end of the first quarter, a decrease of 12 basis
points from the linked quarter. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets declined to 32 basis points
from 37 basis points in the linked quarter. Delinquency ratio remains near our historic low at 10 basis points. Non-
pass rated loans decreased to 6.3% from 7.4% in the linked quarter.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Lastly, in the first quarter, we reported net charge-offs of $3 million or 12 basis points annualized of average
loans. This was largely related to one Ag credit we've been working to bring to resolution for several years.
I'd like to congratulate John Schmidt on being named our new independent board chair. John has served as a
Director since 2001 and brings deep experience and understanding to the role, having previously served at HTLF
as a Bank President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. John and the board share HTLF's vision
to be a top-performing and admired banking organization. And we are delivering against our ambitious and
disciplined growth strategies, which were developed by our management team and unanimously approved by the
HTLF Board of Directors.
These strategies are working. We are achieving growth by retaining and attracting top talent such as our HTLF
Food & Agribusiness team, adding customer relationships demonstrated by the last four quarters of 15%
commercial and ag-related loan growth, excluding PPP, expanding into adjacent growth markets, which we've
done in Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, St. Paul, and the western suburbs of Chicago. We will also achieve growth by
consolidating our 11 separate bank charters into a single HTLF bank charter. This will create operational and cost
efficiencies and unlock capacity that supports growth both organically and through M&A.
Charter consolidation isn't a goal in and of itself. It's one of several strategies to achieve our goals of organic
growth and growth through acquisitions. We can grow organically, pursue charter consolidation and potential
M&A strategies simultaneously. Internal efficiency and external growth are complementary, not contradictory.
Our 11 bank divisions will maintain their brands, local leadership and local decision making, staying focused on
customers and relationships and HTLF will maintain our strong and sizable presence in Dubuque, Iowa.
While expenses were elevated in the first quarter, we expect them to improve in the second quarter. Bryan will
provide more details on expenses in his comments. We expect to complete charter consolidation by late 2023 and
deliver $20 million of annual savings. We also continue to optimize our branch network. This year, we plan to
close or sell a total of 11 branches or 8% of our branch network. HTLF has considerable momentum and is
positioned for continued growth in progress against our goals of organic loan growth, new customer acquisition,
attracting and retaining talent, controlling expenses and maintaining strong credit quality.
We are driving growth and creating value for our employees, customers and shareholders. Our strategy and
accomplishments have been recognized by Forbes as one of America's Best Banks for 2022. HTLF ranked 28th,
our highest ranking to-date. It's the sixth consecutive year we've been ranked by Forbes based on profitability,
growth, credit quality, and efficiency. Our strategic investments in technology are delivering best-in-class services
and technology to our customers.
Earlier this month, we began introducing an update to consumer and commercial online banking experiences. In
June, we launched Zelle, enabling consumers – consumer customers to make fast, safe and easy person-to-
person payments.
I specifically want to recognize our employees and thank them for their continued commitment to delivering
strength, insight and growth to our customers, communities and investors. I am grateful for their hard work and
dedication that have strengthened our company. Together, we are HTLF.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials. Bryan?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing our earnings release, which details another
solid quarter for HTLF, with earnings per share reported at $1.12, loan growth of $358 million, excluding PPP, and
continued improvement in credit metrics.
But before I go into more detail, I would remind you – remind everyone that you can find additional information on
the quarter in our first quarter investor presentation, which is available in the IR section of HTLF's website.
So I'll start my comments, as I usually do, with the provision for credit losses, which was a $5.7 million benefit this
quarter, which is slightly better than the $5.3 million benefit last quarter, as underlying credit trends remain very
favorable, highlighted by non-performing loans, which declined by $11 million, and loan delinquencies that
remained near historic lows at 10 basis points of total loans. As Bruce mentioned, net charge-offs were $3 million
this quarter, due primarily to one ag-related credit that's been in our workout group going through bankruptcy for
several years. A good portion of the charge-off had been reserved for in prior quarters.
The economic outlooks used to develop the allowance were upgraded from last quarter, but still retain a measure
of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for what it views as lingering economic
headwinds. So at the end of the quarter, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both
the allowance for credit, losses on loans and unfunded commitments, stood at $116.8 million or 1.15% of total
loans. In addition, at quarter end, unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled $16.3
million or 16 basis points of total loans.
Moving on to some other balance sheet items, investment balances declined $508 million this quarter, which
includes a $381 million or about 5% reduction in fair market value. Investments now comprised 37% of assets
with a tax equivalent yield of 2.16%, a modified duration of just over 5 years, and generate between $70 million
and $75 million of average cash flow per month.
Tangible common equity ratio decreased 129 basis points to 6.55% at the end of the quarter, and reflects a 147
basis points decline that was primarily due to the decrease in market value of investments, and was partially
offset by an 18 basis points increase from higher retained earnings. HTLF's regulatory capital ratios remain
strong, with Common Equity Tier 1 at just over 11.5% and total risk-based capital at 15.7%. So, the balance sheet
continues to be very strong and well-positioned.
Moving to the income statement, and starting with revenue, non-interest income – or net interest income totaled
$134.7 million this quarter, which was $2.5 million lower than the prior quarter. The main drivers of the reduction
were, first, a $3.8 million decline in PPP interest and fees recognized this quarter at $4.3 million, down from $8.1
million last quarter. We exited the quarter with $2.4 million of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on our books.
And second, due to the first quarter having two fewer days than the prior quarter, net interest income was $3.1
million lower. In total, these two items resulted in a $6.9 million decrease in net interest income compared to the
prior quarter. Excluding these components, net interest income would have been $4.4 million higher than last
quarter.
The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis remained unchanged this quarter at 3.12%. As expected,
investment yields improved 22 basis points. In addition, loan yields fell 20 basis points and interest cost declined
1 basis point. This quarter, the net interest margin includes 5 basis points of purchase accounting accretion,
which was unchanged from the prior quarter.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Non-interest income increased this quarter to $34.6 million. Excluding security gains and losses, core non-interest
income was $32 million, up almost $1 million from the prior quarter, and as strong commercial swaps and
syndication fees more than offset some weakness in wealth management and mortgage banking revenues in
relation to rising interest rates. So core revenue trends were positive for both net interest income and fees, and
we believe revenue can continue to trend positive throughout the rest of 2022.
Shifting then to expenses, non-interest expenses totaled $110.8 million this quarter. That's down $4.6 million from
last quarter. Excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, core expenses decreased $1
million to $110 million compared to $111 million last quarter. And as Bruce said, unfortunately, they're a little bit
higher than we had projected last quarter. This miss was primarily in salary and benefits expense, which
increased $3 million due to higher incentive and benefit accruals that we set in Q1. However, these accruals are
expected to normalize at lower levels as we go forward.
On the positive side, FTE counts declined by 41 late in the quarter, and we anticipate additional reductions next
quarter as we work through initial charter consolidation opportunities. Offsetting the increases in personnel costs
or declines in professional fees, advertising and other expenses, which were lower due to IT and other projects
winding down, as we approach our initial charter consolidations.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we believe HTLF will continue to deliver strong results, highlighted by
loan pipelines, which, as Bruce noted, remains strong, and support our expected loan growth rate, ex-PPP, of 2%
to 3% per quarter. Non-time deposit growth is likely to slow into the 1% range per quarter.
Assuming no additional fed rate changes, net interest income, excluding PPP, is projected to grow in the single
low – low-single digits on a percentage basis per quarter, as loan growth will improve earning asset mix and
increase earning assets. In addition then, the anticipated increase of 50 basis points by the Fed in May is
projected to increase net interest income by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. Provision for credit
losses are expected to begin to normalize with continued loan growth, and net charge-offs are expected to remain
below historical levels for the rest of 2022.
Non-interest income, excluding investment gains and losses, in total is expected to be flat at about $32 million per
quarter, with higher commercial deposits, swaps and syndication fees, offsetting lower mortgage banking and
wealth management revenue.
Core expenses are expected to decline $2 million to $3 million into the $107 million to $108 million range next
quarter. We expect modest declines in subsequent quarters as we manage core expenses lower by rationalizing
branches, slowing IT and other spending, and realizing additional cost saves as we move through charter
consolidations in the back half of 2022. However, persistent inflationary pressures, particularly wage inflation,
remain a difficult headwind.
Charter consolidation restructuring costs will ramp up in the coming quarters. We still estimate $17 million of
remaining costs over the next two years. Consolidation will reduce run rate costs and create operating leverage
for future growth. These benefits will layer in over the next two years, and we are confident that in total, they will
reach the $20 million mark on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed. And finally, we believe
core tax rate of 22% to 23%, excluding new tax credits, is a reasonable rate for full year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Bruce for questions.

Thank you, Bryan. Victor, we're now ready to take questions from the analysts if you want to queue them up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: All right. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Terry McEvoy from
Stephens. Your line is open.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.

Good afternoon, Terry.

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I definitely don't want to overlook a very good quarter in the outlook that Bryan just discussed, but I think I still
need to ask it. Bruce, internally, how are you, call it, managing the noise created from the 13D group? And maybe
more importantly, how has it impacted client growth at all? Definitely, I think you had 322 new commercial
customers last quarter. So that didn't seem to be the case, but I just want to at least ask those questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Terry. So, we will not be commenting on the 13D filing or group. But to answer your question, I
mean, we are very focused at the HTLF leadership level on executing the board-approved strategic plan. And I
would tell you that I'm just so proud of the leadership team for staying focused, and maybe more importantly, our
banks, bank presidents, heads of commercial, to be focused on organic growth, new customer acquisition, talent
acquisition, retention, the credit quality continues to improve, expense control, charter consolidation.
So what I did during the first quarter, Terry, is I went out and I visited five of our banks, spent a couple of days in
each market. I was in California, I was in Texas, I was in Kansas City, I was in Denver, I was in Montana, talking
to our teams and talking to customers, and I would tell you, they're just focused solely on new opportunities and
taking care of the customer and the customer experience and new relationships. And I would tell you, based upon
the results in the first quarter with new relationships and what our pipelines look like and my conversations with
customers, we feel very confident that we can deliver the $250 million of organic loan growth in the second
quarter, and it has yet to really affect the banks. It's clearly an issue that we're dealing with at the board level, but
at the customer level, our teams are focused.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thank you for addressing the topic, Bruce. And maybe a question for Bryan, just maybe your interest rate
outlook, if you could discuss new loan yields and what your thoughts are going forward. And then, on the deposit
side, how do you think deposits re-price and loan deposit betas as interest rates increase from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Good question. I think we're seeing a little bit of movement starting here now with loans with this first 25
basis points. We've seen some move up. We've moved up our consumer loan rates and some of our new quotes
on the commercial side are moving up as well. That should continue as we move up and the fed moves the next
50 basis points. I think you've seen, though, that most banks, us included, are struggling to get that normal beta
when rates go up on the commercial and the loan side. So, we anticipate then on the deposit side that we will see
lower betas. And we've been working hard with the banks to hold the line on deposit pricing. We think most other
banks are doing that, and we think that will continue for most, if not, all of this next 50 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thank you both – oh, sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And – yeah, no, no, no. Terry, I just wanted to indicate that I agree totally with Bryan on the first 50 basis
points. We do think we'll be more in the normal beta range in the – any rate increases after that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Oh, excellent, excellent. So my first question, probably for Bryan, on the expense outlook, you kind of guided back
down to the $107 million to $108 million range going forward. Can you just go through some of the puts and takes
there of how you're going to kind of come down from the $110 million level from this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think the first quarter, Damon, unfortunately kind of a couple of things that caught me by surprise. I
thought we probably could get some of those FTEs out that came out later in the quarter a little bit earlier. Our
RSUs probably hit a little bit higher in a week. First quarter always is a little bit higher for RSUs as we have to
expend some of those for people who qualify under our early retirement plan. So, those hit a little bit more in the
first quarter. We also have people who had bonuses and some of the incentive comp that hits in the first quarter.
They defer a little more in their 401(k), so we match a little bit higher. So, I think all of that is going to kind of
normalize as we go. And then, I do think as we exited the quarter, there's probably a few more FTEs that will
come out. So, I think all of that's going to help quite a bit. We did have just a couple of cleanup things, and the
occupancy, I think, will normalize as well pre-smaller items. And then, I think it's smaller items down the rest of the
expense categories that can get us a couple of million – a couple, $2 million, $2.5 million, maybe $3 million
reduction, depending on how things go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Damon. We feel...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...very confident. As Bryan laid out, that $2.5 million $3 million in reduction is – we've already got it identified, and
we'll continue to work hard to even find additional expenses as the teams are working through that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, with regards to the negative provision this quarter, I understand
you had the resolution of a longstanding ag credit, which kind of drove the net charge-offs. But with the growth
that you're putting on, kind of taking that negative provision and releasing reserves, like how do we think about the
provision going forward? Do you feel like you've kind of flushed out any excess reserves that you had, and now,
you're going to have to provide for loan growth going forward, or can you just give a little perspective on the
outlook for the provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say – and Bruce can jump in and Nathan can even jump in here, too – we're down at 115 basis
points of loans. That's getting pretty close to where we were when we initially implemented CECL. So, I think
we're getting towards that end where we're not going to have a lot less left to release. We do expect the charge-
off levels to remain historically kind of lower than they have been. So, that will help. So we may have a quarter or

two where we don't get fully normalized, but I think it's going to begin to normalize. I think we're going to be – I
could see this ramping up from zero to $1 million, kind of ramping up to a more normal, maybe $3 million to $4
million type of things we kind of charge forward here.

Nathan R. Jones A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I fully concur, Bryan, and nothing I would add at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just my final question, just given the size of the securities portfolio, with it
being over 40% of earning assets, and just given the pretty meaningful impact to tangible book value in the TC
ratio this quarter, is there anything that you guys can do differently to try to soften any future impacts if we
continue to have a volatile rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
There are some things we can do, Damon, at the margin. We're not, at least right now, planning to just totally
reposition the portfolio. That would be very expensive given right now. We think we're going to work our way
through. I think there's some things that we can do with the cash flow that's coming off and maybe some other
things that that can do that we can take some opportunities. But it's kind of a tough one because it's paper losses.
I don't think we want to run out and necessarily turn the paper losses into realized losses by churning the portfolio.
So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Damon, we feel pretty good about the cash flow that comes off at $75 million to $80 million a month. So, it's
$250 million a quarter. And we're able to reposition that right now at about a 2% higher rate than what it's coming
off, and we'll continue to do that and look at opportunities going forward.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Got it. Got it. Okay. Great. That's all that I had. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. You may begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a question on the rate environment, with LIBOR moving up steadily
throughout the quarter, I would have expected that we would have seen more improvement on the loan yield side.
Can you maybe explain why we didn't see any yield improvement or is there just a lag effect on the pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We have some lag effect. We have – one of the things is we've got floors in a lot of our loans. And so, we still
have, call it, $1 billion that are still on or below the floor. So, in other words, those have another 50 to 75 basis
point increase before they come out of their floor. So, those would have acted almost like fixed for this period of
first 25 basis point increase. I think that's part of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then I guess, what – I know you guys have made a push to target larger middle-market
companies. Was that also some of it, just with the lower yields that they garner?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think there's a little bit of that, Andrew. And that's offset by the credit quality and what we're seeing there. So,
there is a little bit of a tradeoff there. I think also, we were experiencing some of the loans that were maturing and
we're rewriting them in today's interest rate environment that there – just probably the last quarter where they're
coming off higher rates and we're putting the new loans on at lower rates. So, that's some of that timing that we
think now will move forward, we'll get the benefit of the increased pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then just on the agri-finance team that you have in California, looks like
they had some pretty nice growth. How does their pipeline stand [ph] in their (00:34:33) outlook for the next few
months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, their pipeline is just outstanding. Right now, they delivered almost $60 million of growth for us, of funded
growth during the quarter. And that really helped offset – as the first quarter in the ag world is normally down as
they've sold off their inventory. So, we were able to generate that, but it's a very strong pipeline actually. [ph] In
(00:35:04) about 10 days, we're going to go out there for a couple of days and make calls on some of those
customers. So, I'm really looking forward to that. But it's very strong pipeline.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Great. So, that's it for me, I'll step back. Thanks.

Thanks, Andrew.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
So, that last question may have – or the answer may have touched on what I was going to ask on. I guess your
expectations for Q1 growth versus reality much, much stronger. It sounds like the ag piece was part of it. But I
guess if I take into account your expectations for Q2 growth, it seems just net stronger, not like a timing thing that
production moved from second quarter into the first quarter. So, maybe outside of that ag being strong, what
maybe changed from your expectations to the actual net growth that you booked? What was stronger than
anticipated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. In the first quarter, what was stronger was the non-owner-occupied real estate, particularly the industrial
and distribution and warehousing, that was much stronger than we anticipated. We were able to generate some
new relationships, as well as some of our existing customers expanded their portfolios. Also, medical and life
science was stronger. And the funded ag piece was stronger because we anticipated because of utilization that
the ag book would be a little lower. But because of the strength of the agri business group in California, they more
than offset the decrease in utilization and paydowns based upon seasonality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And just wanted to – on the – maybe, Bryan, the expense guide, I wanted to confirm
that the restructuring costs are not included in that or are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Correct. I exclude those. This would be what I call core, so you take that lumpiness out. Correct.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And just, be it that might be lumpy. Is there any guess to timing on that, the restructuring cost, is it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We've paid – actually in terms of what we've paid, we've paid some vendors already. They haven't started.
They just started to do their work at the very end of the quarter, so that's going to ramp up. I think it was about
$600,000 that you saw in restructuring charges. Again, I don't have a great handle on this but I could see that
getting into the couple million dollars maybe this next quarter, but we'll see. It's all really timing and when things
progress. Certainly, once we start converting the banks then there'll be a lot of activity, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...timing of that could be a little bit, again lumpy, depending upon what expense it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. And Bruce, last one, and really circling back to the first question. Given the kind of the board noise
and I know that you're not really commenting on. I just want to kind of circle back on the strategy, if I could, on
capital use. Is it safe to say there's no change in your preference of the current voice in the room, board and
management team, of the organic versus M&A? Is that steady state or is there any pivot to highlight one or the
other currently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think that the way I would describe it is we're very focused on the organic side. Controlling what we
can control. We'll definitely be open to M&A as we historically have been. But as you know, stocks, bank stocks
have been depressed around pricing, and so therefore, we're very focused on, again, organic growth, attracting
new customers, controlling expenses, focusing on continuing to improve our credit.
And then, as Bryan has mentioned and I have, really working through the charter consolidation, although it's not
one at the exclusion of others. If an M&A transaction presented itself, we would put a slight pause on the charter
consolidation to work through that. So, we think all of them are part of our overall strategy and that's what we're
focused on executing on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. I appreciate it, Bruce. Thanks.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2022
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. Because there are no
further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to [ph] Mr. Lee for (00:40:43) comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Victor. The HTLF board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share on the
company's common stock, a 23% increase from a year ago. The dividend is payable on May 27, 2022.
In closing, HTLF had a solid first quarter. Organic loan growth increased $358 million or 4%. Our strong credit
quality improved even further. Total deposits increased $249 million to a record $16.7 billion. We're well
positioned to increase revenue in a rising rate environment. Our strategic investments in acquiring and retaining
talent are delivering strong organic growth and excellent credit quality.
And late in the second quarter, we expect to establish the first division of HTLF Bank as we continue executing
charter consolidation to deliver efficiency and unlock capacity for future growth. HTLF has momentum. We're
executing our strategies. We're driving growth. And we're well positioned to continue delivering strength, insight,
and growth.
Thank you for joining us. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late July. I'd also like to remain – like to remind
all our shareholders that our annual meeting will be held virtually on June 15 at 1:00 PM Central Time. Have a
good evening, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. [ph]
Everyone, (00:42:37) have a great day.
