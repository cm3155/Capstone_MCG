Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today. Please refer
to our Safe Harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 12 of the accompanying
presentation, which will apply to our commentary on this call.
During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-
up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask
questions as time permits.
Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.

Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Our results for the
quarter reflect continued progress executing against our strategic priorities, boosted by strong underlying equity
markets and favorable client activity levels. Trust fees were up a solid 6% over the prior year, deposit levels
proved resilient, and our capital levels reached a multiyear-high.
In the quarter, we participated in the Visa Class B common stock exchange offer, positioning us to monetize 50%
of our long-held stake in Visa. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax gain of nearly $900 million, with another 50%
of shares still to be monetized. We intend to use the Visa proceeds to fund additional share repurchases,
contribute to our charitable foundation, and make investments in the resiliency of our business. Reported results
also included approximately $200 million in restructuring charges and other notable items, reflecting our continued
efforts to optimize our cost base, drive efficiencies, and affect change within the organization. Jason will discuss
the details in a few minutes.
Turning to the performance of the business units. Wealth Management generated 9% year-over-year trust fee
growth, and our new business momentum remains strong. We're continuing to generate interest from our Secrets
of Enterprising Families national book tour, and we're seeing solid success from digital marketing initiatives. In
May, we hosted our Annual Northern Trust Institute Symposium, attracting more than 1,500 influential estate
planning attorneys, trust practitioners, and other wealth industry specialists who serve as key referral sources. We
also celebrated the opening of our new office in New York City.
Asset Management generated positive liquidity flows for the sixth consecutive quarter and delivered strong
performance within active fixed income. We raised assets in the private equity space in the quarter, although
index flows have otherwise been soft. NTAM continued to leverage our One Northern Trust strategy, delivering
clients the solutions and capabilities of the entire firm. Joint meetings between our Asset Management and Asset
Servicing businesses accelerated in the second quarter, leading to more than 100 new business opportunities
and 15 wins year-to-date. NTAM also launched seven new funds in the second quarter, expanding our global
liquidity business and adding to our fixed income solutions.
Our Asset Servicing business performed well in the quarter. Transaction volumes were healthy, capital markets
activities were up 16%, and new business growth continues to be booked at attractive margins. As we discussed,
our goal is to generate new business that is scalable. We've shifted our sales focus to opportunities that require
lower levels of incremental cost while emphasizing approaches with multiple points of connectivity. In addition to
the bundled sales generated with NTAM, more than 140 existing Asset Servicing clients have expanded their
relationships with us by adding services such as capital markets and data analytics. We're being disciplined on
pricing and bidding on fewer opportunities.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
In spite of our new, focused approach, Asset Servicing continues to realize momentum, particularly among asset
owners. In the second quarter, Northern Trust was appointed as the new custodian and Asset Servicing provider
for Nest Invest, the United Kingdom's largest workplace pension scheme. Initially an NTAM client, Nest supports
13 million members and has AUM of approximately $45 billion. Our ability to manage sophisticated strategies and
the flexibility of our open-architecture approach were the key factors that helped secure this highly competitive
win.
In North America, we've achieved more than 30 new wins year-to-date among asset owners. We entered the
second half of the year with strong market tailwinds and good new business momentum, well-positioned to
navigate the current macroeconomic environment and generate value for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance for the quarter. Jason?

Jason J. Tyler
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our second quarter 2024 earnings call.
Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on page 4.
This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $896 million, earnings per share of $4.34, and our return
on average common equity was 31.2%. Our reported results included an $878 million net pre-tax gain related to
Visa and $196 million of restructuring charges and other notable items, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.
Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up modestly on a sequential
basis and up sharply on a year-over-year basis. Strong equity markets drove the year-over-year improvement.
Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was up 5% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially.
Expenses were up 6.6% over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing
fees totaled $1.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 6% increase compared to last year.
Excluding notables in both periods, all other non-interest income on an FTE basis was down 2% sequentially and
up 9% over the prior year. We experienced good momentum in our FX trading business, where we saw another
strong quarter of client volume. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $530 million, down 1% sequentially and
up 1% from a year ago. Our credit quality remains very strong, with no net charge-offs and non-performing loans
representing 9 basis points of total loans.
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5. Assets under custody and administration for Asset Servicing
clients were $15.5 trillion at quarter-end, with Asset Servicing fees totaling $651 million. Custody and fund
administration fees were $446 million, up 4% year-over-year driven by both strong underlying equity markets and
new business activities. Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $1.1 trillion. Investment
management fees within Asset Servicing were $146 million, up 9% year-over-year due to favorable markets and
strong flows into our institutional liquidity funds.
Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6. Assets under management for our Wealth Management
clients were $419 billion at quarter-end. Trust, investment and other servicing fees for Wealth Management clients
were $516 million, up 8% year-over-year, due primarily to strong equity markets and asset inflows within Global
Family Office.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Turning to page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Average deposits were $113 billion, up
$1 billion or 1% from the first quarter, modestly better than our expectations. Deposit costs increased slightly due
to a handful of large, thinly priced deposits.
Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, our average earning assets increased 1% on a linked-quarter
basis, primarily due to higher deposit levels and the proceeds from the partial sale of our Visa shares. Our
average liquidity levels remain very strong, with highly liquid assets equal to 60% of our deposits, and more than
50% of total earning assets on average. The duration of our securities portfolio is 1.7 years, and the total balance
sheet duration continues to be less than one year. Net interest income was $530 million, and our net interest
margin was 1.57%.
Turning to page 8, as reported, non-interest expense was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 12% sequentially
and up 15% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods, as listed on the slide,
expenses in the second quarter were flat sequentially.
Now, let's take a step back and discuss how we're approaching the Visa stake. This is an asset we held on the
balance sheet at zero value since Visa went public over 15 years ago. Entering the quarter, the position was
approximately $1.8 billion in value on a pre-tax basis. With the ability in the second quarter to liquidate half of our
position at full value, the Visa transaction provides an opportunity to return more capital to shareholders while
accelerating certain strategic priorities.
With this first conversion of shares, we're taking the following steps, as Mike highlighted. First, a meaningful
portion of the proceeds will be used to increase pacing in our share repurchases. We began that process within
the second quarter and will continue at elevated levels over the next several quarters. Second, approximately
10% of the after-tax proceeds being contributed to our foundation. This pre-funds some of our community giving.
That contribution is fully accounted for in the second quarter.
Third, the Visa share conversion enables us to accelerate strategic investments over the next several quarters to
modernize our technology infrastructure and enhance our resiliencies. This includes investments in refreshing our
tech infrastructure, automating manual processes, enhancing risk management systems, reducing end-of-life
platforms, strengthening our cyber defenses and accelerating cloud migration. These investments will further
strengthen service levels and enhance the client experience while reducing risk and generating efficiencies. This
incremental modernization and resiliency spend is visible this quarter in the outside services line. We'll continue to
update you on our progress.
Separately, we also announced nearly $200 million in restructuring charges and notable expenses. The larger
items included severance expense of $85 million associated with a significant reduction in force split between
both compensation and outside services expense, various software write-downs and accelerations and the $70
million contribution to our foundation I mentioned earlier.
Now, let's go back and review our core expenses from the quarter, which exclude all notable items.
Compensation expense was up a little less than 3% versus the prior year, moderately better than we anticipated.
As some anticipated, hiring was shifted into third-party consulting work in conjunction with the incremental
modernization and resiliency spend visible within the outside services line. Full-time equivalent head count was
down 500 or 2% over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially.
Outside services expense increased by 12% relative to the prior period, the bulk of which reflects the incremental
modernization and resiliency spend. Equipment and software expense increased by 3% sequentially, slightly

better than anticipated, reflecting higher software consumption and amortization from projects coming online.
Excluding notables, our expense to trust fee ratio improved 200 basis points on a sequential quarter basis to
116%.
As we look out to the third quarter, we expect our sequential expense growth, adjusted for notable items, to be up
approximately 1%. Equipment and software expenses are expected to range between $270 million to $275
million, largely reflecting investments in technology and systems upgrades associated with the modernization and
resiliency initiatives. We do not expect a material increase in outside services in the third quarter from the current
elevated level.
Turning to page 9, our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter and we continue to
operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Based on the 2024 CCAR results, our stress
capital buffer will remain at the 2.5% minimum requirement. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the
standardized approach increased 120 basis points to 12.6%. A decrease in RWA levels, the Visa transaction and
capital accretion drove the improvement. This reflects a 560-basis-point buffer above our regulatory requirements.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter.
At quarter-end, our unrealized pre-tax loss on available-for-sale securities was $667 million. We generated $607
million (sic) [$606 million] (00:14:58) in the quarter from the sale of Visa shares and expect to generate another
$300 million in proceeds in early August. We returned $405 million to common shareholders in the quarter
through cash dividends of $154 million and common stock repurchases of $251 million.
With that, Jessica, please open the line for questions.

Operator: Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with
Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Hi. Good morning.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Betsy. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thanks so much. Okay. Yeah, sure. Two-part question. First is just on the remaining embedded gains
in the Visa that you still have. I know you mentioned that there is still some realization to come. Are you talking
about the one-third piece that's coming in the third quarter? Is that what you're referencing or are you referencing
the broader point that you still have more Visa shares and the next time this is able to get done, you'll have
access there?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it's both. So, if you just – you're close to it, but for people that may not be – this first tranche, they first
enable us to monetize half, but enable us to convert half. But that's split into actually selling it in three pieces, as
you're referencing. Two of those pieces are done. One is still yet to come in August. When that's done, we'll still
have half of the entire pool left, at some point in the future, to convert and monetize.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And that's a function of the Visa side and the B shares being opened up to monetize that's there. It's not
only your decision to do that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, correct, not at all. And as soon as – and we've said all along, Visa is not a strategic asset for us. And so,
we haven't wanted to monetize more at a meaningful discount in the private markets. And so, we've waited to be
able to do it in the public markets. This enabled us to do it with no discount and we'll likely pursue a similar path
when the remaining shares are opened up for conversion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Perfect. And then, just a separate part is on the resiliency investments that you're making. What's your
sense of the timeframe for the investments? I would think it's a multiyear timeframe, but be helpful to understand
your point of view on that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, I think about it in two pieces. One is that there's elevated spending right now as we get the project
accelerated. That's why it's showing up more in outside services. And as we get some of the technology spend
there and some third-party outside help on getting some things executed, that should last in that line item at about
this current level for the next few quarters.
Eventually, that's going to decline as some of that initial project work is done. But at the same time, we'll, over
time, see an increase in compensation as some of the work continues in more of a persistent environment by
actual FTE, but not likely at the same elevated level of where we are today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
That's the overall view of how it should work.

Jason J. Tyler A

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mokshith Reddy Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, it's Mokshith on for Ken. Just wanted to ask about just NII cadence for the rest of the year. What are you
assuming on deposit levels, deposit rates, and where we can see that going forward? Just wanted some color on
that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Yeah. So, balances are much more stable than they were last year, obviously, and our client engagements
worked well. At this point, the bigger factor definitely appears to be rates. So, there's no estimate for us to share
for third quarter. But in that period, we do tend to see a slight seasonal decline in balances. And so, there's a
couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. One, the seasonal decline in balances. But then, that could be offset by
the fact that we still have positive impact of reinvestment spread, day count improvement, and then some other
factors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mokshith Reddy Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Fantastic. Just more on just servicing, what are you seeing out there in terms of pipelines? And anything on
Wealth Management, whether – how the flows are there for client assets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I'll start and Mike may jump in. So, on Asset Servicing, we – Mike and I both referenced it briefly, the overall
activity in the business from a net new business perspective is, I think, very positive. The impact in this quarter
comes from the fact that we've got one client exit that we've known about for a long time. The big exits we have
with – we can – we have longer line of sight on, and that finally took place within the quarter, which reduced our
trust fees by a few million dollars in the quarter. I should also note, we also have line of sight to another similar
dollar amount impact in next – in third quarter that'll come in. But overall, the volume of activity is good and
pipeline is strong within the business. Mike?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add is, as I mentioned, we've really focused our strategy on the opportunities that we
think are most attractive for our value proposition, so those opportunities where we can be compensated for what
we believe to be is a higher service level for the clients. That has meant being more disciplined around pricing, as
I mentioned. In certain cases, it means not bidding on it if we believe it's going to be something that's low cost-
driven. And so, far, that hasn't really, I would say, reduced the overall momentum in the business and what we're
seeing in the opportunities. And frankly, it's resulting in higher margins for the business that we are winning. So,
it's a more selective approach to it, but one, so far, I would say, is going well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And then, I'll offer two headlines on Wealth, and then if Mike may add more. One is, the regions, the net new
businesses was relatively soft. But GFO in general continues to do well, bringing on new business from existing
clients, and then also some nice external names. Their – the connectivity they have with the largest asset owners
is outstanding and that – so that business continue to do well. And a lot of initiatives inside the more wealth
advisory space, the regions.
The second dynamic I'll mention within the business, a different view, is what are clients utilizing us for? The
advisory fee, the advisory component of what our clients are doing with us is doing well. It's positive both in the
regions and in GFO. What – but that's being offset by lower product utilization. That tends to ebb and flow, and we
look more closely at the advisory component. It's more of an indication of the base of business, and that's
trending positively in both businesses.

Brennan Hawken Q

Good morning. Hey, how are you? Good morning, Jason. Curious to know, and I couldn't find a specific disclosure
on this, so apologies if you have disclosed it separately. But could you tell me what percentage of your Wealth
Management client assets are in advisory accounts, and if you know what are the deposit costs for those
accounts?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I got most of that. Just – I just want to clarify the last sentence, how much of it is what?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
What the deposit costs on those accounts would be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Got it. I'm glad I asked because I did not hear that well. So, on the first component, we actually have not
historically disclosed the breakdown of our fees that come from product versus from advisory, but almost – just at
a high level, virtually all of our wealth, just particularly in the regions, virtually all of those relationships have an
advisory fee associated with them, and the vast majority have product fees associated with them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And then, in terms of deposit costs, we haven't talked about deposit costs for that group specifically. But I think
where you're going with it is accurate. The deposit costs in that client base are significantly lower than on the
institutional side, in general. Now, the GFO business, Family Office, has some clients that are equal in size to
some of our largest Asset Servicing clients but the bulk of that book is priced much more with lower deposit costs
relative to the institutional side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, I don't know if you had – or were aware of this or saw this, but in the last week, at this point, three of
the wirehouses have come out and said that they are bringing up the deposit costs on advisory relationships up to
equivalent to money fund levels. Wells and BofA did that in the second quarter, during the second quarter.
Morgan Stanley just yesterday announced that they intend to do it in the third.
Given that this is the direction – some of the largest providers in the industry are going this direction, what are
your thoughts and plans around making sure or aligning with this practice? And if you don't plan to, how do you
intend to manage any legal or lawsuit risk on fiduciary issues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Brennan, it's Mike. Within the business – it's true of all of our businesses, but just to be clear, within Wealth
Management as well, it's a competitive marketplace for all of the products that we offer. And so, to your point, if
other competitors or service providers in the space change their pricing on anything, frankly, but to your point on
deposit levels, then we absolutely have to react to that. So, that's the first point. It's dynamic.

The second, I would say, is that it's also based on the holistic relationship that we have and the entirety of what
we're offering for the client and, as a result, the different needs that they may have. Point being, I'll say, not every
deposit is created equally, almost as simple as just start with a checking account is different than a savings
account. And the terms and the nature and characteristics are different, and so the actual deposit costs, if you
will, is going to be different based on that as well. But needless to say, if others are doing things in the market, we
have to be able to respond in kind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. Fair enough.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And one other dynamic is our sweep clients within the Wealth business, they already have the option to sweep on
to our money market platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, that's a feature within the system where the advisor team or whatever could just adjust the sweep default and
go into the money fund rather than deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And to be clear, the client has the option to select what they would like to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Jason, you mentioned the $200 million restructuring charge, part of that is severance. What were the
underlying drivers for that charge? What might cause you to do that again? And what sort of future expense saves
do you expect from that, including for OpEx?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, drivers – it really comes down to productivity, Mike, and you've heard us talk about it a lot. And we've
got to continually look at the activities across the business and determine do we have the right skills, do we have
the right people, are we in the right geographies? And importantly also, we've got to look at the span of control
and the amount of layers we have in the organization, and all of those different analyses led us to the conclusion
that we could – we should take some actions here.
And so, we'll – though, obviously, even with an example like spans and layers, you might do eliminations, but then
you might also replace with – eventually, with a different skill set or a different span from a leadership perspective.
And so, we won't get 100% savings of these salaries, but we should get at least 50%. And in general, we'd
anticipate about half of the severance to impact our – a decline in the ongoing salary run rate.
Now, obviously, we're growing in other areas of the company. We're growing head count in Wealth Management
to grow that business. We're obviously investing in resiliency. But for these areas that are affected here, we
should see that type of impact in the salary line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, a permanent reduction in salaries equal to about half the severance, with some of that reinvested back
in the firm where you're hiring elsewhere, is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, let me clarify. So, it would be, the total amount of impacted salary would be close to the amount of the
severance line, but we would reinvest about half of it. And so, we should get an improvement from these areas in
the neighborhood of $40 million run rate on the salary line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, just more generally, maybe, Mike, you talked about productivity and the custody business
and you remain – it seems like you're committed in the custody business, but not just for growth, but for more
profitable growth and you say you're bidding less, you're being more selective, you're picking your spots. So, how
would you describe Northern's positioning in the custody business today versus the past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, a couple of points to it, Mike. One is, within, broadly speaking, Asset Servicing, at a high level, you
have the services that we provide to asset owners and then the services we provide to asset managers. Now,
there's a lot of hybrids within that as well and crossover of services. But largely speaking, those are the kind of

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
two big groups of clients. And within the asset owner part of the space, the nature of what we're doing there is
more scalable in the sense of, to your point, custody, where adding on a new client requires less in the way of a
head count addition and technology spend, if you will, to customize for what they're doing.
Now, you've also heard us, though, talk about certain things like front office solutions. That's a case where with an
asset owner client that we're looking to provide a higher differentiated level of capability for them and then,
correspondingly, have the associated fee that goes with providing that. So, that's how, I would say, in the
positioning there, we're trying to differentiate what we're doing, combination of capabilities like front office
solutions and with a higher level of service that is consistent, I would say, with our brand, with our culture and the
way that we approach the clients across the company.
And then, I would say, on the asset manager side, the asset manager services that we provide to them, that has
been a stronger source of growth for us over the last many years, but it is more resource-intensive. So, when you
look at the head count growth that we've had over time, a lot of that is because it's supporting bringing on new
business there that does require additional partners, meaning employees for us to provide that. And that's an
area, I'd say, we're trying to be much more selective about those relationships and the opportunities that we
pursue there.
So, you heard me also talk about connectivity points. And the point on that, Mike, is that, with an asset manager
client, for example, if we're only going to do one thing for them, it's probably not going to be attractive for us,
whereas if we can do a number of different things across the spectrum, that's where that type of client relationship
provides the level of profitability that we're looking for. So, that's where I'd say that the focus is when you look at
the business overall, but then within the segments.

Good morning. Maybe just one on net interest revenue. Maybe, Jason, just your view on deposit betas across
your franchise on the downside when the Fed cuts and if you could just differentiate between Wealth and Asset
Servicing? And I did see the interest-bearing deposit line on the average balance sheet, I think it's a smaller
category, but that seemed to go down a lot. I just was wondering what was driving that [ph] mix, 253 bps from 315
bps (00:34:42) sequentially?

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I want to make sure I get the last. What were you referencing on the last one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Oh, it's just on the average balance sheet, I think just the interest-bearing deposit with banks on the asset side,
well, it seemed to go down a lot. I don't know if it's just noise or – on the rate on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Might be – that might be the fixed repo...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, it's due – yeah, the due from banks. And we can come back to you. I think that's just noise in the reporting on
a small denominator. But in general on the betas, I mean, you saw the ECB reduction, we got effectively 100%
beta on that. And so, at this point, with rates at these levels, the betas are going to be very high.
And so, in that example, both – the standard rate card and the negotiated rates, both came down in conjunction
with the Central Bank change. And even the negotiated rates tend to be on a spread to Central Bank rates. And
so, we feel like, again, in this zone of where rates are, the spread shouldn't change materially.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And just differentiating between Wealth and the Asset Servicing business in terms of those deposit betas?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it's similar. The institutional business, sometimes you'll have, again, very large deposits. And so, that won't
change. That'll have more of what we should think of as a mix impact more than an impact coming from the rate
changes from central banks. So, we gave an example even earlier in the very small number of very large deposits
that can come on at tight spreads to central banks. And so, that will tighten spreads, but that doesn't – that's not
correlated to the actual Central Bank movements, which is really more the spirit of your question from what I'm
understanding.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, on the Wealth, just to hammer down on this, on the Wealth side, you've – across your Wealth franchise, do

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, the Wealth side is even a higher percentage of deposits on standard rates, which, again, with rates at this
elevated level, we'll be able to move in conjunction with Central Bank movements.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just on expenses [Technical Difficulty] (00:37:22) about the full year? Are you still targeting a 5%
[Technical Difficulty] (00:37:30)? I guess you have to have a downtick in 4Q. Oh, sorry, can you hear me?

Jason J. Tyler A

That's better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. I have my handset. Expenses for the full year. So, I know the 1% up in 3Q. Are you still targeting
the 5% or better expense growth for the full year and which would imply, I guess, a downtick in 4Q? And are you
still also targeting positive fee operating leverage, and maybe might that even be possible if net interest revenue
continues to hold up? Might it be possible to generate operating leverage on total revenue for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, on the expense – just expense year-over, we – 5% is going to be really hard. I mean, we're in the 6s
first half of the year, and we – and it's largely because of two factors. One, the market's elevated really quickly at
the beginning of the year, and that drove – just in the first quarter alone, it drove $10 million to $15 million in lift,
which is over 100 basis points year-over-year. And then, in conjunction with us deciding to accelerate the
resiliency work, that adds in another layer.

And so, it's going to be hard this year and unlikely this year. But it does not – our – still, our long-term target is 5%
or less, and there's no reason for us to change that long-term target, just two dynamics this year. One is frankly a
good one because we get positive operating leverage out of the markets being higher, and another one is us
positioning ourselves for lower expense growth rate in the future as a result of what we're doing on resiliency.
On the operating leverage side, we – on – from a fee operating leverage side, we should get fee operating
leverage in the second half of the year; and where the fee rates are higher, revenue is higher. And so, that puts
us in a good position. From a total operating leverage perspective, a little harder in third quarter, just based on
where markets are at this point, hard to tell. But fourth quarter, from what we can see at this point, would be much
more likely to have total operating leverage there.

Hey, Alex.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Hey, Jason, Mike. Good morning, everybody. So, I wanted to follow-up on the questions Brennan was asking
earlier, just as far as the Wealth dynamics go, and just, I guess, a couple of questions around that. I guess, one, it
sounds like you're evaluating still what the competitors have done. So, is it just kind of a matter of time before you
guys decide to kind of go through the same process? Or I guess, if you choose not to and outside of competitive
pressures, are there any other ramifications that might kind of force you and the industry to go down the same
path? So, like, in other words, are you hearing anything from the regulators? Are you hearing anything from
potential risk of litigation that could sort of ultimately force the industry to go in this direction? So that's the first
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

...where the firm has a fiduciary duty.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I just wanted to be clear – to clarify. So, in that space, in the – we already have – our rates are already at
market, and the clients and the advisors work together to determine what they want to select from a sweep
perspective. And so, they can elect to sweep into money market mutual funds or on to our balance sheet. But the
dynamics that we've read about, it doesn't – it's not reflective of our client base and of our platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Sorry. But I guess, if the industry goes to 5% and you're saying you're at market, but the market is at 5% on
deposits, does that mean you guys would have to go to the market rate at 5%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, we're closer to 5% now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, in terms of just the sizing, I think in the past you talked about I think about a quarter of the
deposit base was wealth, the other 75% was institutional. So, the quarter that is wealth, can you delineate like
kind of what the US deposit base is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
What the realized deposit base? Well, the quarter is – the 25% is roughly right. It's a little bit less than that, but
that's ballpark. And what else are you trying to get?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Just like what's the US piece of that is, is there a way to delineate that?

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Again, in the family – the Family Office business might have some that's inter – that's non-US. But the vast
majority of deposits on the Wealth side are US-denominated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Understood. Thank you. And then, just my follow-up question is around expenses. So, you guys are
implementing incremental savings initiatives. So, it kind of makes sense and that's causing maybe incremental
technology spend this year. As you sort of think about long term, and we've talked about expenses to fee ratio for
many years now, but given that it's still proven to be pretty sticky at this kind of 100-and-sort-of-15-ish percent
range, what's the goalpost as you kind of put this all through? It maybe it takes a year, two years, three years, but
what are you driving towards, and how long do you think it'll take you to get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Mike, do you want that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
The goalposts haven't changed, Alex. I mean, that – when I say the timing, not even saying like how far out it is
per se, but just, as you know, the components of that calculation are going to move at different rates for different
reasons, meaning markets and organic growth on the fee side. And then, likewise, you're going to have time
periods where the expense growth can be a little bit higher, a little bit lower on that part of the equation.
And so, the goalpost is still getting that to that 105% to 110%. We think that's our target operating range for that
ratio. And as you're seeing, we've we brought that down. Would we like it to go faster? Yes. But again, it's
balancing off the things that we need to do in order to drive organic growth so that you get it – the benefit of that
on the ratio.
And then, as Jason's saying, you make certain investments that you absolutely are looking to get greater
efficiencies as a result of those going forward. So, we have a lot of manual processes, for example, that we're
automating across not only the operations of our business, but also across other parts of the business that have
to do with our risk and control. So, a lot of opportunities there to, yes, improve the resiliency, as we've mentioned
a number of times, but also get efficiency out of it.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just want to understand, Mike and Jason, the severance charge that you're
taking, it's a much larger severance charge than we've seen you take in many years. I guess, the Visa gain gives
you that opportunity. When do you expect to start to show – have that show up in the compensation line and over
what period?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, we mentioned that a lot of the – many of the actions have already been taken. And at the same time,
the program that we instituted this time is more over 18 months. And so, it'll bleed in over – it'll get embedded
over that timeframe.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
But you've taken the charge right up front? Okay. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
All right. And when you – so, when you talk about the under 5%, [ph] right (00:46:21), Mike, you said – Jason, that
it's unlikely this year. Should this make it much more likely next year, where do you – given especially the
severance benefit that bleeds in over the next 18 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It puts us in a – it does put us in a better position next year. And the spirit of what we're doing, particularly with the
resiliency spend, is to accelerate some of the spend that we've had on our road map over the next several years.
So, that helps. And also, the actions we're taking around productivity help a lot as well. And so, it definitely puts us
in a better position, but we're – it's early July, and it's still early to talk about what next year looks like. But from
what we see right now, there's the things that are predictable at this point, there's no – there's nothing that tells us
we shouldn't have that 5% or better outlook for next year, and we feel like we're well positioned for it at this point,
given some of the things that we've talked about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And again, related to the Visa, pardon me if I missed anything because I just – there's a lot of earnings
going on this morning. But buybacks, you did some. Over what period should we see the rest given that you've
used about couple $100 million? Now, I know that's all pre-tax, but how much more should we expect to see and
how soon?

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, the Visa situation is very helpful and it puts several hundred million dollars, maybe call it half of the
after-tax proceeds in our minds available for buyback, particularly if you look at where our capital ratios are –
capital levels are right now. There's no race for us to do that. And so, we can do it over time. We can do it
deliberately. We also have to keep an eye on what's happening from a regulatory environment and what Basel
requirements might be from a capital perspective. But we're obviously positioned very well to continue to have
elevated levels of buyback.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thank you. And I'm sorry, Jason, if I'm being repetitive, I just wanted to make sure we heard
you correctly. The stock was down about 8% at one point, still down a lot. I just wanted to make sure that your
messaging on NII is essentially saying you expect third quarter NII to be relatively flat, given the decline in
balances should be offset by the investment yields? Am I hearing that correctly? And you're not really seeing any
impact from these sweep deposits that have impacted some of the other banks, given where you've already
priced deposits for your customers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Correct. We see third quarter NII at this point flat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

And from thereon, rate cuts, if we get them in September, should be a positive for the NII or negative?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Unlikely to – less likely to be positive. But we don't see – as long as rates are at these levels and just take US –
just take the Fed being in the 5s, at this high level of rates on an absolute basis, getting 25-basis-point, 50-basis-
point reductions at this point should not have material spread degradation.

That's helpful and clearer. And on the fee revenue side, apologies if we missed this, I think you mentioned you
lost a client, that's going to have a few-million-dollar impact. I'm just trying to get a sense of what your
expectations are for fee revenue, all else equal, as you think about the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No. Nothing to provide in terms of an estimate. And I mean, if you think about it, if it's a few million dollars this
quarter, a few million dollars next quarter, cumulatively that's a reduction of $10 million, round number, even
within Asset Servicing on a quarterly trust fee base of over $600 million. And so, we're just trying to – once we
start talking about growth in the business and about overall net new business activity, that number has more of an
impact, but it doesn't have as much of an impact on the overall amount of fees in the business.
And so, that's why we called it out, it's just in the context of thinking about new business activity and organic
growth, where it has more of an impact on a percentage basis. But in general, the business is doing well. And the
activity levels, the pipeline and what we see on the horizon is still good, just important to call out those two items.

Got it. And if I can sneak in one quick follow-up on expenses, the actions you took this quarter, you're not guiding
for this, my takeaway is it probably sets up for an even better or lower expense growth for 2025. Is that the right
way to interpret that relative to whatever you do in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it is. There's no doubt that some of the expenses that we put on now, again, it's an acceleration of what
we've planned and some of it, we do believe, will come down next year. I talked about the offset as we do some
hiring in some of these spaces. But we also came into this year feeling very good about the 5%, but the markets
moved early. And so, it does give an indication that when – markets move and it can impact the expenses. Again,
we have positive operating leverage in that, but at this point of mid-July, I'm hesitant to talk in too much detail
about 2025. We'll certainly give an update later in the year. But the spirit of your question is right in that some of
the spending now positions us for even better expense trajectory management going into next year.

Extremely helpful. Thank you.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to draw a specific understanding, because it was a little unclear
with Alex's follow-up to the question on the wealth deposits. Did you say that the advisory wealth deposits are

currently priced at 5% or they have the option to elect for money funds that could yield 5%? I'm just trying to
square all the commentary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, it's the latter. They have the ability to sweep into our money fund complex, which already is priced in the
5s. And so, our clients have the ability to elect for that deposit mechanism now to the extent that they are
sweeping.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So, just to further add a little color to my question, the option to move into money funds was available at
most of the wirehouses, too, and they made this move. But it's my understanding, due to concerns about the
fiduciary obligation and whether or not just basically paying out that level, would be just necessary from a legal
perspective. So, it sounds like, from your answer, you guys don't have any plans to make any change at this
stage, although, as you said, depending on competitive pressures, you may seek to make adjustments, going
forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think that's a good summary.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Excellent. Thanks very much.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
You bet.

Operator: And we'll return to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Just wanted to clarify, Jason, a comment you made, which was, rate cuts, 25 to 50 basis points should
not have material spread degradations. So, does that mean, if we do have rate cuts, those would be hurt – that
would hurt your NIM and NII, as you are asset-sensitive?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, I'm saying that as we have rate cuts at this point, we – that we should be able to pass along those declines in
the form of lower deposit yields to clients in our standard rate cards and in our negotiated rates.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Okay. What did you see with the ECB 25-basis-point rate cut that has come through? Have you cut those deposit
rates by 25 basis points?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, and I did comment on that really specifically earlier. We did see aligned reductions in deposit costs
on the ECB change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That means you passed on the full 25 basis points?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sorry. There are – just as I said, there are too many earnings calls today, and you are overlapping with others, so
that makes it hard to keep up with all of them.
