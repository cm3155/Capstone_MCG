Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
And now, Kevin Blair will provide an overview of the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our team
delivered another solid quarter with growth in revenue and earning assets, while maintaining an expense
discipline that resulted in year-over-year quarterly expenses declining 5%. Additionally, we continue to see an
improving credit outlook that produced a release in allowance. Finally, we continue to successfully deliver on our
Synovus Forward initiatives and investments, with the $75 million in pre-tax run rate benefit achieved through the
second quarter and an additional $100 million in pre-tax run rate benefits to come by year-end 2022.
Before I proceed, let me take a second to remind you of our performance to-date as it compared to our
expectations at the beginning of the year. We shared with you that we would deliver loan growth, excluding PPP,
and ramp it up in the second half of the year. We also said we would improve the deposit mix and lower our cost
of funds to stabilize the margin. Also, we would drive efficiency initiatives that will assist in returning to positive
operating leverage, while continuing to manage effectively through the uncertain credit environment and produce
the planned benefits from Synovus Forward. I am pleased to share with you today that we are delivering on those
objectives and we concluded the first half of 2021 with considerable momentum and are optimistic about the
prospects for growth and expansion moving forward.
Our commercial loan pipelines are back to pre-pandemic levels, with continued growth in C&I outstandings and
commitments, and line utilization actually increased slightly during the quarter. Client liquidity remained strong,
which has allowed us to further optimize our deposit mix and reduce our cost of funds again this quarter. We'd
expect this trend to continue in this low rate environment.
Our wealth and treasury and payment solution businesses are performing at a high level. Continued growth in
operating margin expansion in these fee income generating business units will help to offset the industry-wide
reduction in mortgage activity. Criticized and classified loans declined for the quarter. Another proof point that the
elevated credit concerns raised by the pandemic continue to abate and signal the opportunity to continue to move
the allowance over time back down towards day one CECL levels.
And during the first half of the year, we continue to invest in the future of Synovus, key priorities to enhance the
customer experience and deliver new sources of growth. A couple examples of this include our treasury and
payment solutions business launched a new suite of integrated receivable solutions called Synovus Accelerate
AR. This solution has been well-received and the sales pipeline has already begun to fill, which will create a new
source of revenue while significantly benefiting our customers by saving them time and money.
We also have migrated approximately 25,000 business clients to Synovus Gateway, our new digital platform for
business and commercial banking. With expanded functionality and capabilities, we are making it easier for our
customers to do business and promoting higher levels of business retention.
Lastly, our SMART analytics tool, which we've shared previously, has been further rolled out across our bankers
and our markets and is beginning to have an impact on increasing pipelines and opportunities to expand the
share of wallet from our customers.
We are also reminded during the second quarter that our focus on delivering a personalized and value-added
customer experience matters, and we'll continue to provide a foundation for future growth. Industry-wide,

consumer satisfaction surveys again show that our clients are more satisfied and loyal than those of our
competitors. And we also received two awards of excellence for our Family Office during the quarter. These
scores and accolades are not success in and of themselves, but rather affirmation that our efforts and our
approaches are having meaningful impacts for our customers. For all of these reasons, as well as the vibrant
economic expansion that we expect to continue in the Southeast, we remain confident in our path forward.
Moving to slide 3, which includes our financial highlights for the quarter, total adjusted revenue of $489 million,
adjusted expenses of $268 million, and a $25 million reversal, a provision for credit losses, resulted in adjusted
net income of $179 million, or $1.20 diluted earnings per share. Without adjustments, net income was $178
million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share. Pre-tax run rate benefits from Synovus Forward of $75 million, have
increased by $25 million from the first quarter results. Our work on completed and future initiatives continues to
give us confidence in our ability to achieve an aggregate pre-tax run rate benefit of $100 million by year end 2021,
and $175 million by the end of 2022.
Total loans, excluding P3 loans, were up $194 million in the second quarter. Growth in the quarter was delivered
in our core C&I portfolio, as well as third-party consumer lending, given the continued high liquidity environment.
Despite solid production levels, elevated prepayment activity remains a headwind in our commercial and
consumer real estate portfolios. Core transaction deposits increased $702 million, or 2%, led by core non-interest
bearing deposits growth of $601 million, or 4%. With the current loan to deposit ratio, we continue to remix the
deposit base, strategically reducing higher cost categories including CDs and broker deposits.
Key credit metrics were stable, with the NPA ratio declining by 4 basis points to 46 basis points, and the ACL
coverage remained strong. A more favorable economic outlook and a 14% reduction in criticized and classified
loans supported further allowance releases. The ACL ratio, excluding P3 loans, declined 15 basis points to
1.54%. We remain well-capitalized with the CET1 ratio increasing to 9.8%, while completing nearly half of our
$200 million share authorization in the quarter. We also executed on additional earning asset growth activities to
monetize excess liquidity while keeping capital above our operating target.
With that serving as an overview for the quarter, I will now turn it over to Jamie for a more detailed financial
update, and I'll rejoin you later for an update on Synovus Forward and our guidance. Jamie?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. As shown on slide 4, we ended the quarter with earning assets of $51 billion. Total loans
declined $569 million, led by P3 balance declines of $763 million. While gross production levels continue to
improve, the liquidity environment continues to result in downward pressure on loan demand. While our
customers are utilizing less of their line commitments, we are continuing to grow overall commitments to new
client relationships and deeper existing relationships.
The annualized growth rate and total commitments over the past two years is more than 3% compared to an
annualized increase in funded loan balances of approximately 1%. A material portion of that growth will translate
into funded balances once C&I line utilization begins to normalize closer to the long-term average of 46% to 47%.
Based on market intelligence and conversations with our clients, we believe increases in line utilization will occur
later in the cycle as client liquidity subsides. Our base assumption, included in our loan growth guidance, is that
line utilization will remain near current levels through year end.
While commitment growth will support longer-term loan growth, our confidence in the forecast for the near term is
based on continued strong production, growth in the commercial loan pipeline, and our expectation that the

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
elevated level of payoffs and paydowns will abate. Another factor that gives us confidence in loan growth is more
recent monthly data. In June, total loans excluding changes in P3 balances, grew by approximately $200 million.
In the second quarter, further declines in consumer mortgage and HELOC portfolios of $98 million and $74
million, respectively, continued to be impacted by accelerated prepayment activity and excess liquidity.
CRE loan declined about $173 million this quarter, largely resulted from accelerated payoffs, as many owners are
selling with the expectation that capital gains taxes will increase in 2022. C&I balances, excluding changes and
P3, increased $220 million with $469 million in commitment growth, while C&I line utilization remain near historic
lows. As a reminder, a normalization in C&I line utilization, would result in more than $700 million in funded
balances.
We had approximately $150 million in fundings of round two P3 loans, net of unearned fees, which partially offset
forgiveness of $927 million. Total P3 balances ended the quarter at $1.6 billion. There's more detail related to P3
loan activity in the appendix.
Lastly, as a function of this liquidity environment, we increased the securities portfolio about $616 million and third
party consumer portfolio about $273 million. The risk profile of asset acquisitions was largely consistent with those
completed in the first quarter, with emphasis in mortgage-backed securities and secured third-party consumer
loans. Investment securities accounted for 17% of total assets at the end of the quarter and could increase further
as we look for opportunistic deployments of liquidity in the second half of 2021.
As shown on slide 5, we continue grow core transaction deposits, which increased $702 million, or 2%, from the
prior quarter. This was led by core non-interest-bearing deposit growth of $601 million, or 4%, which offset
strategic declines in higher cost deposits. We continue to have success reducing our total deposit cost in the
second quarter with a reduction of 6 basis points, from 22 basis points to 16 basis points. This was driven by a
combination of deposit mix optimization with a continued focus on strategic reductions in high-cost time deposits,
as well as a reduction in the expense associated with interest-bearing deposits.
While the pace of CD maturities will slow significantly, there are opportunities to further improve the deposit mix
and reduce rates paid on other interest-bearing deposits as we progress through the second half of 2021. For the
month of June, total deposit costs were 15 basis points. And we expect further reductions in total deposit costs
this year.
Slide 6 shows net interest income of $382 million, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter. NII increased
as benefits from asset growth reduced deposit costs, and day count more than offset the reduction in P3 fee
income.
The net interest margin of 3.02%, a decline of two basis points, was primarily impacted by P3 forgiveness as P3
fee accretion decreased $5 million from the prior quarter. Other dynamics are similar to recent quarters and the as
headwind from asset repricing is being offset by further reductions in liability cost. As expected, slower
prepayment activity in the latter part of the quarter helped to improve the yield on the securities portfolio,
supporting both margin and NII. Based on current mortgage trends, we'd expect modest further improvement in
that yield in the third quarter, as the impact of a full quarter of more normalized prepay activity is realized.
Deceleration of prepayment activity resulted in a $3 million reduction of premium amortization in the second
quarter, down from $20 million in the first quarter.
In terms of asset sensitivity, we remain positively exposed to potential increases in interest rates. That dynamic
continues to be supported by the aforementioned shifts in our balance sheet, including funding mix, with the

estimated exposure being split between both short-term and long-term rates. As of June 30, our loan portfolio is
54% variable and approximately 30% of those variable rate loans have floors at or above short-term index rates of
25 basis points.
Based on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth, we reiterate our expectation that
quarterly net interest income, excluding P3 fee accretion, should increase in the second half of the year, driven by
loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments, and further deposit cost reductions.
Using the quarter-end forward curve and absent rate hikes, we expect a NIM of approximately 3%, excluding the
impact of P3 with headwinds from the laps of P3 fee accretion being offset by the continued deployment of excess
liquidity and with notable upside coming from increases in either short-term or long-term interest rates. As we've
shared previously, we estimate NIM dilution of approximately 6 basis points per $1 billion of excess cash on
deposit at the Federal Reserve.
Slide 7 shows the total adjusted non-interest revenue of $106 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter.
Embedded in the continued strength and fee revenue is diversified growth across our fee revenue sources,
partially offsetting the continued normalization of the mortgage business from all-time high levels of production.
Core banking fees were $41 million, up $3 million. Increases were broad-based led by $1 million increases in
account analysis fees that benefit from our treasury and payment solutions team and our recently end-sourced
merchant business. NSF or overdraft fees, which have received a lot of attention throughout the industry were flat
at $6 million, accounting for less than 6% of non-interest revenue and 1.3% of total revenues.
Net mortgage revenue declined $8 million in the second quarter to $14 million, due to reductions in secondary
production and gain on sale. This remains above pre-pandemic levels and we expect continued normalization in
the second half of 2021. Increases in fiduciary revenues of $3 million, helped offset decreases in other areas,
including capital markets income. Assets under management grew 3% in the quarter and 28% from the previous
year. The build-out of wealth management and other fiduciary services, particularly in South Florida, will continue
to provide meaningful growth opportunities.
Total non-interest expense of $271 million is highlighted on slide 8. Adjusted non-interest expense was $268
million, up $2 million from the prior quarter and down $6 million from the prior year. Adjusted items include the
impact of an earnout liability, non-qualified deferred compensation, and restructuring fees, primarily related to
branch closures. Employment expense of $159 million was down $1 million from the prior quarter, as seasonal
decreases in payroll taxes was partially offset by an increase in pay days as well as commissions and other
variable compensation.
Expenses of $42 million associated with occupancy, equipment, and software increased $1 million in the previous
quarter, largely due to an increase in the repairs and maintenance. As Kevin will touch on later, we continue to
evaluate and optimize our branch and non-branch real estate for additional efficiency opportunities. Other
expenses of $67 million were up $3 million, primarily due to the $4 million increase and third-party processing
fees associated with expenses from additional P3 forgiveness and third-party consumer loans.
Our commitment to prudent expense management and profitable growth allows us to continue to invest in
strategically compelling high-return growth sectors. We have reduced our head count 6% year-over-year,
approximately 85% of which was on the support side. This reduction in the head count is a key priority in our
expense management efforts. However, there are some offsetting cost as we promote team members who are

taking on more responsibility and continue to hire customer-facing team members. Our expectations for expenses
and benefits from Synovus Forward remain unchanged.
Slide 9 highlights stable credit metrics, which remain near historical lows. We continue to see improvement in the
overall economic outlook, which is reflected in the reversal of provision for credit losses of $25 million and a 14%
reduction in criticized and classified loans. Support for the ratings improvements comes from client conversations
and cash inflows. As shown in the appendix, cash inflows from March to May are each up more than 10%
compared to the same period from 2019, which we use as a pre-pandemic baseline.
The annualized net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 0.28%. We expect net charge-offs to remain relatively
stable in the second half of 2021, assuming no material change in the economic outlook. During the second
quarter, the NPA ratio declined 4 basis points to 46 basis points. Criticized and classified loans fell 14% and we
expect further reductions as we progress through the rest of the year.
The ACL ratio of 1.54%, excluding P3 loans, was down 15 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points
from the end of the year. We continue to use a multi-scenario framework in our CECL modeling and assign a 40%
weighting to adverse scenarios, 55% weighting to the base scenario and 5% weighting to an upside scenario.
As noted on slide 10, the CET1 ratio increased 1 basis point to 9.75% as a result of strong performance. The
build in capital was deployed via risk-weighted asset growth, share repurchases and our common equity dividend.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $92 million of the $200 million share repurchase authorization in place for
2021, which resulted in a 1.3% reduction of average diluted outstanding shares. We have completed
approximately $15 million of additional repurchase activity in July. Based on current conditions and economic
outlook, we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year.
We will continue to opportunistically deploy capital on our balance sheet and to our shareholders as we remain
above our 9.5% operating target for CET1. We remained well-positioned to complete our key strategic objectives,
including profitable growth with the highest priority being multi-solution relationships.
With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin.

Thanks, Jamie. At the beginning of 2020, we laid out our Synovus Forward plan to deliver significant upside in
earnings power through a set of strategic actions to enhance our efficiency and accelerate top line growth. The
Synovus Forward initiatives are aligned with our strategy of building a high growth, low risk, nimble bank that can
continue to take market share in our attractive Southeastern markets.
As I highlighted earlier, throughout the second quarter, we have continued to add to our Synovus Forward pre-tax
run rate benefits, now totaling approximately $75 million. As you can see on slide 11, we have delivered these
results through a combination of expense and revenue initiatives, based upon our progress to-date as well as the
ongoing plan and execution, we remain confident in achieving the 2021 and 2022 milestones of $100 million and
$175 million, respectively.
Success to-date on the expense front has largely come from three primary areas, a reduction in third party spend,
a decrease in head count, as well as branch and corporate real estate consolidation. Approximately $50 million of

the $75 million pre-tax run rate benefit we have achieved by the end of the quarter, relates to these specific
efficiency initiatives.
We have plans to increase the savings in each of these categories, but also are adding new initiatives in areas of
focus to achieve an incremental $30 million to $40 million in pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022. Additional third
party savings, workforce optimization, a reduction in branch and non-branch square footage, process automation,
and additional tax strategies will all contribute to drive future efficiencies. We have also had success to date on
the revenue side of Synovus Forward, with $25 million in pre-tax run rate benefits.
The treasury and payment solutions pricing for value initiative has resulted in annualized pre-tax run rate benefits
of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. The realization of a broad-based increase in pricing has been
supported by the competitive landscape, enhancements to our products and services, and a commitment to
providing proactive needs-based advice. In addition, with the deployment of a new pricing tool and the continued
low-rate environment, we have also been able to reduce our cost to funds to levels lower than was originally
expected. And we now have a more robust capability and tool to better manage customer rate elasticity as we
move into a higher-rate environment in the future.
Additional areas where we have seen incremental revenue include the insourcing of our merchant business and
expansion of our merchant sponsorship business, and expanded solutions such as trade finance and international
payment and currency capabilities.
As we turn to future plans and initiatives, the $60 million to $70 million in expected pre-tax revenue benefits will
large be accomplished through analytics, new products and solutions, balance sheet management strategies as
well as ongoing talent and specialty team expansion.
As it relates to analytics, we continue to make progress on our four mentioned commercial analytics pilot, which
we refer to as the SMART tool. The feedback and utilization thus far are encouraging as our bankers are working
to actionable leads and insights that are now translating into new sales and overall expansion of the share of
wallet of our existing clients. We will continue to pilot in the third quarter with a company-wide rollout in the fourth.
In addition, we have begun to develop our retail analytics program, which will also have a meaningful impact in
our ability to deepen the share of wallet of our consumer and wealth customers while reducing the overall levels
of attrition.
We are expanding our premium finance and specialty lending businesses, adding strong new teams in highly
attractive specialized verticals as well as launching targeted, innovative products and capabilities to serve as new
sources of revenue growth. As I've noted in the past, Synovus Forward is a constant improvement mindset, not
just a collection of initiatives. I am pleased with our team members' focus on the art of possible as we continue to
innovate and find new ways to become more efficient and drive new sources of revenue.
And I would be remiss if I didn't end this slide with an update on technology in general. We clearly feel that our
competitive advantage will come from our high-touch approach, complementing our high-tech investments and
partnerships. We continue to make progress in enhancing both the consumer and the commercial client digital
experience. We are partnering with the right fintechs to build and deliver new products and solutions and we have
a roadmap to move to a modern core over time in a segmented and controlled fashion. We will continue to focus
on ways to increase online origination capabilities and evaluate new technological opportunities, especially in the
payment and banking-as-a-service areas.

Moving to slide 12, this includes our 2021 outlook, which have a few key changes. With the first half of the year
behind us and greater certainty in the economic outlook, we'd like to provide some updates and additional clarity.
I'll begin with loan growth. We still expect to be within our 2% to 4% loan growth guidance, excluding P3 loans
and third-party consumer loans. However, we think it's likely that we're at the low end of this range, due primarily
to the elevated prepayment activity that we have seen today that was not anticipated at the beginning of the year.
This assumes line utilization remains at current low levels and prepayment activity returns to a more normalized
level.
As a reminder, we do not include third-party consumer loans in this guidance. This asset class represents $1.5
billion in period end balances, up $776 million in 2021. Pre-pandemic, this portfolio was approximately $2 billion in
held for investment outstandings.
Over the past five-plus years, we have had a successful track record with originating and managing these credits,
providing incremental revenue and solid returns. We will continue to employ this strategy as long as the excess
liquidity environment persists, as well as the relative returns of future purchases are constructive. We're raising
our expectation for total adjusted revenue and total adjusted expense. As a reminder, it's appropriate to consider
these together, because areas that are providing additional revenue including mortgage production and higher
third-party consumer balances, have associated expenses related to them and these examples, commission and
servicing expense.
And while we remain committed to taking advantage of growth opportunities in the Southeast, we also remain
committed to achieving positive operating leverage and that is one of our top priorities for 2021. We are not
incorporating any significant change in interest rates as part of the updated guidance, although it's important to
note the increased asset sensitivity Jamie referenced earlier, as any increase in rate, will provide a meaningful
tailwind NII. Our capital management target now includes a CET1 ratio greater or equal to our 9.5% target. A
continuation of strong operating performance and a stable economic outlook is likely to result in a CET1 ratio
above 9.5%, even after completing the entire $200 million share repurchase authorization for the current year.
Additional focus and execution related to various tax strategies are expected to result in an effective tax rate of
22% to 24%. Year-to-date, the ETR is 22% or 23% before discrete items.
The actions we've mentioned throughout today's call further position us for success in the second half of the year,
but also long-term success. It's important to note that the efforts and continued investment in Synovus,
strengthens our currency and provides opportunities for strategic growth, both organic and inorganic.
We're looking forward to the second half of 2021. And I feel an increased level of excitement from our entire team
as we roll out our future of work operating environment this quarter. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for
growth with strong capital and liquidity. Our team members are delivering and they're very passionate about
winning. And our pipeline show that clients are poised to grow their business with Synovus as their partner.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our operator for the Q&A portion of today's call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Good morning, Michael. How are you?

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good. Hey, I just wanted to start on the loan growth outlook. It looks like if I exclude PPP and then the third-party
loans which were up this quarter, you guys were down a little bit in both the first and the second quarter. If I'm
doing the math right, it looks like on a core basis, ex those two lines that the guidance would imply some positive
growth in the back half of the year. So can you just kind of reconcile the comments around why utilization
remained low, paydown is still remaining high and what would appear to be a positive inflection point in those,
kind of core loan balances? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, it's a great question. I think, before I talk about the rest of the year, I think it's important to make
sure that we're all clear on what happened this past quarter. When you exclude PPP as you mentioned, we
actually grew $195 million for the quarter. Large piece of that was on the C&I side, we grew $220 million this
quarter and that was on the backs of very strong production. We were actually up 10% versus the first quarter and
19% versus the second quarter of last year. We also grew the third-party portfolio roughly $273 million. And as
we've shared in the past that's really a surrogate to the securities book. And we felt with the excess liquidity and
capital we had, we would continue to make those purchases as long as the returns made sense.
I think, on the CRE side, one thing that's lost in this quarter is that we also saw good increases in funded
production, they are up 35% versus the first quarter. But unfortunately, we saw unprecedented levels of payoffs
as we saw borrowers start to take some chips off the table, leading up to what they perceived to be an increase in
the capital gains tax. So, we saw a run-off there of about $173 million.
So, inside of the quarterly growth, there are some underlying stories. We've seen our pipelines return to pre-
pandemic levels, up 22% versus the previous quarter and in line, as I said, with previous year pipelines. As I
mentioned production is increasing across our franchise, primarily on the commercial side, but production in total
is up 12% from the first quarter. When you look at our commercial lines of business, we actually had – in our sub
lines business, we have 12. 11 of the 12 actually grew during the quarter, only our CRE business declined
because of those payoffs and paydowns. We also saw tremendous momentum going into June where C&I loan
growth in June was $160 million and CRE actually grew in June $10 million dollars.

And to your point on line utilization, it's not a Herculean task, but it's up 1% from 39.1% to 40.1%. So we're
starting to see a little bit of activity there. And we saw broad-based industry growth, whether it was in the finance
and insurance area, transportation, warehousing, healthcare, across several of our industry. So, in general, what
gets us excited about the second half of the year is that we're starting to see some momentum build both through
pipelines and production. We're starting to hear from our customers, the demand is picking up. And we think
there's been kind of a secular move across the industry to hold more liquidity on their balance sheet, which means
that they'll start to borrow again before the balances completely run off from having the excess cash.
So, we're optimistic and we're planning for the second half of the year to deliver that growth, to be able to achieve
that 2% to 4%. But as we said, we think it'll be towards the lower half of that range.

That's great color, Kevin. I really appreciate it. And maybe just as my follow-up, if we can hit on expenses, can
you give a lot of color on the Synovus Forward and the progress that is continuing there? But I assume, like
everybody else, you're continuing to invest in the franchise. It looks like if I take kind of the mid-point of the
guidance, it would imply that expenses on an adjusted basis would remain relatively flat at these levels in the next
couple of quarters. Is that the way we should think about it? And maybe if you could just kind of outline some of
the reinvestment initiatives and what the priorities are? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, this is Jamie. You're right on the second half of the year and expenses are expected to be flat due
to increases and a few different things. We have third-party servicing expense, our portfolio there is larger than
we had originally guided towards at the beginning of this year. We also have increased third-party processing
expense, associated with P3 forgiveness. And lastly, we have variable compensation expectations.
We do continue to invest in the franchise, specifically, you see it in multiple areas. First, I would point to
technology advancements to help us deliver our businesses better. A good example of that is, we recently
launched the Accelerate AR program, which is an accounts receivable solution for our treasury customers. That's
only six weeks old and we're now on track to receive about $2.5 million in annualized revenue from that just six
weeks in. We're also looking at our verticals. We're looking at our customer-facing team members and growing
frontline associates where appropriate. And all of that spin is embedded in our full year guidance for 2021.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Kevin, you mentioned you anticipate Synovus will migrate to a modern core over time. Can you
give us some details on that comment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jennifer. It's a part of our infrastructure investments that we believe we have to make over time. Now, what
you won't see is that Synovus will do a rip and replace and move off of our mainframe core today over into a
cloud-based core tomorrow. What we'll do is, we'll start by in a segmented fashion start to move over certain
products and certain capabilities, potentially create new capabilities that we could add on to the modern core or a
digital platform.
And then over time, as it make sense, we would then move the core businesses over there. We think that's a
prudent approach versus doing it all in kind of that rip-and-replace methodology. And it allows us to expand our
capabilities and new functionality in that agile platform with that API connection where we really need it. And that's
the real value of moving to the modern core. As we've shared is it allows you to be much more agile in adding
new solutions, adding new applications and new services for our customers. So that's how we would view the
ability to move things over. And we'll do that over several years where we have the opportunity to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I think, the industry will follow that kind of pattern as well, Kevin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think so, Jennifer, just because no one wants to hear that there's a massive increase in expense in order
to do that. So, the way that you do it in a more efficient fashion is to be able to go out and do it over time in
components where you move parts of your business. And ultimately, then it allows you to have a pathway to get
all of your business over to the modern platform.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it's – for us, we call it our Here Together program, Jennifer. But I think, it's important to note for
Synovus, we've already brought back roughly 60% of our team members in the office. So, we have about 40% of
our team members that continue to work remotely today. And so, we've really spent the summer evaluating job
family by job family to determine which one of those positions we felt like needed to be in the office 100% of the
time, and which team members needed to have more of a flex work schedule. And then that left a third set of
team members that would be 100% remote.
And so, as we're rolling this out, our next level of return to work will be in the middle of August, where we'll have
those team members that now will come back to work full-time. That represents about 400 additional team
members. And then, at the end of August, we'll roll out our flexible work schedule, which is about another 500
team members that will begin to come in the office three days a week and then two days off-site. And that leaves
us with around 1,200 team members that will continue to work remotely 100% of the time.
We feel that it's important in today's environment for talent to assess which positions needed to work remote.
Number one, we want to make sure we're testing and monitoring the productivity which we can for those
positions. Number two, I think, for the competition of team members, it was important for the 1,200 that we
identified, we felt like this was a work environment perk that was necessary to be able to retain and attract the
right level of talent. But with all of that, we look at this as the next normal. It's not permanent. We'll continue to
evaluate the effectiveness of our workforce and make any adjustments that we need to make going forward.

Jennifer Demba Q

If I could just ask one more thing, how much wage pressure are you seeing right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Jennifer, we're starting to see some increases in attrition in some of our entry-level positions. And we've seen
some positions where individuals can work remotely for their job and that job could be in Texas or California or
New York. And so, we're starting to see a little bit of that. So, you'll see and we've addressed that with our internal
teams. We made an adjustment, a salary adjustment, for all of our team members below kind of our median
salary level, and we also provide our leaders with additional pools of funds to make sure that we're continuing to
match or combat what's becoming a fairly competitive landscape as it relates to salary and compensation. But it's
really started to hit us in the last couple of months and especially as it relates to those entry-level positions.

Good morning, EB.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to follow up on the – Jennifer's question around the modern core conversion, Kevin. Talk to us, I
mean understand you're doing it in a segmented way, one, what is the timeline of that? Is it 2023, is it beyond
that? And in the meantime, does it not allow you to do certain things that a full conversion would? Just give us a
sense of how important that conversion will be, both, one, in terms of the timing and the additional capability that
Synovus could have in order to compete with banks or non-banks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Ebrahim, it's a great question. We haven't set a timeframe. And I think that's important as part of the story,
because to me what will determine the ultimate conversion will be the success of some of these fragmented pilots
that we'll run. So, if we set up a digital bank or move some of our products over on to the new core, we may test
one vendor, two vendors. It really is a pilot for us to figure out what's the most scalable way to do that. But we'll
learn from those pilots and ultimately that will determine what the ultimate timeframe is.
Now to your question as to limitations by doing this in a fragmented approach, we don't believe so. I think today,
we feel like we can continue to add new products and solutions that are necessary, it just takes a little more time.
We can work with our core provider and make sure that we schedule out the timeframe that's required.
A great example of that is the example that Jamie mentioned earlier on the Accelerate AR. We were able to, from
contract, to open it up for folks to apply. It was 171 days and we did that with a mainframe core platform that
needed to connect to that system. So, it doesn't prohibit us from doing things. We're just excited about the speed
that what a modern core would bring to the table, where you can do things even more efficiently and more – less
costly in the future, but it's not something that will inhibit our abilities in the short term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just tied to that, would M&A make it easier to accelerate that in terms of undertaking that investment, or is it
easier for you to do that and then think about M&A of any large scale?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think, you can look at that either way, Ebrahim. Obviously, M&A, if you can cut costs someplace else, it allows
you to reinvest that. We've seen that with the messaging coming out of a lot of the recent mergers. But we believe
that we can do it within our existing budget today. I mean, when I look at our technology spend this year, as we
shared on the call, we're down in expenses on a year-to-date basis 3%, yet we've increased our technology
spend by 8%. And the large majority of that increase comes in our special projects, where we're able to add
additional spend to drive revenue growth and new client acquisition.
So, I don't think that not having a merger take place is a limiting factor either. Quite frankly, we'll continue to utilize
Synovus Forward to find efficiencies in other areas so that we can redeploy that into the areas that we want to
invest, like talent and technology.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start with the buyback, it's great to see you all reengage there. If you include what you've repurchased
in July, I think you're about halfway there to your $200 million mark. But the stock is cheaper now, I think, you all
repurchased around 1.65 at tangible last quarter, it's now at 1.40 tangible. And to me, it seems like you could go a
little beyond the $200 million. So, maybe just talk about, the pull back in the stock here and if it's possible that we
could see buybacks actually exceed that $200 million kind of threshold that you all talked about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Brady. As we progress through 2021, we've been proactive in managing our balance sheet.
You've seen that both in growth and our lending partnership portfolio, as well as through share repurchases as
you mentioned in the second quarter. As we look forward into the second half of the year, I expect those same
themes will apply along with our expectation for the gradual pickup and in core loan growth, our core customer
loan growth. And that's where our priority is, it's ensuring that our balance sheet is positioned, so that we can
serve our customers best. And we expect that to materialize in the second half of the year. 9.5% for us is not a
point in time objective that we manage to, it's really just a target that we use for medium-term objectives. And
we're comfortable operating above or below the target in the short run.
As you've seen in the second quarter, we were actively purchasing shares. We've been actively purchasing
shares quarter to-date. We believe that they are attractively valued and we will continue that plan as long as it's
prudent. But as we look forward, we do believe that core earnings will provide enough capital to cover our core
customer loan growth and we should remain above target assuming no material changes in the operating outlook,
to facilitate the full $200 million in share repurchase as you mentioned.

Okay. And then, my second question. So, Jamie, you talked about getting the bond book up to 16% to 17% of
average earning assets, you're there and now you're talking about maybe going a little higher. What's the max
that you think we could see as far as how much the bond book could continue to grow here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. And typically when we think about the securities portfolio, the thing about it is
traditional balance sheet management. And this is a unique environment. Right now, we're managing in a time
where our customer liquidity is at levels unforeseen and unexpected and we're managing in that dynamic.
We do believe that this liquidity environment will remain for the foreseeable future and we're managing our
balance sheet accordingly. And we're growing the securities portfolio in a prudent manner at 17% of assets. We're
growing our third party lending. But it's hard for me to give you an absolute level, because it really depends on
what the opportunities are. We've been very specific in what we're targeting. And if you look at the third-party loan
purchases in the first half of the year, they're great examples. They are strong credit assets in asset classes that
we are very familiar with, with shorter durations. And that aligns with our liquidity view. And as we look forward
into the second half of the year, if we see opportunities that fit that profile, then we will continue to pursue them.
But it's hard for me to give you targets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. And Jamie, what was the yield on the third-party consumer purchases this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
The third party purchases this quarter, the largest portfolio purchase, there were multiple purchases in the second
quarter. But the largest purchase was a little more than $300 million in auto loans with a gross yield of a little more
than 5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Kevin, for you, I know there are quite a few initiatives already underway. But with this being our first call with you
as a CEO, could you give us a bit of a deeper look into what you see as your long-term vision for the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a great question, Steven. And look, I'll start by saying, my goal for our company is to win and I know our team
members feel the same way. And similar to my comments earlier in the call, I feel like it's our job to build
significant upside in our earnings power through a set of strategic actions that will allow us to improve efficiency
and accelerate our top line growth. And I know with you, we've had discussions in the past of what that growth
looks like. I think that's directly aligned with what our opportunity is and that we feel like we can build a high-
growth, low-risk bank that can continue to take market share and in a very attractive Southeastern market.
And so, we're building the – and so, I use the word transformation, because our bank is extremely well-positioned.
I feel like we sit in a great footprint, we have a 133-year history of performing. But as I look into the future, I think
there are four areas we have to focus on to be able to be a bank that truly stands out.
Number one is an ease of doing business. It's not rocket science what we do every day. It's important for us to
recognize that our customers want a bank that is easy to do business with, our team members want to come here
every day and have to work, a place that it's easy for them to get their job done. And so, we're investing time and
energy in improving how we do business with our customers through process automation, through our client
journeys where we're going to shorten cycle times and improve the overall customer experience. That's important,
because it leads to great referrals to our prospects which generate growth.
The second area of focus is around being able to seamlessly deliver all of our products and solutions across all of
our segments. As a relationship bank, we believe that we've earned the right to have a deeper share of wallet with
our customers. And that means that we can't deliver in silos, we have to deliver as a team and we feel that we do
that today. But we can do a better job of delivering across our products and solutions and ultimately, increase the
type of solutions that we bring to our customers that will also serve as a source of revenue.
The third area, as we've talked about in the past, is we'll take our high-touch approach, I think, which shows loud
and clear with some of our loyalty scores, and we'll apply a high-tech approach to match that and compliment it.
So we'll bring new technology and new solutions to the table, along with analytics that will allow us to deepen the
share of wallet again and expand our customer base.
And then, lastly, we'll focus on our team members. This is a great place to work and we know that, but there's
opportunities to continue to improve that through professional development and compensation and other perks for
our team members, but also continuing to attract the top talent in the industry.

So, we believe that ultimately, when you bring on those four areas of transformation along with the strong
foundation we have, we think it puts us in a position to stand out in the industry and deliver growth that exceeds
that of our peers and that of our marketplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I appreciate that color, Kevin. That's terrific. Can you realize that vision based on the current technology offering
or do you need that modern core to get you where you ultimately want to be? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steven, I think, over time, I think to be able to compete in the very competitive landscape, we need to make
sure that our technology is at par with our competitors. And so, do I think a modern core is important? Yes. We've
done two proof-of-concepts since 2019. So, I think, we're well on the way of testing that out. The goal with the
modern cores, as said earlier, is just to make us more agile and bring more services to our customers. I think, the
great equalizer in our industry today is fintechs. We believe that partnering with fintechs allows us through the
software-as-a-service model to bring new solutions to our customers, and we can do that without having to have
an R&D shop inside of our bank. And we can do it in a way that's extremely scalable and customizable.
So, for us, it's about things like the modern core, but then it's also about having partners that can continue to add
new services and better solutions for our customers, like our Synovus Gateway product or the Accelerate AR
solution that Jamie mentioned earlier. So, I think, it's modern core, but it's also about having the right fintech
partners to complement that.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Right now, the third-party consumer loans are around 5% of the total, I guess looking at that dynamic of deploying
the cash and with the 10-year down further, could we expect to see that as a percentage of the loan book maybe
accelerate over the next few quarters versus putting incremental dollars into the security book down here? And if
so, how big would you be comfortable with that portfolio you're getting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jared. As we think about that portfolio, I bifurcated into HFI and HFL. What you're referring to is the total
combined portfolio. But the risk profile of the health for sale portfolio is very different than the health for
investment portfolio. So, I going to focus in on the HFI portfolio. As we sit here today, we believe that we have the
ability as far as our knowledge, our experience to grow this portfolio further and get back to that $2 billion pre-
pandemic level on held our investment loans on balance sheet.
What you should expect to see from us, first is this one, we're not going to go out there and chase these assets
just to grow the portfolio. But we have found strong risk-adjusted return in these portfolio purchases and we
believe that we're taking the appropriate amount of risk, which is actually fairly low on this portfolio and delivering
incremental spread vis-à-vis the securities portfolio where you get that spread in duration.
And so, we would much rather take it in prime credit, like a prime auto securities – I mean, prime auto loans with a
two-year duration versus extending out on the duration curve in the securities book. And so, we feel comfortable
at $2 billion. We're not there today, we're not going to chase that number. But that is something where we have
our eye to, and this liquidity environment, there's plenty of liquidity to support that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, circling back down to the capital management side here and it sounds like maybe a little
bit of a reluctance to extend that buyback. What's the thoughts on M&A and what are you seeing, I guess sort of
out there in the market? Are there are opportunities to potentially reengage or engage in an acquisition strategy,
to help accelerate some of those growth goals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared. This is Kevin. I'll take that. So, as we've said on previous calls, we remain focused on investing in
Synovus. And I think, the next $100 million in Synovus Forward will be our top of mind activity at this point. And
we need to be able to deliver those incremental benefits. That's shared in the past. I think, bank M&A often looks
great on paper, when you look at the pro forma financial metrics, but I think there are challenges that are present
with system and cultural integration, as well as just creating growth off the acquired company's base. And I think,
all of those challenges are underestimated.
So, we believe that we can focus on improvements here at Synovus. And with those improvements, our currency
will improve and then that will allow us over time to consider alternatives and options in that bank M&A space. But
for now, I think, the only M&A that we've evaluated or would evaluate, would be smaller companies that provide
solutions or capabilities that would be additive to our existing customer base. And those sort of businesses would
have to provide elevated returns and a growth profile that align with our overarching strategies.
As it relates to what we're seeing, as you know, there's still a very active M&A environment. I know with the
executive order that came out recently, I think, there's been some questions as to how that will impact that

activity. I believe that it's not intended to truly impact the mid-cap space in terms of mergers and acquisitions. If
anything, I think, it will just hinder bank's ability to close branches and may increase the amount of investment
that's required for community development. But I don't think it's going to slow it down.
Obviously, in this low-rate environment, where many banks are challenged and they look at their two- and three-
year forecast, it's resulting in them reaching out to a partner. And that's why transactions are happening. We are
very confident in our Forward strategy and our ability to grow the bank and therefore, we don't feel like we have to
go that route today. .

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Jamie, I'm just curious anything more to do on the right side of the balance sheet, in terms of – I mean, you
mentioned continuing to optimize deposit base, but just curious if there's anything on the horizon that might
accelerate there on the brokered side of things with those time deposits maturing or in the other brokered
accounts that you might be able to change on the right side of the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. First off, we're very pleased with the progress we've made to-date in closing the gap versus peer median. 6
basis points a quarter for each of the last two quarters is strong on total deposit cost improvement. We do expect
to be able to continue to reduce total deposit cost, albeit not quite at the pace you've seen in the last couple of
quarters. Obviously, as you get closer to zero, it gets more difficult.
But we do think there are opportunities. And to your point, there are opportunities in broker deposits, we do have
some of those maturing in the second half of this year even though a larger wave is in 2022, early 2022. We have
about a $1 billion, $1.1 billion, of CDs maturing this quarter, the third quarter, I mean at an average rate of around
70 basis points. And so that's an opportunity for us to reduce deposit costs.

As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, total deposit costs were at 15 basis points for the month of June
relative to the 16 basis points for the quarter. So, we think that we can continue to reduce them. We have
opportunities on money market and non-maturity deposits. And so, we do see opportunities to continue our work
in closing the gap to peer median. And that's just one of our key strategic priorities as we head into the second
half of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, just was going to see if you could just add a little more color to
some of the fee income lines this quarter, obviously that the mortgage is pretty self-explanatory, but maybe down
a little bit more than I saw it? And then, I know capital market is an area that you guys have invested a lot in and
have been bullish on that business, but maybe a little weaker than I thought. But there may be some seasonality,
some other things that you could add some color there as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. You know, I – what I would say is, if you look at fee revenue, it's a great success story of broad-based
growth, which is offset by secular trends in mortgage as well as NSF. And so, when we look at the growth in
wealth, which is not just due to equity market increases, this is due to customer growth, deepening relationship.
We're seeing growth in account analysis and we've spoken in the past about the work being done in treasury on
pricing for value. This is extremely valuable to our company, both as far as just the pure revenue but as far as
also acknowledging the value-add of our expertise in that area. We're seeing growth in card and other core
banking fees.
So, what we are pleased with is, we can't fight the longer-term industry trend in mortgage or in NSF fees, little
liquidity out there. But we are delivering in all of our businesses beyond those with those more secular headwind.
So, we're pleased with the growth, we're expecting that to continue in those areas. We do expect continued
normalization in mortgage. And so, we would expect mortgage revenue to decline in the second half of the year
versus the first. But we are pleased in the broad-based growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brad, the only thing I'd add on the mortgage front, I think when you look at the quarter-over-quarter results,
there's although production was down slightly, there was a fairly sizable shift in the mix over to the portfolio side.
So, in first quarter, about 70% of our production was in secondary, this past quarter it was only about 53%. So, as
you see our production moving to more purchase money, which it will over time, I think, you'll see more move over
into the portfolio, which as a – just to provide background is our private wealth and our physician mortgage
product, and less will go into secondary.
The other thing this quarter that impacted mortgage revenue is the cash gain on sale. And the secondary market
was down in total from around 3% down to 2.40%, which is where we had guided, but it's the very competitive
marketplace, obviously with the pricing of mortgages. And that's an area that we expect to continue to see some
pressure on that cash gain on sale.

Operator: The next question comes from Brody Preston with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brody.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, Jamie, I just wanted to circle back on the third-party loan purchases. So, I think, the guidance that you all
provided around the non-interest expense indicated that it doesn't include any significant changes from non-core
balance sheet activity. And so, I'm assuming that those third-party loan purchases kind of fit into that bucket. And
so, I guess just help me understand, because these loans are yielding about 5% and the step-up that you've seen
in the third-party expense, the run rate on that, kind of indicates that you're bringing these loans on at about a
50% efficiency ratio or so.
And so, just given how yields have trended over the last two months, I'm assuming that it's going to get more
competitive for these type of loans, which might actually push the incremental efficiency ratio back to neutral as to
where you guys are running right now. So I guess, help me understand your thought process around the tradeoffs
between deploying liquidity into these loans, but also potentially kind of modeling the expense run rate from here
relative to the guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brody. Just a few points on that. Our expense guidance for 2021,the down 1% to down 2%, includes the
associated expenses with the portfolio as it is today. And so, our point there is increases from here, because we
have not forecasted those increases, that's what we're referring to. When you look at the second quarter growth
and third-party processing expenses, it's actually a combination of two things. We did have an increase in the
Paycheck Protection Program forgiveness fees, as well as the process or servicing expense associated with third-
party loans.
And so, when you look at these portfolios, the servicing expense varies. But generally, it's less than 1% on these
loan portfolios. You are exactly right that it's a very competitive market and I very much agree with you that it will
only get more competitive as more people look to deploy liquidity. And so, we're very mindful of spread
compression. We expect to see spread compression and we'll just remain diligent to make sure that these
purchases actually add shareholder value. Obviously, with this liquidity environment, we're leveraging the benefits
of it on the right side of the balance sheet, just in line with the prior conversation, to reduce deposit cost, optimize
the mix there.

And so, we're not compelled to grow assets, but we do believe that if we can continue to find assets like we found
in the past that we will pursue that, because we believe it's the right thing for the shareholder. We believe that it's
a prudent way to deploy the liquidity.

That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

You've got it.

Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then I guess, my follow-up would just be on the core banking fees. So, this is I guess is a little bit of a loaded
question, because there's questions within the question. But I just wanted to ask if you could talk just a little bit
more about it, what goes into the account analysis, the nice step up you saw there? And what are the specific use
cases that's driving that growth, maybe from the new products that you've rolled out?
And then on NSF, you mentioned that it's become a little bit of a focal point for the industry, other banks are
getting rid of it. The CFPB seems to be willing to take a harder look here. Just given how low it is as a percent of
your revenues, have you given any thought to maybe just getting rid of it, especially given the nice traction you've
seen in other areas?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Brody, this is Kevin. I'll take the – on the core banking fees, when you look at it on a quarter-over-
quarter basis, we're up 9%, up 41% year-over-year. And you've noted one of the categories. The account analysis
is largely a function of those treasury services that we're offering our customers. Some of that, a large percentage

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
of the increase, comes from the repricing that Jamie mentioned that was pricing for value. And the good news
there is that it was well received by our customers.
Any time you increase fees, you have to question whether it's going to lead to increase turnover or cause a
problem. We saw a fairly favorable response in that we had very few customers try to negotiate that increase in
fee. And that tells us that what we're doing from a value-added advice perspective, is meaningful and so they're
willing to pay for those services.
The other part of that is just the increase in the amount of activity and the number of new solutions and they're –
and whether it's a new solution or existing product that we're providing to our customers, that's also the sales
were up 40% year-over-year. So, our customers are continuing to request and we're offering additional solutions
to be able to deepen that relationship. And so that is a success story. And outside of the pricing increase, we
expect that line to continue to grow, just based on our SMART analytics tool, which about 80% of those insights or
leads are treasury opportunities. And so, our bankers are starting to work those.
The other area in core banking fees that was up this quarter was card fees and that's just an increased spend. We
were up about 11% versus first quarter and 45% versus last year. But inside of that, as we've also made some
investments in our commercial card and purchasing card and that's starting to show up, in that we're able to get
more cards in our commercial customers' hands and so that's a success story.
As it relates to overdraft, you mentioned that we're only about 6% of our fee income that is derived from NSF OD
and that's down about 36% from where we were in 2019. And so, we've embarked on our own overdraft
assistance optimization strategy, where we're evaluating the solutions we provide our customers today. We feel
that we provide a variety of banking options. And for example, we today offer a free checking account and a
prepaid card that allows our customers to access their funds without allowing any overdrafts.
But we are considering some options that will add some new functionality. And more specifically, as it relates to
the bank on-standard that I think many of our competitors are talking about, and that will involve some product
changes and some new digital tools and most importantly, some education. But we'll do that and we feel like
there's an opportunity to do that, in the fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next year.
But to your point, the fact that it represents about $24 million to $25 million of income, where we're looking to
offset any losses that we have there is in some of the businesses that Jamie mentioned earlier, where you see
our fiduciary business which is growing, our brokerage and our securities area, as well as our treasury and
payment solutions. So, over time, we think the growth in those other larger categories will be able to offset any
reductions we have from a new product suite.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a question on the C&I growth in the quarter, can you give us some color on what industries or areas where
you're seeing that growth? And do you expect the acceleration to continue for the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Steven, as I mentioned earlier, the areas that we've seen some growth from an industry standpoint is the
financial services and insurance area. We've seen growth in healthcare, transportation and logistics, retail trade,
and some construction growth. We do expect that to continue for the rest of the year, based on our pipelines and
based on the discussions we're having with our customers.
Ultimately, most of the growth that we're getting is coming out of our metro markets and I think that's where you're
seeing the lion's share of activity. But we're well-positioned and both in this last quarter, you look at just our tier 1
markets, our largest market, it represented about 50% of our production. Our tier 2 markets, which are still large
MSAs, were about 40% and we only had about 10% of our production from our rural smaller market.
So, from those industries I've mentioned, as well as our markets like South Florida, and Atlanta, and some
medium-tier markets like Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina, Greenville, we think there's a tremendous
opportunity and we think we'll grow C&I strongly in the second half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. I appreciate the color in that, Kevin. And then, just a follow-up, just the commercial loan yields, they came
in at 3.86%. I guess, if you were to strip out the impact of PPP, where would that be and if you were to look out
one year and the rate environment remains where it is, do you expect that to trickle a little lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So. Yeah. Look, the way I look at that Steven, is I look at our loans on the books, excluding all fees, the coupon
rate in our portfolio today is about 3.63%. And if you look at our production that we brought on in the second
quarter, it came on around 3.30% to 3.50%. So, you put it on, let's say, mid-point of that, 3.40%. So there will be
continued pressure based on repricing on the new loan origination side, as well as renewals that will continue to
put pressure on the overall portfolio.
Now, the good news is, in second quarter, those coupons were flat with first quarter. So, we feel like the price
competition that we've been seeing from both large and small banks is starting to normalize. And we actually are
widening our spread, when you look at the credit spread and cost of funds, when we look at that new coupon. So,

it is going to provide pressure and that's where as Jamie mentioned earlier, we'll continue to leverage the liability
side, to continue to cut our cost there, to help to mitigate any impact and keep our margin stabilized.
