Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Miles. We had solid performance this quarter as the company passed the $66 billion asset milestone,
and the strong earnings power of our diversified asset-sensitive business model was on display even as we are
keenly focused on the economic uncertainty around us.
For the second quarter, WAL generated total net revenues of $620 million, net income of $260 million and EPS of
$2.39. Record earnings were propelled by accelerating net interest income quarterly growth of $75 million or 17%
from prior quarter to $525 million as the rising rate environment expanded our net interest margin 22 basis points
to 3.54%. Interest income rose 3 times faster than interest expenses, inclusive of deposit costs and ECRs. We
maintain industry-leading performance with return on average assets and return on average tangible common
equity of 1.62% and 25.6%, respectively, which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital
levels in the quarters to come.
Balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly organic growth of $5.3 billion or 52% year-over-year, excluding
the $1.9 billion of loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment, which was done to avoid income
volatility from rising rate models. Dale will speak to this later.
Deposits rose by $1.6 billion or 28% from the prior year as we continued to effectively attract and deploy liquidity.
Loan growth was broadly diversified this quarter with regional banking divisions contributing 16% of organic
growth or $863 million, our specialized national business lines adding 55% or almost $3 billion, and residential
loans composing 28% or $1.5 billion, excluding the held for sale transfers. Deposit growth trailed loan growth in
our $2 billion guide, as a few large customers were pushed to July.
Mortgage banking-related income modestly declined by $5.4 million as the mortgage origination market continues
to face headwinds from higher rates, affordability issues and inventory constraints. We believe the rationalization
of the mortgage sector will take time, but we have already positioned AmeriHome to profitably operate in a low
origination market and to unlock value as a bank-owned mortgage business by attracting custodial deposits and
deploying liquidity into low credit risk loans.
Finally, asset quality continues to remain stable as total nonperforming assets declined $6 million to 15 basis
points of total assets, and net charge-offs were only $1.4 million. We are cognizant of the macro uncertainties and
possibly more difficult credit environment in the future, but we have deliberately positioned the portfolio to
withstand these pressures through credit-linked note issuance, government guarantees, and cash collateral that
now cover 27% of our portfolio. In addition, another 33% of our loans are in low to no loss loan categories.
At this time, Dale will take you through our financial performance.

Thanks, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $260 million, EPS $2.39, and PPNR of
$351 million. Total net revenue was $620 million, an increase of $64 million during the quarter and $114 million or
22% year-over-year. Net interest income increased $75 million to $525 million during the quarter, driven by robust
loan growth and the impact of higher rates on the margin.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Overall, noninterest income declined $11 million to $95 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by a $10
million loss on mark-to-market adjustments for preferred securities as credit spreads widened, and lower
mortgage banking-related income, which fell $5.4 million during the quarter to $72.6 million. But this decline was
partially offset by a $9 million gain on credit recoveries related to credit linked notes sold during the quarter, which
is reported in noninterest income as really a contra expense to the provision for credit losses using the same
CECL methodology.
Finally, noninterest expense increased $20 million in the quarter, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 42.8%, primarily
due to higher deposit costs from earnings credit raises rates rose and processing expenses from a larger balance
sheet. All in, net revenues grew 3x out of the increase in expenses.
Turning now to our net interest drivers, our growing asset-sensitive balance sheet benefited from the rising rate
environment. Investment yields increased 17 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.94%. On a linked quarter
basis, loan yields increased 21 basis points to 4.19%. Loans held for sale also benefited from rising mortgage
rates and increased 85 basis points to 3.99%.
Lending costs were higher with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 17 basis points to 37%, while balances
grew $1.4 billion. Total cost of funds increased 11 basis points to 38%, as the rate and utilization of short-term
borrowings increased as loan growth exceeded deposit growth. Net interest income increased $75 million during
the quarter, or 17% on annualized to $525 million as average interest earning assets grew $4.5 billion and NIM
expanded 22 basis points to 3.54%. With our asset-sensitivity's perspective, our total funding costs, inclusive of
ECR expenses, only grew 30% of the $95 million increase in interest income for the quarter.
After recent Fed actions to rapidly increase interest rates, we continued to remain materially asset-sensitive since
our variable rate loans moved above their floors. Given that the Fed has increased rates by 125 basis points since
last quarter, a proportion of variable rate loans at their floor is now only 16%, down from 80% in Q1. Based upon
expectations of an additional 75 basis point rate increase by the Fed next week, nearly all of our loans will be at
variable rate at that point in time.
In a rate shock scenario of 100 basis points over 12 months and on a static balance sheet, net interest income is
expected to rise 5.3%. Using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet, we expect NII to grow over 25%.
Under a plus 200 basis point rate shock scenario on a static balance sheet, net interest income is expected to
climb by 10.8% in the coming year and over 40% if this rate environment were to materialize when balance sheet
growth expectations are also incorporated.
Our efficiency ratio fell to 42.8% from 44.1% in Q1 due to rapidly increasing net interest income. Noninterest
expenses rose $20.3 million or 8% during the quarter, primarily due to an $8.8 million increase in ECR-related
deposit costs, noninterest bearing deposits, and higher loan servicing and data processing expense from a larger
balance sheet. Total deposits subject to ECR is $14.5 billion at quarter end. We expect our efficiency ratio to
remain in the lower 40s for 2022.
Pre-provision net revenue was a record $351 million during the quarter or 34% increase from the same period last
year, an increase of $44 million or 14% quarter-over-quarter. This resulted in a PPNR ROA of 2.19% for the
quarter, an increase of 9 basis points compared to 2.10% in Q1. Despite our strong balance sheet growth in
volatile rate environment, our PPNR ROA has remained quite stable over time.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for sale â€“ held for investment
increased $5.3 billion, net of the HFS to HFI loan transfer, or 13% to $48.4 billion, and deposit growth of $1.6
billion brought balances back to $53.7 billion at quarter-end.
As Ken mentioned, during Q2, we transferred $1.9 billion of government-guaranteed early buyout residential
loans from the held-for-sale to the held-for-investment portfolio to eliminate the mark-to-market volatility of HFS
loans. Since these loans are targeted to re-perform or roll off the balance sheet in various forms of liquidation,
they have significantly lower duration than other mortgages.
Mortgage servicing rights balances declined $124 million in the quarter ended to $826 million as we optimized
capital through certain MSR portfolio sales. Total borrowings increased $4.4 billion over the prior quarter to $6.1
billion, primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $3.9 billion and the issuance of $494 million in
credit-linked notes, providing first loss credit protection on a pool of $2.2 billion in capital call loans and $3.9 billion
in residential loans.
Finally, tangible book value per share decreased $0.46 or 1.2% over the prior quarter to $36.67, primarily due to
unrealized fair value losses on available-for-sale securities reported in all other comprehensive income. Tangible
book value per share increased by 11.6% year-over-year.
We continue to generate attractive organic loan growth from our flexible commercial business strategy and see
broad-based loan demand between our regional banking divisions and national business lines. Loans held-for-
investment grew $5.3 billion, driven by an increase in C&I loans of $2.9 billion as demand for capital call lines and
regional banking remained strong, contributing $1.1 billion and $863 million to growth, respectively.
Commercial real estate loans grew $969 million and residential grew $1.5 billion, representing 28% of loan
growth, excluding the EBO transfer during the quarter. We expect residential loans to remain at this lower
proportion of loan growth going forward than it has been historically.
Turning to deposits, we continue to see deposit growth across our diversified channels that will generate stable,
low-cost funding in different rate environments through deep rooted banking relationships with our clients. This
quarter, our specialty deposit national business lines drove most of the net deposit growth while regional banking
divisions were flat.
In total deposits grew $1.6 billion or 11.9% annualized in the second quarter, driven by increases in term CDs of
$760 million, interest-bearing deposits of $592 million and noninterest bearing DDA of $201 million. Noninterest
bearing accounts comprised 44% of our total deposit mix.
Our specialty deposit franchises continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to support
loan growth, with deposits from warehouse lending higher by $520 million, HOA up $219 million and settlement
services up $135 million.
Going forward, we expect deposit growth more closely match our loan growth as 2Q is impacted by a few
deferrals of new deposit relationships to the current quarter. Our asset quality continues to remain strong and total
classified assets and special mention loans as a percentage of total assets and funded loans are lower than 2019
levels.
Total classified assets declined $19 million during the quarter to $346 million or 52 basis points of total assets as
the temporary impact of the Omicron variant on hotel loans continues to wane. Special mention loans decreased

$33 million during the quarter to 66 basis points of funded loans and were at historical lows as a percentage of
assets.
If the economic environment continues to evolve, we believe that our portfolio is structurally well-positioned to
sustain superior asset quality through cycles based on our deliberate decade-long business transformation and
diversification strategy that emphasizes underwriting discipline. Our national reach and deep segment expertise
enables selective relationships with the strongest counterparties, leading profitability and superior company risk
management.
Approximately 56% of our loans are in low to no loss categories, and 27% of the portfolio is credit protected
through government guarantees, credit linked notes, personalized protection, or as cash security. We do not
currently see signs of a notable recession or credit stress, better prepared for these events should they arise.
Quarterly net credit losses were $1.4 billion, or 1 basis points of average loans. Our total loan allowance for credit
losses increased $26 million from the prior quarter to $327 million as the provision exceeded losses due to strong
loan growth. And we adjusted economic exceptions for unexpected tail risks. In all, our total loan ACLs and
funded loans declined 5 basis points to 68 basis points, adjusting for the $11.2 billion of loans covered by credit
linked notes were ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party, the ACL coverage ratio rises to 88%.
Finally, given our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate capital to fund organic
growth and maintain well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios. Our CET1 ratio was stable at 9% as our net income
and risk-weighted assets reduction from credit linked notes offset the capital necessary to support our exceptional
loan growth. However, our tangible common equity to total assets fell to 6.1% this quarter, reflecting negative fair
value marks on available for sale securities. It's notable that the TCE ratio does not consider the increased value
of low-cost deposits in this higher rate environment.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.35 per share, our tangible book value per share declined
$0.46 during the quarter to $36.67, primarily reflecting the adverse available for sale mark at quarter end. While
rates have continued to rise, the rate of increase we witnessed in the first quarter and the second should subside
later this year. Given our robust capital generation, we still expect that 2022 will again be a year of tangible book
value growth.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken.

Thanks, Dale. I was very pleased with the Q2's results and the management team's ability to adapt to the
changing interest rate and economic environments. Loan and deposit growth was strong. Net interest growth
accelerated with expanding NIM. Credit remains solid and clean, and expenses were balanced for both near-term
efficiency and long-term investments.
Looking forward, we expect loans held for investments and deposits to grow in excess of $2 billion per quarter.
Our loan and deposit pipeline, bolstered by client confidence, gives us reassurance that our balance sheet will
continue to grow in a safe, sound and balanced manner. Net interest margin is expected to grow throughout the
year, accelerating net interest income growth and driving higher PPNR.
Net interest income expansion in the third quarter is expected to exceed the increase in the second quarter.
Strong net interest income growth will continue to drive total revenue higher, inclusive of mortgage banking

slowdown. Mortgage banking-related income is likely to more closely track changes in overall mortgage sector
volumes going forward.
The bank's asset quality remains solid. We are not seeing emerging delinquencies or defaults within any
segment. However, we believe we are in a technical recession and are planning for a further slowdown and are
prepared for a more dour economy if that occurs.
Regarding capital, we believe our internal capital generation can support up to $3 billion to $4 billion of loan
growth, depending on mix. We expect capital ratios to remain fairly stable at current levels throughout the
remainder of the year. In conclusion, we continue to see EPS of $9.80 for full year 2022 as a floor from which
2023 can ascend.
At this time, Dale, Tim and I would be happy to take your questions.

Question on the funding strategy. The borrowing is up $5.2 billion at quarter end. I know that everyone see short-
term and I think, it's overnight. I was just wondering, are those one-year borrowings? What is the spot rate at
6.30% versus 1.19%? And then what is the appetite? How aggressively are you going to use this going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, it's two items in there. One of them is we have some other credit linked notes are in there, too. But so
90% of it really is predominantly Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings of a short-term duration. I expect that is
basically kind of 100% beta response to what we're seeing.
We are â€“ that our loan growth is also overwhelmingly 100% beta. I do believe that that we're going to see deposit
growth and loan growth really kind of merge in the third quarter, unlike the disparity we had in Q2. So we're
comfortable continuing our growth strategy. And over time, I think that our funding from wholesale sources would
probably wane.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So it sounds like borrowings whole lift level or not included and then potentially decline, if you get good
news on the deposit growth side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think they're going to be trending lower. We have initiatives that are underway and under development on
deposits that I think are going to take hold. I'm not sure we're going to see much of a drop in the third quarter. I
think you're going to see more balance in loan to deposit increases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, Casey. It's Ken. We're trying to balance loan growth and deposit growth, but that's very hard to do. And
sometimes loan growth gets a little bit ahead of deposit growth, in which case we're going to use short-term
borrowings if we think the loans we're putting on the balance sheet are good loans, good asset quality. So while
we try to have a balanced approach, any particular quarter, we could be slightly out of balance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And â€“ got your comments on the NII growth exceeding the 2Q level and 3Q, but can you just give
us a flavor for where asset yields are exiting the quarter, specifically spot loan yields versus 4.19%, and then the
HFS loan yields at 6.30% versus the 3.99% in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Sure. So, we're looking for rates to be up kind of where we're ending something in about 30 basis points.
Again, that's going to get overwhelmed by what we expect to happen next week. And we have dialed in another
50 basis points in our estimates for the September meeting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Remember we're â€“ after July, I think we'll almost be nearly 100% above all the floors on the loans. And that's
going to add a little bit of an extra kick to the third quarter as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. Last one for me. Just big-picture question for you, Ken, you guys â€“ you mentioned that
you're planning for a slowdown. Just wondering I know you guys are a growth story and you've made some
promises on the EPS front and building on that $9.80 in the next year. But just wondering, is there a thought to
maybe get a little more aggressive on the ACL build, just given the overhang on credit normalization for Western
Alliance.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
So, I'd say a few things on the ACL build. I'll give you a smaller answer and then I'll give you a larger macro
answer. But on the ACL build, one, remember that 27% of our total loans happen to be credit protected. So, what
you see in the ACL is also offset in the fee income on the gain there. That's number one.
Number two, a number of our loans certainly on the C&I side have an average life of 26 months. So you're not
going to see a big build there just because of the average life is so short. And on the real estate side, it's an
average life of a little more than three-and-a-half years or so. So we don't have long duration loans that will build
up an ACL or credit loss reserve.
And additionally, what we've been doing for the last several years is focused on these low loss or no loss loans
segments. And when you go back and you look at history for the last 10 years and use that to calculate your
CECL provision, the numbers are very low. So, we moved the provision up from $9 million to $27.5 million this
quarter. You saw we only had $1.4 million of losses. Our special mention loans dropped and our classified assets
dropped. So I think we're appropriately positioned at this time. And I think the other provision will stay around this
number as we go forward, depending on loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think our response to what happened during kind of during the pandemic and what you saw in terms of losses
that we incurred which were almost nil, I think really is borne out in terms of our underwriting strategy with really
significant low LTV. So I mean, the hotel group is just such a good example here in terms of it was a direct hit
from the pandemic. Occupancy rates fell into the low teens and yet we didn't lose a dime in that portfolio because
we came in low in terms of advance rates. We had strong sponsorship with entities with liquidity. And that
pervades the underwriting we do on our balance sheet.
So, I mean, as you know, for the past 10 years, losses have been almost nil. The ratio that we have today â€“ if you
look at the duration of our loan book, as Ken mentioned, under four years and the basis points we're incurring on
losses and then multiply that by four, that would tell you that the reserve ratio would really only need to be a single
digit number. And here we are at 88 basis points excluding the â€“ what we already have coverage on from the
insurance of these credit linked loans.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up, one, I think a few things that you mentioned. I want to make sure
we interpret this correctly. One, you expect loan-to-deposit ratio went from 80% to 90%. You don't see that going
higher given what you said about funding loans with deposits.
And secondly, can you give us a sense of just the pace of loan growth when you think about the third and the
fourth quarter? The resi book is now all the way up to 30% of the total loan portfolio. So would love to hear just in
terms of the pace of the loan growth and the makeup of that we are hearing from others around the slowdown in
capital call line lending as well. So any color would be helpful. Thank you.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. First, on the loan-to-deposit ratio, if we execute our plans to have loans and deposits balance each other
every quarter, then 90% is about the right level. But I will say that there will be some quarters that could be out of
balance and that number could go up a little bit or come down. So in Q1, for example, we had $4 billion of deposit
growth, and that exceeded loan growth. So I think you'll see it float around 90%, but don't be surprised if it should
rise a little bit above that. That's the first thing.
Ebrahim, second question was what again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just the pace of loan growth and the makeup of loan growth now that mortgage has hit 30% target that you had.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good. Okay. Our loan pipeline is very, very strong. And we're talking about credit commitments that we're going
to be making that are straight down the middle of the fairway. They're not different than anything we've been
doing for the last couple of years. We're not looking to steal someone else's market share on loan growth and do
something that we're not comfortable with. And so the straight down the middle of the fairway loan growth is in
front of us. It's going to come from capital call lines. It's going to come from our entertainment and media business
line that we started off.
It's going to come â€“ actually, the national business lines are all showing good pipeline growth and some of the
regions, quite frankly. And so what we get a chance to do here is pick the best of the best credit quality that we
want to put on our balance sheet. And so I think the loan growth will continue to grow. $2 billion is a floor. And I
see the amount of residential loans that comprise the $2 billion to continue to drop. And right now, I would
assume it wouldn't be any more than maybe 25%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. So there's a down â€“ 25% of that growth. And just on a separate note, when we think about core expense
outlook, you talked about the low-40s efficiency ratio is still good. But just talk to â€“ I mean, your NII guidance
implies a pretty decent revenue lift. Give us a perspective of investment spend where expenses are going and
beat hiring, technology, et cetera.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. So our â€“ we haven't stopped investing in the company. We haven't stopped investing both for the short-
term and the long-term. Shorter things, continued improvement in technology, continue improvement in risk
management. We are keenly focused on crossing over the $100 billion asset level and we need to be prepared
for that well in advance. And a lot of our spending is going into tech and risk management.
Additionally, we're spending a lot of money on the deposit side of our national business lines, putting in place new
products and services that we think will be hopefully up and running either at the end of this year or maybe into
the early part of 2023. So that has a little bit more of an intermediate outlook to it. But we're spending on that stuff
today.

Nearer term, you will see expenses rise a little bit and that's because the deposit costs are going to rise. But when
you look at that deposit cost rise in connection with very strong net interest income rising, I think you'll see
efficiency ratio drift off somewhat in Q3 and then come back down in Q4.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. It's approximately half. The spot deposit rates were up about a little less than what we saw in the spot loan
rates. Again, we're focused on is we're not managing betas, we're managing net interest income growth, PPNR
and earnings per share. And so we're less concerned about that. I do think that there is two different kinds of
betas. There is a beta to maintain a balance and then there's a beta to acquire new business.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
And since we are acquiring more business than other institutions, we're going to have a greater proportion of our
growth come in at probably higher beta numbers in terms of the delta. So again, yeah, the spot rates were up
about 23 basis points. And going forward, we expect to kind of continue to drive net interest income as Ken
indicated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And it looks like you added some more bonds in the quarter. Are you still adding variable bonds or I think it
was about a third of the mix in the second quarter or the first quarter. Just curious if that was maintained.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Those were in the early part in Q2, all are 100% beta bonds, basically collateralized loan obligations subject to
only 20% risk weighted assets categorization. And that has basically stopped.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then the CLNs that you did, I presume those were at the end of the quarter and didn't really have a
huge impact in the quarter. What were the rates there similar to the other credit linked notes that you did?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So the rates are basically SOFR plus 600. There's a little difference between them â€“ on each of them that
isn't picked up in the total funding cost beta, I mentioned earlier. But you're right, they were both done in June.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then maybe final question for me. On the loan transfer, I understand we're in the mark-to-market. But
as those loans yield themselves, are they â€“ do they come off your books any differently than they would have
otherwise? Is there something else you have to trigger or is it just goes back the same way it would have if it
weren't held for sale?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. The reason why they're so much shorter is because they had some type of a credit distress. Again, these
are 100% guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. So there's no risk to us. And as a result, you're going to get faster
liquidation. Most of these are going to be sold probably by the current borrower. I mean, they've got a good
opportunity to do that, if their personal situation has changed. You're also going to see a good portion of them
refinance debt now current rates, to put them into probably a lower fee per loans or something like that.
And then also, some of them are just going to go through kind of a foreclosure process. We expect that to be
about half of that total. So those are either going to get remarked to current rates or move off completely. The
balance will probably be adjusted if we perform at the current note rate and those will have a longer life to them.
But half of them are going to have a shorter life. So again, it does â€“ as we said, it kind of avoids the mark-to-
market effects on them and there's no risk of credit.

Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just following up on the credit linked notes, Dale, if you can give us just some color as to how you choose the
credits that these are applied to. I know you gave us the balance of the capital call and the residential loans. But
what's the process in deciding which credits you choose to go the credit linked route versus traditional kind of...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. So I mean, a key feature of this basic strategy is to reduce the risk-weighted assets of these. So we want to
pick something that we can get good leverage on risk-weighted asset reduction. And we also want something that
the expectation of losses is probably low to begin with such that the rates that we pay on the note, this SOFR plus
600, is lower.
And if you had something that was maybe more uncertain in terms of what the credit risk was, maybe that note
rate is going to have to be higher to cover that. So, that's how we kind of got into these. We've seen where has
the trail been placed already? Residential real estate and we did one last year in warehouse lending. We've seen
those before. We're not aware of anyone that's actually done one domestically for capital call lines. But we
thought that would work well, too, in terms of kind of queuing that up and we've been active in that space and I
think it's working well.

Timur F. Braziler Q

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Let me just add one follow-on to the â€“ excuse me for a second, let me just add one follow-on to the credit linked
notes. We went down that path mostly to bolster our capital positions. But I want to make sure it's not lost on folks
that because of the three deals that we've done and the several deals we've done to stock, four deals that we've
done since last year, 27% of our book of business is now insured. I don't think there's a bank that can say we've
13

just done that, we know what we were looking. So over 25% of their book has credit insurance on it. And so the
very important aspect to what we've done really gives us a lot of confidence around our asset quality.\
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
By getting relief on risk-weighted assets has saved us $500 million in capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that color. Maybe switching over to bridge just to see that the lending activity is still pretty
strong. What did deposits do out of that business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So tech and innovation loans just had a very small outflow this quarter of $100 million â€“ just over $100 million.
And year-to-date, deposits over our bridge have remained rather steady. So they're really flat to the beginning of
the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And do you have the warehouse balances at quarter end, mortgage warehouse balances?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, we do. When we talk about warehouse lending, we group it with two other categories because it's run by
the same manager. So we have warehouse lending in there, we have MSR lending, and we have notes finance
lending. I don't think we've ever provided information on each one of those things broken out. And so I would, for
competitive reasons, rather not do that, but say to you that on a cumulative basis, those three groups, those three
things, MSR, note finance and warehouse lending were up for the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just lastly for me, I'm glad to see that I've made it to this part of the call before you get your
first AmeriHome question. But with production kind of being more or less flat sequentially and a pretty marked
reduction in the gain on sale margin, are we nearing the bottom kind of on gain on sale revenue? And then for the
MSR revenue, if you can provide a breakout of kind of what's core versus what was the fair value adjustment for
the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So as we've said, I think almost from day one, we look at everything together and it's mortgage banking revenue.
And I would say that based upon the industry data that we are seeing and what we are seeing in day-to-day
activity, there will be a natural drifting downward from the numbers that we posted in Q2. All that was taken into
account when we provided the floor of the $9.80 EPS guide.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Ken, I want to come back to the $9.80 for a minute and just make sure I understand all the pieces. You
talk about the investments that you're making. You talk about the conservatism you're making on the provision.
But then you say that the NII increase in Q3 is going to be larger than Q2. To me, it feels like that number should
be decently higher than $9.80. And so, I'm interested in some color there. And I think in prior calls, you've talked
about like I think a $2.75 fourth quarter run rate. Just maybe an update would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think, by the way, we started putting out the $9.80 floor number, and the keyword there is floor. In the
back half of 2021, we haven't moved off of that. And while I keep direct you to the word floor, so at this point, we
feel very comfortable at saying that $9.80 is a floor number. There are some upward biases that you could see in
our P&L that could raise that number. And our Q4 number, exiting Q4, I think is $2.75 is not higher than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Is there anything you're doing in the back half of the year just because the NII momentum is so significant
to set up for maybe some expense, the easing of expenses next year since this year is kind of â€“ you're going to
hit that number. Are you doing things in the back half, I guess, to make the comp easier for next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. I mean, we've been running the business for the long term for the longest time. So projects that we have in
place have been in place probably since going back to some of them 2019 and 2020 that continue to be invested
in. So, we're not accelerating expenses to offset revenue, the acceleration in revenue. I think you'll see a little
higher, as I said, expense growth, but just because of deposit costs and the ECR credits, but that will be more
than made up in the net interest income growth.
The provision is something that we continue to look at. And the provision is also predicated upon loan growth.
And again, we're looking at a $2 billion loan growth floor. So, the provision could be equal to about where we are
for Q2 going forward and Q3 and Q4.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And if I could sneak one in for Dale. I know you manage the NII, but one of the themes in the quarter has
been peak margins for the industry, when do we get there. And maybe just interested in your thoughts about the
cadence of the margin, given the futures curve and when you think timing and about where that would occur?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, yeah, we're fairly in the longest leg of this uptrend right now. And maybe that starts to have in the fourth
quarter or first, I do think that there may be a little bit of momentum even after that as, say, fixed rate loans, kind
of repriced at higher levels. We've had this floor strategy that was so successful during the pandemic. But right
now, when rates are moving as quickly the floors fall away from the current variable rate very fast, and they're not
of much use. So I would prefer that we kind of flatten out here for maybe the first half of next year and then maybe
drill down from then. And maybe that's a little optimistic in terms of how fast we get through this. But I think it's
probably early in 2023.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. I wanted to get a sense of the composition of deposit growth going forward. I've noticed most of the growth
in the quarter came from CDs, money market accounts and savings. So I was curious if that'll be kind of a similar
composition for the back half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think it's going to be a little more balanced to our current mix. I don't think CDs are going to be as large a piece. I
think it is probably going to be money market and some interest-bearing checking. I would say they're kind of
garnering real DDA without an ECR in this environment, with a very elevated level of awareness of what's
happened with rates is probably challenging. So I don't think we're going to hold that mix of 44% DDA. But I don't
think it's going to be as skewed to CDs as what you just saw.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And then just broader picture, looking on to next year I noticed comments on the strong pipeline
nearer term for this year. But is there any sort of possibility of slowing loan growth depending on if we get a more
severe downturn next year? Is that a potential or do you think you could continue to achieve this growth even if
we get some sort of a mild-to-moderate recession next year?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Thanks, Ken. Hi. It's a good question. We have focused the whole business on appropriate lending in every
economic circumstance. So there's things naturally that we will do less of as we head into what might be a
recessionary economy, and there's segments that we began adjustments in the second half of last year. So we've
already seen muted volume. In some segments, we will achieve appropriate balance really for any economic
scenario. But we do that in a deliberate way and we do it in advance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. So I get the sense that you could achieve the same loan growth but just the composition would
change. Is that fair to say?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. That's definitely possible. We would generally be less aggressive in stressed economic circumstance. So if
that presents, you'd see likely a little bit less, a little more deliberate and a little higher margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We've been doing this, what I'm about to say, for the last four or five years, but we break loan commitments into a
couple of different categories. The first and easiest one is insurable risk which is what the CLNs are. That's on
one end of the spectrum. On the other end of the spectrum are economic-sensitive loans tied more to the
economy. And so we've been pulling back on that for a while now. And so less growth will come from that. And
then our middle two categories are what we call economic resilience and economic...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, resistant.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
...resistant, sorry. And so we balance what we â€“ we balance our loan growth into those categories to ensure that
we can grow in a very balanced and safe manner. And as I said, we've been doing this for several years now. So
entering into a downturn, there's an intellectual curiosity on our part that I think we prepared the balance sheet for
the stresses that are going to come forward. Tim?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'd like to take you back to one thing that you said when we talked about ACL and it's important as foundational to
the way that we underwrite here. We have a short tenured portfolio very deliberately. We underwrite in the current
economic circumstance. We underwrite within our line of sight. Underwriting to the short tenor permits that. It also
lets us reset those assets that are on our books in an inappropriate way based on the current economic
circumstance. So it all really ties together. Thanks, Ken.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to kind to flip over to the margin question and just thinking out whether it be next
year or 2024, if we get lower rates. Anything â€“ any thoughts around doing anything to protect some of the margin
gains that you're going to generate over the next several quarters in that scenario?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure, sure. I mean, sometimes those are more difficult to climb without the benefit of hindsight. But we would. We
would look for that. We put on a few billion dollars of swaps when we could get term swaps three-year deals or 8
basis points. And that seems to have made sense now, obviously, in retrospect.
So â€“ and there we have multiple ways to do that, one of which, of course, is just to shift the mix of what we're
engaged in. So we maybe go back to a heavier residential component then. We could also put in swaps. I think â€“
what I think is most attractive about our business model is our ability to pivot that we have these different
business lines. And just like during the pandemic when things changed, rates fell, everyone else is pulling back on
credit. We said, okay, let's go to capital call or let's go to residential real estate, really safe assets and we
sustained loan growth throughout that period of time. We think we're in a good maybe a situation, as you
mentioned on the timing, I think it's probably before the presidential election that we'll certainly see a turn. I think
we'd like to be in that scenario and we may play that card again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, sure. So we have some clients on it. I would say that it's still under beta testing of some sort. So we're â€“ it's
not a big number. We didn't talk about it for that reason. We have nominal kind of deposit balances from that
space presently. But despite the volatility that's taken place, we think there's a probably a big opportunity for
stablecoins in financial services going forward.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Couple of quick ones. Can you go back to the message you want us to take away on Q3 expenses, Ken? You
kind of alluded to it, but I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds like you're talking about a step up in Q3
and how material you want us to think through that? How material is that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, expenses are going to rise as deposit cost rise and the impact of the ECR changes that are happening at the
end of Q2 take hold into Q3. And as I said, those deposit costs are going to earn their way back to the bottom of
the P&L through net interest income. And so I guess I would tell you, don't get pulse and always just curious look
at the efficiency ratio here because it will move up in Q3, but it will then come back down to about where we are
now in Q4.
So for us, it's looking at the net interest income that's being generated from interest expense and incremental
deposit costs. As we said in Q2, that was a 3 to 1 ratio. Probably as we go forward in Q3 and Q4, that ratio will
compress somewhat. It won't be 3 to 1, but it should be above 2 to 1 â€“ 2 to 2.5. And so that's what we're focused
on. And just you give me a platform here, Jon, so I'm going to take it. And that is we are just focused very heavily
on net interest income growth and pushing that net interest income growth down to the bottom line and preparing
us also for 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. I appreciate that. And then the last one, I think this is probably a platform for Dale, but in that â€“ your
comments about capital and your TCE ratio and AOCI impact you talked about not marking your low-cost
deposits. Two-part question, do you feel like the TCE ratio, where it sits now, does that limit you at all in terms of
how you run the company? And then the second thing is, what kind of a value would you put on your deposit
base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, I don't think the TCE ratio limits our capacity. I'm sure you're aware there's a number of banks, including some
of the global cities that are a point below us or nearly a point below us. So we think there is kind of latitude there.
Ours have been primarily driven by the AOCI mark. We have had strong growth, but I think that can come down. I
think the kind of the regulatory view, the one that we're focused on, is really â€“ the dominator is risk-weighted
assets. And that's kind of the CET1 level. So, yeah, we feel strongly about that.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2022
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I would say we target at or around 9% for CET1, Jon. And that's what we're more focused on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And that drives us to making decisions about risk-weighted assets, which drives us to the CLNs. It all gets
combined together, which drives us to insuring 27% of our portfolio. So when you take down the waterfall thought,
that's how we think about it when you think about a 9% CET1 ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then any bigger picture thoughts on your deposit base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So yeah, I mean, we've had a number of different initiatives that we've had, I think, strong success with. We've got
some more queued up, and we think we're going to have kind of continued growth with what we've had already.
We acquired Digital Disbursements in the first quarter. We're still seeing that kind of coming to fruition in terms of
accelerating that performance. And we're â€“ our philosophy has been having a strong stable kind of core deposit
franchise really gives you the opportunity to underwrite big credits. And that has to change. That's been going on
for quite a while, a few years.
And we expect that to kind of rebalance with where we've been in loans kind of going forward. So, we're looking
forward to it, and we think this is a good opportunity for us to shine. The volatility is something that we can make
our way through, we think, better than most as we have more opportunities to pivot where appropriately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
