Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Investors and Analysts Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings plc's Interim Results 2020. For your information, this conference is being recorded.

Thank you, Sharon. Good morning in London and good afternoon in Hong Kong, and thank you for joining us. I've
got Ewen with me today, and he will present the numbers in detail before we then go to Q&A.
Let me start by saying that it's been another difficult quarter for our customers, colleagues and communities, but I
have been pleased with how HSBC has responded. This is still a hugely unpredictable environment. We are
conscious of that on both a human and at financial level, and we are doing all we can to support our customers
and colleagues through this very difficult period.
Against that backdrop, we are satisfied with our first half performance. Our Asia business held up well and our
fixed income businesses delivered strong revenue growth. This compensated for challenges in parts of the world
that have been harder hit by the impact of COVID-19. The businesses that performed less well are those we are

already changing. We will be accelerating our transformation in the second half of the year and making other
necessary changes in light of the new circumstances since February.
There's still a lot of uncertainty around, not least from the ebb and flow of COVID-19 and the steps needed to
contain it. Our improved capital position and excellent funding and liquidity are the hallmarks of our strength and
resilience, helping us to be there for our customers while also building the future of the firm. Our focus remains on
helping our customers through this immediate period while making the changes necessary to serve them better
over the long term.
The current geopolitical environment is clearly complex. Tensions between China and the US inevitably create
challenging situations for an organization with our footprint. But our businesses in Asia have shown good
resilience, and we will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our
customers and the best interests of our investors.
Turning to our second quarter performance, our Asia businesses continued to show good resilience, contributing
$3.6 billion of reported pre-tax profit. And Global Markets grew adjusted revenue by 55%. Our profitability was
most challenged in the businesses at the center of our transformation, Europe, the US and the non-ring-fenced
bank, which were severely impacted by high expected credit losses.
Overall, pre-tax profits of $1.1 billion were down 82% and adjusted profits were down 57% on last year's second
quarter. ECLs of $3.8 billion were up on the first quarter, reflecting updated forward economic guidance in the UK
in particular. We've updated our 2020 range for ECLs, which Ewen will talk about later.
The interest rate cuts made earlier in the year began to impact our revenue from March onwards. We responded
by pulling the cost levers available to us, reducing operating expenses by 7% compared with last year's second
quarter. We continue to attract significant deposits in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that our capital ratio
increased to 15%, providing a strong and resilient platform from which to serve our customers and manage the
economic environment.
Turning to slide 3, the resilience of our Asia franchise continues to underpin our financial performance. This was
due to the quality and strength of our business and client list and for the speed and decisiveness of the COVID
response, which allowed many economies to restart sooner than others. The activity underpinning our Asia
performance remains robust.
We've increased our trade finance market share. Clients' FX volumes are lower, but relatively resilient. And retail
card transaction volumes recovered in June, following a dip during the pandemic. Adjusted revenues in individual
markets have been broadly stable despite the economic slowdown. And Asia lending is up 1% and deposits up
7% in the last 12 months. First half expected credit losses of $1.8 billion in Asia included a large single name
provision in Singapore in the first quarter.
Looking to the second half, parts of Asia and Hong Kong in particular, have tightened COVID restrictions in recent
days. This is something that we're all getting used to as cases rise and fall. And we are hopeful that the quick
response of the authorities will contain any new outbreak and minimize the impact.
Looking to slide 4, we remain focused on helping our customers, colleagues, and communities through the
pandemic with high operational resilience in the face of unprecedented volumes and customer interaction. Around
94% of our branches are currently open and all our customer contact centers have been fully operational
throughout. We have now granted around $30 billion of debt relief for our personal lending customers through

more than $700,000 payment holidays on loans, credit cards, and mortgages. More than 172,000 wholesale
customers have received more than $52 billion of lending support, $33 billion of that through government
schemes and $19 billion through HSBC-backed lending. We arranged more than $1.1 trillion of loan, debt, and
equity financing for wholesale customers in the first half, including more than $48 billion of social and COVID
bonds. We also retained our number one ranking for Sustainable Finance Bonds in a rapidly expanding market.
We've invested heavily in technology, driving digital transformation to connect more customers remotely and
increased digital engagement during lockdown. Downloads of our HSBCnet mobile app for business were up
157% on last year's first half. The value of mobile payments in the second quarter was up more than 200% on the
same period last year. And digital wealth sales rose significantly year-on-year, up 44% in Singapore, 38% in Hong
Kong, and 29% in Mainland China.
The strength of our COVID response contributed to a sharp increase in customer satisfaction, with double-digit
increases in several retail markets, record satisfaction scores in Trade and Global Liquidity and Cash
Management, and Global Banking and Markets being voted number one standout FX dealer for global corporates
in the recent Greenwich Buy-Side Study. Throughout all this, we maintained exceptional balance sheet strength
and strong funding and liquidity, with a CET1 ratio of 15%, and $133 billion of first half deposit growth.
Turning to our transformation program, while we slowed progress in some areas in response to the pandemic, we
laid good groundwork for the rest of the year, and we'll be accelerating our plans in the second half. We lifted the
pause on redundancies in June and we'll be moving forward with those plans thoughtfully, but purposefully. We've
already seen around $300 million of cost savings in the first half, with a further $500 million estimated in the
second half from our transformation activities. This is slightly below the $1 billion of transformation savings we
promised for this year because of the pause on redundancies, but we expect to make up the difference in 2021. In
the meantime, we've taken additional action on discretionary costs and we expect to make many of those savings
permanent.
On the rest of our transformation, we've completed the combination of RBWM and Global Private Banking, and
we're making strong progress in the back office integration of Commercial Banking and Global Banking.
As you've seen, the areas of weakness in the second quarter were the areas that we're already committed to
changing. We're confident that the actions we've identified in February are the right actions to take. But we're
obviously looking at what more we need to do given the changed economic and monetary environment. We've
created the structures to reduce RWAs in Global Banking and Markets and made a gross RWA reduction of $21
billion in GB&M in the first half of the year.
In the US, lower interest rates posed a challenge to our US retail strategy and that's something we're looking at.
But the US business has already closed 80 branches and we're on track to reduce US Global Markets' RWAs by
around 45% by the year-end. In Europe, we simplified our management structure and have a new team in place
to push through the transformation. We remain committed to the Europe RWA reduction targets we announced in
February and we'll execute those plans in earnest as the economy starts to recover.
I want to finish by talking about one of the most exciting growth businesses and that's Wealth. In 2018, we set out
a plan to capture the growing global wealth opportunity centered on Asia and we've been investing to grow that
business ever since. In the last 12 months, we've grown our Jade and Premier customer numbers by 6% and our
wealth balances by 3%, with around half of this growth coming in Asia. In our Asset Management business, we've
grown assets under management by 5% and Private Bank client assets by 4% over the same period.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
In June, we launched Pinnacle, which is a new platform to significantly step up our Wealth business in Mainland
China. This allows customers to access a full suite of wealth services, including insurance in one place, which is
unique for any Chinese wealth platform. We're investing to bring our Wealth capabilities to new customers in
China, and we intend to grow the number of wealth planners in phases over the next four years. The Greater Bay
Area Wealth Management Connect program which was announced in June only enhances the Wealth
opportunity. And we're excited at the chance this gives us to serve more people in the region.
With that, I'll pass it over to Ewen to go through the numbers.

Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon all. Given the impact of COVID-19, our second quarter was tough.
We had an 82% fall in reported profit before tax and a 57% drop in adjusted profit before tax. There were a couple
of bright spots. Fixed income and Global Markets was standout together with a resilient performance by Hong
Kong and other parts of our Asian franchise. Overall, our results were heavily impacted by lower revenues from
subdued customer activity in many parts of our business and the building effect of ultra-low interest rates, the
second quarter in a row of very high ECLs and a $1.2 billion software intangible write-off, largely as a result of the
weak return outlook for our non-ring-fenced bank.
Adjusted revenue was down 4%. This included a $507 million benefit from volatile items, which in part reversed
some of the negative impacts we saw from mark-to-market movements in the first quarter. ECLs were up on the
first quarter at $3.8 billion or 148 basis points of gross loans, with the largest impacts in the UK in Commercial
Banking. We've continued to take action on costs to adjust for the weakened revenue environment. Our adjusted
operating costs fell by 7% against the second quarter of last year.
Despite the weak macro environment, our balance sheet metrics continue to improve. Our core Tier 1 ratio was
up 40 basis points to 15% in the quarter and customer deposits grew by $85 billion. Our first half return on
tangible equity was 3.8%, that's down from 11.2% for the same period last year. And our tangible net asset value
per share of $7.34 was down $0.10 on the first quarter due to movements in own credit adjustments.
Turning to slide 9, looking across the three global businesses, in Wealth and Personal Banking, revenues were
down 12%, with Retail Banking revenues falling by $809 million due largely to the impact of falling interest rates
on liability spreads. At a headline level, Wealth Management revenues were broadly stable but, excluding positive
market impacts in insurance manufacturing, down 17% due to lower sales volumes.
Commercial Banking revenues were 14% lower, due mainly to the impact of lower margins on Global Liquidity
and Cash Management, and lower volumes in trade finance.
In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were up 24%. Global Markets grew by $755 million, which we achieved
while keeping traded value at risk broadly stable. This included an excellent performance in our fixed income
franchises, up 79%.
Principal Investments revenue grew by $185 million, primarily due to a material reversal of the mark-to-market
losses we saw in the first quarter. In Corporate Centre, revenues were $90 million lower, with $157 million of
adverse movements in valuation differences on our long-term debt and associated swaps. Just to remind you, all
that the second half usually sees lower revenues from non-interest income in Global Banking and Markets and
Wealth. And given the buoyant Global Markets revenues in the first half, we expect that seasonality to be more
pronounced this year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
On slide 10, net interest income was $6.9 billion, down 9% against the first quarter. The net interest margin was
133 basis points, down 21 basis points on the first quarter of which 20 basis points came from the fall in interest
rates. While we're beginning to see some modest asset repricing, we still expect recent interest rate cuts to have
a negative impact of more than $3 billion for 2020, with a further significant negative impact expected in 2021.
Turning to slide 11, adjusted operating costs were 7% lower than the second quarter in 2019 and down 5% in the
first half relative to the first half of 2019. As a result of the operational impact of COVID-19, we're spending less on
certain discretionary cost line items. We expect this to lead to some permanent benefits in our cost structure
relative to previous planning assumptions. We're being disciplined on variable pay accrual in line with lower
expected profits this year, and we've restarted the cost reduction program that we announced in February.
At the end of June, head count including contractors was down 8,300 in the last 12 months and down 3,800 since
the start of the year. As we signaled at our first quarter results, we're now planning for full-year 2020 costs to be
below 2019 run rate. As you do your modeling on operating costs for the second half, please don't use the first
half run rate as a guide. Second quarter costs were low due to COVID-19 and we expect both a step up in
investment and technology spending and the high UK bank levy due to strong growth in our deposit base.
On the next slide, we saw a further substantial ECL charge in the second quarter, some $3.8 billion or 148 basis
points of gross loans, [ph] $3.3 billion (00:19:53) of which were stage 1 and stage 2 charges. This reflected extra
forward economic outlook charges across all global businesses and regions, particularly in respect of the UK in
Commercial Banking.
UK expected credit losses were $1.1 billion higher than in the first quarter, reflecting the worsening economic
outlook of which $900 million of these related to our UK ring-fenced bank. Stage 3 ECL charges were broadly
stable at around $1.5 billion in both the first and second quarters, although the first quarter did include a
significant charge on a single name corporate exposure on Singapore.
Recognizing the deterioration in the economic outlook in the second quarter, we've updated our range for full year
group expected credit losses to $8 billion to $13 billion. Given the first half ECL charge of $6.9 billion, adding the
current run rate of stage 3 losses for the second half gives a full year ECL charge of around $10 billion. The range
either side of this broadly reflects our disclosed economic sensitivities. The lower end reflects a path closer to our
consensus central economic scenario, reflecting a strong economic rebound in 2021, with some unwinding of the
economic adjustments taken to-date. The higher end of the range reflects the path closer to our downside
economic scenario, with a much more muted economic rebound in 2021, leading to further negative ECL
adjustments for forward economic guidance in the second half. I would caution that there's – remains a wide
range of potential outcomes, including the risk at the upper end of the range may need to increase further. And in
that respect, I would encourage you to read our expected credit loss sensitivities in the interim report.
On slide 13, our core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 15%, that's up 40 basis points in the
quarter. Core Tier 1 capital increased by $3.2 billion. This reflected lower regulatory deductions for expected
losses, FX movements, fair value gains through other comprehensive income, and a reduced prudent valuation
adjustment.
On the next slide, risk-weighted assets rose by $11.2 billion in the first half, or $33.2 billion excluding FX
movements. This was mainly due to our $23.3 billion asset side movement, mostly relating to first quarter lending
growth and also a $16.8 billion increase from changes in asset quality due to credit rating migration. $100 billion
gross risk-weighted asset reduction program is underway, with $12 billion of additional savings from Global

Banking and Markets in the second quarter. We continue to expect credit migration to cause RWA inflation in the
second half, partially offset by progress against our gross RWA reduction program.
So, in summary, a difficult quarter overall. I see bright spots, Asia resilience and a strong quarter for fixed income.
But overall, many parts of the business were hit by very high ECLs and significant revenue pressures. As we look
out to the second half, there remains considerable uncertainty, the continuing impact of COVID-19, the ongoing
Brexit negotiations and US-China tensions and any impact this has on our Hong Kong franchise. As such, it's too
early to discuss distribution policy or medium-term return targets and we don't expect to do so until our full year
2020 results in February.
However, we're pleased that we faced into this uncertainty with a strength in core Tier 1 ratio of 15%, an extra $85
billion in customer deposits, continued vigor in managing our cost base and the benefit of a diversified portfolio of
franchises globally. Noel and I remain very committed to the plan we announced in February, mainly a material
reduction in RWAs, particularly focused on the US, the non-ring-fenced bank and Global Banking and Markets,
with a reallocation of capital towards our strongly performing Asian franchise, a significant reduction in the
operating cost base of the bank, and a material reduction in the operating complexity of the bank.
With that, Sharon, if we could please open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning comes from the
line of Martin Leitgeb, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Noel Quinn A

Hi, Martin.

Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
Hey, guys. Good morning and thank you very much for the presentation and the remarks. And my first question, I
was just wondering in terms of the tougher revenue outlook you're pointing out, I was just wondering what
potential offset could this be. Is there a difference now? How you think about the prospects of some of the smaller
retail franchises you have? And I think you mentioned obviously the revisiting of the US strategy there. Or could
there be other offsets in terms of volume growth or – even more pronounced volume growth like in UK mortgages
or maybe changes in the way you charge for accounts, whether that's current accounts or corporate deposits in
order to try to mitigate some of those revenue headwinds?
And the second question, just on capital. In terms of core Tier 1 trajectory from here, I was just wondering, should
most of the credit migration you're guiding for sort of mid- to high-single digit RWA inflation this year, should most
of the credit migration occur this year or could this also go well into 2021? I'm just trying to look at the numbers
here and the guidance here because it would appear like given your impairment guidance that you're likely to
remain well within the mid to upper range of your core Tier 1 target range. Thank you.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay, Martin. Thank you. Let me deal with some of the revenue offsets first and then ask Ewen comment on that
and the capital position.
With respect to our US business, they actually had a very strong Q2 in the US business there. Their revenue in
Q2 this year was the highest quarterly revenue since Q4 of 2017. I'm also pleased with the way that Michael and
the team have started to execute on the transformation plan. They've already closed around 80 branches, retail
branches on the East Coast of America, which is around about [ph] 60% (00:27:50) reduction and they've been
successful in retaining around about 85% of the deposit base even though they've gone through that reduction
program. And they're also well on track on the cost reduction plans as well where they've already completed 50%
of the planned 2020 staff exits and are on track to meet or exceed the goal we set them back in February of this
year.
So progress on the transformation. We clearly need to understand the full economic impact of the lower interest
rate environment, but we're committed to transforming our business and improving the returns. On a broader
basis on revenue, we're clearly looking at what other options we have to mitigate some of the revenue shortfall
from lower interest rates. And we see Wealth and growth in our Wealth business as an opportunity for that. And I'll
ask Ewan to comment more on that in detail, but we're exploring all options to look at revenue mitigation.
Ewan, do you want to pick up on that and the capital comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Martin, so on net interest income, I think we are beginning to see some asset side repricing, particularly in
Asia. It's relatively modest at this point, but we do think there is an opportunity. Secondly, we are seeing,
particularly in Hong Kong, a changing mix back towards current accounts and away from term deposits which,
again, I think it's not unexpected given the rate environment, but will help alleviate some of the pressure on
liability margins.
On non-interest income, what we're seeing at the moment is very subdued customer activity, which we attribute
predominantly to the impacts of COVID. So I would think coming into 2021, you will and should expect to see
some recovery in that customer activity. We're in some of the government-related lending activity, for example, in
the UK, we've been taking more of a natural market share. We've taken about a 15% share in the Bounce Back
loans, a 20% in some of the other lending schemes which is well above our natural market share in commercial. I
do think in terms of the UK mortgage opportunity, potentially we will be relatively cautious there given the outlook
for the UK economy, I think until we get a better sense of direction of travel on Brexit.
And the other area where obviously we can help offset revenue losses by doing a better job at cost. And I think
you saw this quarter some progress on that. It was an unusual quarter because of COVID and the fact that no one
was flying, a lot of our head offices were largely shut down. But we do think coming out of COVID, there will be an
opportunity to make permanent some of those shifts in business operations that we're beginning to see.
On RWAs, yeah, similar to ECLs, they should peak this year and, therefore, you should begin to get a reversal in
ratings migration into 2021 and into 2022, I would think. Although it will lag I think the trends on ECLs, but we
definitely see a predominant theme in the second half of this year as being additional ratings migration pressure,
which is why we're still sticking with our RWA guidance of mid- to high-single digit growth in RWAs this year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
In terms of what that means for capital, I think second half of this year obviously we don't expect – on the
profitability side, we don't expect Global Markets to repeat their first half performance of just over $4 billion. They
made $2.6 billion in the second half of last year. They – and also, we've got the UK bank levy. And we do think
given the strength of deposit growth that we've seen, that bank levy may trend up rather than down for us this
year.
So we do think that the balance of that and some additional RWA inflation will mean that core Tier 1 should come
down between here and the end of the year. Yeah, previously, we've guided, pre-COVID, at the full-year results,
we guided a range of 14% to 15% for our capital and wanting to be at the higher end of that range during 2021. I
think today if we were to sort of repeat that, we would be comfortable, I think, in a sort of 14% to 14.5% range
rather than up towards 15%.

Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Good morning. Can I just ask you, please, a bit more color on the net interest income guidance? It's sort of
greater than $3 billion. Looking at the disclosure on page 87, the sensitivity analysis, there's been quite a big
increase in rate sensitivity both in sort of year one and year two impact and obviously rates have sort of moved
down pretty much across the board. So, has there been any change within that greater than $3 billion, I mean,
from say maybe just a bit greater to significantly greater?
And just looking into sort of 2021, how comfortable can you be now that that will be the trough year for net interest
income? I mean, are we – it's a little bit hard, I know, to look out to 2022, but would you be confident that some
recovery in volume and asset repricing should start to offset the other negative impacts from rates? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So there's no change I think in terms of net interest income guidance for this year. You do have to adjust
for the shift in dollars, FX movements, but my only caution around that is obviously HIBOR has come down a bit
further in July relative to the end of Q2. That interest rate sensitivity is the interest rate sensitivity from here with
lower interest rate, so it has gone up because of the flooring effect on some of the liability product, but that's if
interest rates shift down from here.

I think you will in some books obviously see a cumulating effect as you can see on those interest rate sensitivity
tables. So, we do think there'll be another meaningful net interest income hit in 2021 as we [ph] currently sit
(00:35:24).
As you look out to 2022, when I checked a few days ago, consensus views on policy rates where they were
broadly going to stay at current levels 2020, 2021, 2022, and begin to rise in 2023. I would hope by the time we
got onto 2022, unless you're complete there, that you would be seeing sustained economic recovery, which
means back to growing loan books again, asset side repricing coming through more powerfully, and therefore,
yeah, the start of a recovery in net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And just a quick second question. So just could you give us any size of – the scale of the
capital benefits that you flagged are coming through in the second half, I think, from the software and SME
changes? Material they may or may not be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, there's a whole bunch of things going on in the second half. We're expecting sort of core asset
growth to be relatively muted. You've got some benefit from the RWA rundown program, which is continuing.
Probably, some modest benefit from – net benefit from regulatory changes, although we have got some offset
going the other way like TRIM in Europe. And the dominant theme, I think will be ratings migration. But all of that
is captured into the guidance of sort of mid- to high-single digit RWA growth. Yeah, software is – the software
intangible is probably, yeah, no more than 20 basis points benefit to core Tier 1.

I just have two quick questions actually. One was just on this NII thing, just to get absolutely clear what you're
saying. If I look at the implied second half from your – from the current run rate. It looks like your second half is
annualizing at around $25 billion. So when you say further pressure into 2021, is that further pressure from the
second half run rate or is that effectively factoring in that pressure you're seeing? So, I mean, are we expecting to

see further pressure from here or are we at that right now and it's just the sort of annualizing effect as we go into
next year that you're looking to highlight? I guess, that was question number one.
And then, the second question. Could you just talk a little bit more about all the sort of US-China pressures at the
moment and in particular, how you expect that to be able to influence the sanctions, have you had some chats
about it, have you had – what's the sort of feedback you're getting from Chinese authorities, et cetera? You seem
to be in a very invidious position through no fault of your own, I might add. But I – just would be very helpful just to
get some sense of how you're thinking about that and how that might sort of play out over the rest of the year?
Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen, do you want to take the first one, and then, I'll take the second one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. You can get there various ways, but if you annualize the second half as you've set out, I think you're sort of
broadly in the ballpark of where you need to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Okay. That's great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On the US-China pressures, I mean, as you see from the first half results, we've had a very strong performance in
our Asia business. So we – and we've had a particularly strong performance in China in the second quarter. I
think our profit in China in the second quarter was up around about 29%. We're seeing strong deposit growth in
our Asia business. Given the deposit growth in Asia in the second half of the year or in Q2...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
$27 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
$27 billion. So, we're not seeing any material impact of any sort on our business performance in the second
quarter or the first half from the US-China pressures. And in respect to looking forward, we're still committed
principally to supporting our customers in all of the geographies that they operate in. We believe there is still a
strong role for an international bank in meeting the needs of our clients if they want to trade internationally or
expand internationally. And we're very focused on that.
And it's not right or proper for me to speculate on what might or might not happen with regard to sanctions. But I
come back to – we've seen a very, very strong performance in the first half of this year from our business in Asia.

Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Okay. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Guy Stebbings, Exane. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Guy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly, can I just ask on Wealth? It was quite a good quarter if we
included the insurance manufacturing. If we adjust for that, I think, it was down around about some 10% in the
second quarter. Just trying to think how should we be thinking about that line going forward, because it seems
there's quite a lot of disruption in that business. But I was hoping it maybe is improving versus the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll give you – a first response on that is clearly new business activity will be down from normal levels of new
business activity. So, you would have seen a rebound in the financial performance because the manufacturing
part of the business had a call back on some of the mark-to-market adjustments that were experienced in Q1, but
new business activity of selling the Wealth products would have been impacted in April and May, but we saw –
started to see a pickup in that activity in June. So, I think that that's what you would have expected to have seen
given the impacts of COVID.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. We've seen some shifts supported by the regulators to be able to shift some of that face-to-face business
to the ability to sell Wealth product through digital channels. But, yeah, 2020 should be a trough year for Wealth if
you believe in an economic recovery into 2021. So – and then other things to watch for are things like the
reopening of the Mainland China border with Hong Kong, which will obviously help as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Pretty good. Thank you. And then the second question just on costs in the context of the NII headwinds
which we've already talked to, and obviously, a very good quarter, down 7%, suggests the run rate could be quite
a lot more than the targeted 3% plus. But you've called out that investments were a bit low in Q2. I think Q2 2019
was particularly elevated. So, just trying to gauge how much should we tempering our enthusiasm relative to the
7% we saw in the second quarter? Thank you.

Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:42:48) second quarter, yeah, effectively, most of our workforce, roughly 200,000 out of
the 235,000 employees were working from home. No one was traveling. Office costs – central office costs were
very low. So, I would just be cautious that using that as a guidance. In addition, marketing spend was materially
down, too, because we took a very conscious decision to market less in the second quarter. I would think if you –
and then offsetting that, I've said we're planning to step up investment spend a bit in the second half. We think
bank levy is probably going to go up rather than down this year. So, probably 3% to 4% down for the full year
feels better than what you saw in the second quarter.

ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Manus
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. I just had a sort of question about the retail business. Your big improvement in NPS is very impressive. I
wonder to what extent is the flip side of weaker returns for shareholders – customers obviously feel like they're
getting a good deal. And you mentioned this, Noel, but I wonder if you could give a bit more detail, how might you
think about addressing that balance between customers and shareholders in the retail business going forward,
such that you can boost shareholder returns and maybe spend some of that NPS improvement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Manus, thank you. I'm really pleased with the NPS performance in both retail and the bank as a whole. And I think
we look at that very much as a positive. I attribute it to two things and that is the quality of the support our
colleagues provided to customers in the first and the second quarter of this year. They really responded
amazingly well with lots of outreach to our clients to make sure they understood where they stood and responded
to their concerns.
Plus, we put in place some new digital support programs to make sure that we had regular dialogue with them.
And they were able to transact despite the fact that we couldn't serve them face-to-face. And I'd also point to the
fact that we provided our customers, particularly in retail, with circa $30 billion of payment holiday support and our
commercial or wholesale customers with around about $52 billion of credit support in response to COVID. So I
think those were the right things to do. And I believe supporting clients at a time of stress is a good thing for any
bank to do.
In terms of translating that into higher returns for the future, we're clearly looking to extend the use of digital and
lower the cost to serve. We're looking to increase further our penetration of the wealth market, particularly in Asia,
and to diversify our revenue stream away from pure NIM or NIM and into NFI sources of revenue. And we believe
that our opportunity to grow Wealth in China is strong and our Wealth in the rest of Asia is strong and that can

lead to higher returns. We're also looking to improve the returns in our retail business by taking down our cost
base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Manus, I wouldn't think the two are inconsistent in the slightest. Improved NPS, where we have the highest
NPS scores, they typically correlate with digital distribution. And digital distribution, as you know, is lower cost to
serve than physical distribution. So actually, I view that improvement in NPS as excellent and reflects a lot of work
that Charlie Nunn and his team have been putting in to improving the quality of the digital offering we've got. And
you saw in the slide that Noel put up earlier, one of the outcomes of COVID has been a very rapid acceleration, in
some cases, by several years in terms of digital engagement from our customer base. Yeah, that's both good for
NPS, but it also should be good over the medium term for how we can adjust and accelerate our cost structure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
So it will be more a question of, as you say, the cost structure rather than thinking about changing fee structures
or anything to help improve the top line. It will be about...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think it's a combination. I think it's adjusting to the new revenue realities of today's world, plus continued focus on
cost and continued focus on providing good quality service. It's a combination of those three things together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, the thing that we are going to have to think about on revenue, Manus, is just in an environment of ultra-
low interest rates, we are not earning a return on your liability product. Yeah, do we need to think about adjusting
some of the cost structure to a more fee-based cost structure, but we're sort of early into that thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah. That's what I was driving at. Okay. I look forward to hearing more. Thank you.

Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions. The first one, just back to NII, I
think I heard you say the first half 2021 run rate, [indiscernible] (00:48:38) broadly correct. So I just want to
understand why that's the case, because HIBOR looks like it's down probably about 100 basis points kind of first
half versus where it is right now. So how does 2H 2020 NII hold up so well in the face of HIBOR coming down to
that extent?
And the second question I had was just on the US-China situation. I appreciate it's quite a difficult question to
answer, but could you give us a sense of how you think profitability might be impacted and where your biggest
concerns are when you think about the kind of political noise coming out between China and the US? Looking at

your numbers, I appreciate you said deposit growth has been strong. But looking forward, where do you see the
potential risk to your profitability from that [indiscernible] (00:49:28)? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Ewen, do you want to deal with the NII question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. NII, we had always assumed that HIBOR was going to normalize towards dollar interest rates in the second
half. So that might be the disconnect in your modeling. But, I don't have the benefit of your model. But I think what
we said is broadly true in terms of the previous answer to the other question.
[indiscernible] (00:49:59)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Sorry. As a follow up to that, I think your sensitivity saw about a 30% increase in terms of the year two impact on
NII versus the year one impact. Is that a decent kind of way to think about the cumulative hit to year two NII or is
there anything to mitigate that size of increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. But I think as you think about that interest rate sensitivity, it's interest rate sensitivity from here, i.e. that
we've already had the first half impact on rates. So it's not a clean read across, I think. So, be careful about how
you interpret that interest rate sensitivity because it's from here rather than where it was at the start of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fahed Kunwar Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On your second point, I think there are – I'm not going to get into speculation on what actions may or may not be
taken between respective governments, it's not my role to do that. At the end of the day, I'm a banker, not an
economist or a politician. But clearly, there are potential impacts on general economic confidence from any form
of trade tensions and that will have an impact on all financial institutions. Clearly, there is the potential for change
in supply chains. And over 155 years, we've seen many changes to supply chain activity over that time and we'll
continue to respond to anything that comes our way going forward.
We absolutely believe strongly in the strength of the PEGs, so we do not see that as a viable risk. We believe the
PEG is strong and is well supported and we see no risk to that. And clearly, there are the potential for sanctions
against individuals or entities. But again, I'm not going to speculate whether they will or won't happen or if they do,
what impact it might have, that's not my place to do so. I think, to be honest, I'll return back to – if you look at the

first six months' performance, it's been mainly impacted by COVID. It has not been significantly or materially

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
Hi. Just a quick one. So you've taken this extra charge, provision charge in the UK and noted the downside risk to
the economy. And I think you've made some similar comments [indiscernible] (00:53:40) Q1 about the relative
weakness in the UK. Can you just help me square the circle? If I look at your mortgage balances, they're up 6%
year-on-year in the ring-fenced bank which is like 2x the industry growth. Can you just help me square the circle
between the two views and whether or not you feel like you're being appropriately paid for this risk given your
caution around the UK? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, I think, the way we're concerned about credit in the UK, I think is more on the commercial side than the
retail side. The mortgage book, if you look at the average LTV of new lending, you look at where their book is
overall in terms of the average LTV, you look at the returns that we're still generating out of that business, I think
we're getting adequately and more than adequately compensated for the downside risks in mortgages. Consumer
debt, credit card spending has declined markedly over the last few months as a result of COVID and I think folks
have been using things like mortgage relief to pay down consumer debt. So, consumer balances have fallen as a
result of that and therefore, less risk to ECLs. It's really on the commercial side that I think we've got more
sensitivity and you can see that in the overall level of commercial provisions – commercial ECLs which are over
$2 billion in the quarter relative to retail. But I don't think the two views are inconsistent at all. Our sweet spot in
mortgage lending is typically prime mortgage lending where we think we are running relatively low risk and getting
adequately compensated.
The other thing I'd say is, you can look at the stress characteristics of our portfolios in the Bank of England ACS
results, what you see there is a relatively strong outperformance in retail and still outperforming in wholesales
versus UK peers.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning. Good morning. Just actually, [ph] couple of them have been addressed (00:56:02). Two follow-up
questions. So if you note the comment on the dividend, could I ask if you came in at the top end of your ECL
guidance? I mean, there is a chance that you make very, very little profits this year. I mean, you could potentially
even dip into being loss making. Interested if your best guess at the moment was as to whether that may preclude

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 03-Aug-2020
you from resuming a dividend in February, if you were indeed loss making, or do you think the strong capital wins
out?
And then secondly, just on restructuring, I mean, is it the right read from the tone of everything today is, you
clearly faced much weaker revenue environment than you thought in February, and it sounds like you are doing
the work on some additional restructuring. You've obviously not provided a new target in terms of cost saves or
RWAs. But is it right to assume that the work is happening in the background, we're perhaps just not ready to
announce something or do you think I'm just getting a little ahead of myself? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Let me deal with the second one first. I mean, we're clearly committed to delivering on the cost reduction program
that we identified in February. We also need to reflect the fact or respond to the fact that the revenue is softer now
than it was in February and we're looking at what additional measures we need to take. So you're right to say that
we're looking at what other additional actions we can take on revenue or cost or capital to improve the returns.
But we've got no details to talk through on that at this point in time. And we have to see how COVID develops
over the next quarter or two quarters to determine how enduring this revenue position and cost position is going to
be. But we're committed to delivering that which we said in February and looking at additional actions as required.
Ewen, on the first point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So maybe just a couple of other things on – I mean, COVID clearly does open up, I think, some opportunity
and time will tell how permanent some of this is. But we talked earlier about the fact that we've seen a substantial
acceleration in digital engagement from our customers. I think that will allow us to think more carefully over the
medium term about some of our assumptions around the mix between physical and digital distribution and also
how we work and seek to go back to work as a workforce, what that means for our commercial real estate
portfolio, what that means for previous assumptions on travelling, et cetera.
Again, I think over the medium term, COVID has opened up a unique opportunity for us to rethink how we engage
and work as a workforce. But as Noel said, it's too early to sort of model that out for you at the moment, and I
suspect by the time we get to full year results, [indiscernible] (00:59:06) what we can say around that.
On dividend, I think it's also – there's two ends of the ECL range, I think signal different things. The high end of
the range means that you're facing into probably other line items being severely impacted because you've got a
more meaningful economic recession going on and a much more muted recovery into 2021. You're also going to
see much greater levels of RWA inflation. So it's not just the impact on profitability, it's also the impact on RWAs,
which means your core Tier 1 is going to be under a lot more pressure.
And at the other end of the range, you're facing a much more benign, stronger recovery into 2021, RWA migration
will be a lot less and you've got a lot more confidence thinking about the outlook for 2021 and 2022 at that point.
So it's sort of speculative at the moment, we don't know. We think we're going to learn a lot in the next six months
on COVID, both in terms of the impact of second and third waves on various economies around the world and the
likelihood of an effective vaccine in 2021, we'll know where we are in relation to Brexit, we'll have had another six
months on geopolitics and I think have a much better grounded view on what are the impacts that's having on our
business, particularly Hong Kong. And that's why we sort of pushed the discussion on dividends to full year
results. But we clearly understand the importance of it to the equity story. We clearly want to return to making
