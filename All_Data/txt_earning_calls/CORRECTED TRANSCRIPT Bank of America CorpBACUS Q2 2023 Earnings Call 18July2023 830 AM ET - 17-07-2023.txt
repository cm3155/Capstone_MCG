Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Katherine. Good morning. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review our second quarter
results. I trust everyone has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They're available on the
Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website and include the earnings presentation that we'll be
returning – referring to during the call.
I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments before Alastair
Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter.
Before I do that, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP
financial measures during the call. The forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual
results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings that are
available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US
GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website.

So with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to you, Brian. Thanks.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Lee, and good morning to all of you. And thank you for joining us. I'm starting on slide 2 of the earnings
presentation. This morning, Bank of America reported one of the best quarters and one of the best first halves of
net income in the company's history. Our results this quarter once again include solid performance on things we
can control by delivering organic growth and operating leverage.
We did that when economies remains healthy and had a slowing rate of growth. It was also a quarter that
included volatility from the debate about the debt ceiling, continuation of central bank monetary tightening action,
and a slowing in consumer spending and a slowing inflation. But as you look at it now, our customer spending
pattern is now more consistent with a pre-pandemic lower growth, lower inflation economy.
Before Alastair takes you through the details, let me summarize Bank of America's quarter two performance. On
slide 2, you can see the highlights. We earned $7.4 billion after-tax and grew earnings per share 21% over the
second quarter of 2022. All business segments performed well, and I want to thank all my teammates for doing
so.
We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered our eighth straight quarter of
operating leverage, led by 11% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet
improving our common equity Tier 1 ratio more than 110 basis points year-over-year to 11 6%. And we have $867
billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We also produced strong returns for our shareholders, with a return on tangible
common equity of 15.5%, continuing a streak of many quarters at that level or above.
While our business has performed well this quarter, I would particularly highlight our Global Markets and Sales
and Trading team and our Investment Banking teams. Both have appeared to outperform their industry peers.
Investments made over the past couple years in Global Markets capabilities under Jimmy DeMare's leadership,
as well as Matthew Koder's leadership in the Corporate – Global Corporate & Investment Banking area allow us
to improve our market share for both of these fee pools. I'd also note the strong contribution by our middle-market
clients and our teammates there led by Wendy Stewart.
I'd also like to touch a few additional points before turning the call over to Alastair. These points will help illustrate
continued investment in the franchise and work we do to drive growth. Let's start with the organic growth slide, on
page 3.
On that page, we highlight some of the important elements of organic growth. And you see evidence in every
business segment as you look at the page. In Consumer, in quarter two, we opened 157,000 net new checking
accounts. Consumer had – now had 18 straight quarters of positive net new checking account growth. Now these
are core primary checking accounts across the board, allowing our tremendous deposit franchise to continue to
prosper and take market share.
While the progress may appear inchmeal, over the last three years, we've grown our core customers in Consumer
checking account customers from 33 million to 36 million. We opened another 1 million plus credit card accounts
this quarter and have 10% more investment accounts this year than we did last year in the Consumer business.
Consumer investment business balances in the – reached a new high of $387 billion, aided by a 30% increase in

new funded Consumer investment accounts year-over-year and, frankly, moving our money from our deposits into
the market as they have done so.
In Global Wealth, we added 12,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the Private Bank. And our advisors
opened more than 36,000 new banking relationships in the quarter, showing a strong differentiation in our model
of fulfilling both investors and banking needs for clients. In the past 90 days, we added 190 experienced advisors
to our sales force in addition to digital capabilities to help us deliver at scale.
In Global Banking, we added clients and increased the number of solutions per relationship. Over the past three
years, we've added net new relationships managers and increased our client-facing head count by nearly 10%.
We've also improved our tools for prospect callings though investments in technology and it's benefiting our ability
to add customers and improve our solutions per existing client. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,000 new
Commercial and Business Banking clients across the United States, which is the same number we added in the
full year of last year. Again, operationalizing that ability to do this at scale increases our speed of onboarding
these clients.
In our Global Markets area, we saw one of the highest second quarters for sales and trading in our history. So
another quarter of good organic growth. To achieve that growth, we're managing our expense trajectory, which
Alastair is going to cover. It requires inherent efficiency progress from digital and other applied technology across
all our units.
Digital superiority is key to our operating dynamics. First, it produces a great customer experience, resulting in
strong customer retention and strong customer scores. Second, it ensures our position as the lead transactional
bank for our customers, whether they're consumers, companies, or investors. Third, it preserves a strong deposit
balance as a good price and do the core nature of transactional deposits. And last, but importantly, it leads to
efficiency.
So how we're doing on digital progress? You can see that on slide 4 and, first, with the Consumer. In Consumer,
we now have 46 million active users that are digitally engaged with our digital platform and are logging over 1
billion times a month. And even with this scale, the stage and maturity of logins is up double digits from last year.
Customer uses of Erica continues to beat expectations. This was an early application of natural language
processing and artificial intelligence that we built in our company and it continues to learn about it with additional
use. Interactions with Erica rose 35% in just the past year and now has crossed over 1.5 billion client interactions
in the first five years of introduction. There's a lot of questions about artificial intelligence out there, but one can't
kludge together a series of systems. We have to build a system in this highly regulated, high customer-focused
business, and Erica is one such application and you can see its impact.
Likewise, Zelle hasn't slowed down either. The number of people using Zelle grew 19% this past year.
Remember, these aren't new functionalities at this point. They've been around for years. But they continue to
grow very strong growth rate, showing customer desire and acceptance in the activities. You can see the digital
sales continue to grow. We continue to have both great high tech and high touch options.
As part of that, we've added 310 new financial centers since 2019. And by the end of this year, we have
refurbished every one of our existing centers in our company. We plan on opening 50 more centers a year for the
next few years, which includes an expansion of nine new markets we announced a few years ago – a few weeks
ago, excuse me. Our entrance to these markets is enhanced by digital and leads to strong early success. Just to
give you a point of reference, for all the expansion markets over the last several years, for branches opened a

year or more in those expansion markets, our average deposit balances per those branch are $160 million in
each branch.
If you go to the Wealth Management digital, on slide 5, you can see that they continue to be the most digitally
engaged clients in our company. Our advisors have led the way in driving a personal-driven advice model
supplemented by our digital tools. You can see the client adoption rate of 83% in Merrill and 92% in the Private
Bank. 78% have embraced digital delivery as a tool service, providing even more convenience for them and our
advisors. Erica and Zelle also continue to expand in these client sets. A new program we announced just a few
quarters ago has generated 20,000 digital leads to 7,000 advisors. It's called Advisor Match, matching our clients
with advisors of their choice.
On slide 6, you can see the digital engagement in the Global Banking area. Corporate treasurers – Corporate
Treasury teams and our clients appreciate the ease of doing business with us digitally. CashPro app sign-ins are
up 60% from last year, where the value of payments through CashPro app are up 20%. As you can see, every
line of business is just delivering strong organic growth. The investments made in technology have enabled us to
grow industry-leading positions in digital tools, while enabling our clients to do great things and making us more
efficient. This provides for a very satisfied, stable customer and client base with Bank of America as a primary
provider. And by doing it with a digital application, that also produces operating leverage.
On slide 7, you can see our streak of operating leverage continued in the second quarter of 2023. We're now back
at eight quarters in a row. The chart on slide 7 covers eight-and-a-half years, or 34 quarters. In all, but eight of
those quarters, and you can see those identified, six of which were in the heart of the pandemic, we've achieved
operating leverage. Operating leverage is that simple task of growing revenue at a better growth rate than
expense. As I said, Alastair is going to discuss with you our good and declining expansion trajectory, which sets
us up to continue to provide operating leverage even with a shifting economy.
In sum, in the quarter, we delivered earnings that are 19% higher and a 15% return on tangible common equity
that was driven by continued strong organic growth and operating leverage in a volatile economic environment.
Alastair is going to talk to you about a bit more strength we see ahead in our net interest income for the balance
of the year, and that provides a better start as we think about 2024. You're going to hear our expectations for the
quarterly decline in expenses in the following quarters for the rest of 2023, even as we keep investing. And you
hear about the resilience of credit and strong trajectory of capital. This all positions us well to continue both our
streaks of organic growth and operating leverage.
With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.

Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian. And on slide 8, we list the more detailed highlights of the quarter, and then slide 9 presents the
summary income statement. So I'm going to refer to both of those. For the quarter, we generated $7.4 billion in
net income and that resulted in $0.88 per diluted share. Our year-over-year revenue growth of 11% was led by a
14% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 10% increase in sales and trading results ex-DVA.
Revenue was strong and it included a few headwinds, and I thought I'd go through those headwinds first. We had
lower service charges from both higher earnings credit rates on deposits for Commercial clients and the policy
changes we announced in late 2021 to lower our insufficient funding overdraft fees for our Consumer customers.
The good news on the Consumer piece is year-over-year comparisons get a business easier starting next quarter,
as the third quarter of 2022 reflects the full first quarter of these changes.

Second, we had lower asset management and brokerage fees as a result of the lower equity and fixed income
market levels and market uncertainty that impacted transactional volumes compared to a year-ago quarter. Third,
we had a net DVA loss of $102 million in this quarter compared to a gain in DVA of $158 million in the second
quarter a year ago. We also recorded roughly $200 million in securities losses as we closed out some available-
for-sale security positions and their related hedges, and we put the proceeds in cash.
Lastly, and just as a reminder, our tax rate benefits from ESG investments and those are somewhat offset by
operating losses on the ESG investments, which show up in other income. So this quarter our tax rate is a little bit
lower and the operating losses are a little bit higher from volume of these deals. So you have to be careful on
analyzing the lower tax rate without considering the operating losses, and that in turn often offsets what would
have been higher revenue elsewhere.
Our tax rate for the full year is expected to benefit by 15% as a result of the ESG investment tax credit deals. And
absent these credits, our effective tax rate would still be roughly 25%, and we continue to expect a tax rate of
10% to 11% for the rest of 2023.
Expense for the quarter of $16 billion included roughly $276 million in litigation expense, which was pushed higher
this quarter by the agreements announced last week with the OCC and the CFPB on consumer matters. Asset
quality remains solid and provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, consisting of $869 million in net
charge-offs and $256 million in reserve build. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs
toward pre-pandemic levels, and it's still below historical levels. The charge-off rate was 33 basis points, and
that's only 1 basis point higher than the first quarter and still remains well below the 39 basis points that we last
saw in Q4 of 2019, when, remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low.
I'd also use slide 9 just to highlight returns, and you can see we generated 15.5% return on tangible common
equity and 94 basis points return on assets.
Let's turn to the balance sheet, starting on slide 10, and you can see our balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.1
trillion, declining $72 billion from the first quarter. A $33 billion, or 1.7% reduction in deposits, closely matched a
$41 billion decline in securities balances through pay-downs from the hold-to-maturity and sales of available-for-
sale securities. Securities are now down $177 billion from quarter two 2022. Cash levels remained high at $374
billion, and loans grew $5 billion.
As Brian noted, our liquidity remained strong with $867 billion of liquidity, up modestly from the first quarter of
2023, and still remains nearly $300 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019 level.
Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion from the first quarter, as earnings were only partially offset by capital
distributed to shareholders. AOCI decreased by $2 billion driven by derivatives valuation, and AFS securities
values were little changed. So there's little change in the AOCI component that impacts regulatory capital.
Tangible book value is up 10% per share year-over-year.
During the quarter, we also paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $550 million in shares
to offset our employee awards. And last week, we announced the intent to increase our dividend by 9% beginning
in the third quarter.
Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $190 billion from March 31, and the ratio of CET1
improved more than 20 basis points to 11.6%, once again adding to the buffer over our 10.4% current

requirement, while our risk-weighted assets increased modestly in the quarter. Also noteworthy on July 3, we
initiated dialogue with the Fed to better understand our CCAR exam results, and the remaining discussions today
with no news to update as of now.
In the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by more than 110 basis points, and we've done that while
supporting clients for loan demand and returned $11.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders.
Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, and that leaves us plenty of
capacity for balance sheet growth. Finally, the TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements.
So let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances. You can see those on slide 11. And there you can
see average loans grew 3% year-over-year. The drivers of loan growth are much the same. Consumer credit card
growth is strong, and then commercial loans grew 4%. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing,
enhanced offers, and higher levels of accounts openings over time. And in commercial, we saw a little bit of a
slowdown this quarter, driven by higher pay-downs from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to
any credit availability from us. We are still open for business for loans.
Now, while loan growth has slowed, it's generally remained still ahead of GDP, and Commercial client
conversations remain solid, as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before
borrowing further.
Slide 12 shows the breakout of deposit trends. That's on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters, and
it's the same chart that we provided last quarter. In the upper left, you see the trend of total deposits. We ended
the second quarter at $1.88 trillion, down 1.7%, with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability.
Given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in Q2 and the monetary policy actions, we believe
this is a good result.
I want to use the other three charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter and more
specifically in each line of business. In Consumer, looking at the top right chart, you see the difference in the
movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest-checking accounts and the higher
yielding non-checking accounts. Here you can also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balances in
consumer investments and CD balances, and they're both broken out here. In total, we've got still more than $1
trillion in high-quality consumer deposits, which remains $274 billion above pre-pandemic levels.
In the second quarter, that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments, higher spend, and
seasonal tax activity, and some non-checking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts. We
did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly $40 billion of CDs, as some of the financial
institutions pushed prices higher. And at this point, with deposits far exceeding our loans, we've not yet felt the
need to chase deposits with rate. Broadly speaking, average deposit balances of our consumers remain at
multiples of their pre-pandemic level, especially in the lower end of our customer base.
Total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to 22 basis points and remains low relative to Fed funds,
driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's 10 basis point rate increase remains
concentrated in those CDs and consumer investment deposits, and together those represent only 11% of our
consumer deposits.
Turning to Wealth Management, this business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most
relative rate movement, because these clients tend to have the most excess cash. The previous quarter's trend of
clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits, and moving off-

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
balance sheet onto other parts of the platform seem to stabilize this quarter, and our sweep balances were more
modestly down at $72 billion.
At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposit stability. We ended the second quarter at $493 billion, down
$3 billion from the first quarter. We've now been in this $490 billion to $500 billion range for the past several
quarters. And these are generally the transactional deposits of our Commercial customers that they use to
manage their cash flows. And while the overall balances have been stable, we've continued to see shift towards
interest bearing as the Fed raised rates one more time during the quarter before pausing in June. Non-interest-
bearing deposits were 40% of their deposits at the end of the quarter.
Focusing for a moment on average deposits, using slide 13, I really only have one additional point to make. While
you've seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters as the Fed has removed some
accommodation, we just want to note that deposits remain 33% above the fourth quarter 2019 pre-pandemic
period. And as you look at the page, every segment relative to pre-pandemic is up, at least, 15%. Consumers up
40%. Consumer checking is up more than 50%. And as noted, Global Banking has been right around $500 billion
for the past five quarters, and it remains 31% above pre-pandemic.
So let's move to slide 14, and we'll continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of
excess deposits above loans. In the top left, note the balances in the second quarter of each year since the
pandemic began. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $500 billion pre-pandemic to a
peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see, it remains high at the end of June at $826 billion. In
the top right, note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased across time in line with excess
deposit trend. And you'll also note the mix shift over time.
This excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown, with roughly
50% fixed, longer-dated, held-to-maturity securities and the rest has been held in shorter-dated, available-for-sale
securities and cash. Cash and the shorter-dated AFS securities combined was $516 billion at the end of the
quarter. And cash at $375 billion is more than twice what we held pre-pandemic, and you should expect to see
that come down over time.
We made these investments given the mix and transactional nature of our customers' deposits, particularly given
the excess deposits built. Note, also in the bottom left chart, the combined cash and securities yields continued to
expand this quarter and remain meaningfully wider than the overall deposit rate paid. That's the result of two
things. Securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of 2021 when we stopped adding to it. With less
loan funding needs, proceeds from security pay-downs have been deployed into higher yielding cash. And
through this action, and the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen further and
faster than deposit rates.
Deposits at the end of the quarter were paying 124 basis points, while our blend of cash and securities has
increased to 319 basis points. So over the past year, the deposit cost has risen by 118 basis points, and the cash
and securities yield has improved by 164 basis points. And as a reminder, this slide focuses on the banking book,
because our Global Markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded.
Finally, one very last – one last very important point that I want to make is on the improved NII of our banking
book. The NII, excluding Global Markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at
$9.1 billion, and that compares to $14 billion in the second quarter of 2023, so almost $5 billion higher on a
quarter basis, $20 billion per year. That's led to a stronger capital position even as we returned capital to
shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
And then, more specifically, on the hold-to-maturity book, the balance of that portfolio declined again $10 billion
from the first quarter. It's down $69 billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of 2021. The
market valuation on our hold-to-maturity book, which is in a negative position, worsened $7 billion since March 31,
2023, driven by a 54 basis point increase in mortgage rates. The OCI impact from the valuation of our hedged
AFS book modestly improved this quarter.
Let's turn to slide 15, and we can focus on net interest income. On a GAAP or non-FTE basis, NII in the second
quarter was $14.2 billion. And the fully tax equivalent NII number was $14.3 billion. So I'm going to focus on that
fully tax equivalent. Here, NII increased $1.7 billion from the second quarter of 2022 or 14%, while our net interest
yield improved 20 basis points to 2.06%. This improvement has been driven by rates, which includes securities
premium amortization, partially offset by Global Markets activity, and a $137 billion of lower average deposit
balances. Average loan growth during the period of $32 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement.
Turning to a linked quarter discussion, NII of $14.3 billion is down $289 million, or 2% from the first quarter, and
that's driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest bearing,
partially offset by one additional day of interest in the period. Global Markets NII increased during the quarter. The
net interest yield fell 14 basis points in the quarter, driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash
positioning we chose and some higher funding costs. This quarter's compression we believe was just a little
anomalous driven by our decision in late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels.
Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at
June 30 was unchanged from March 31, 2023, at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our
banking book, and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline
forecast. And 95% of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was
unchanged at negative $3.6 billion.
Let me give you a few thoughts on NII as we look forward. We still believe NII for the full year will be a little above
$57 billion, which would be up more than 8% from full year 2022. And this could include third quarter at
approximately the same level as second quarter, so think $14.2 billion, $14.3 billion, and then fourth quarter
somewhere around $14 billion. That's a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth
quarter, with a little more stability closer to the second quarter level and therefore, provides a better start point for
2024.
So let's talk through the caveats around our NII comments. First, it assumes that interest rates in the forward
curve materialize and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card. On deposits, we're expecting
modestly lower balances led by Consumer, and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from Global
Banking deposits into interest bearing. The past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook
around NII, given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits, as well as better pricing. And now we'll
see how the rest of the year plays out.
Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use slide 16 for that discussion. Second quarter expenses were $16 billion.
That was down $200 million from the first quarter. And as I mentioned, the second quarter included $276 million
of litigation expense. In addition, we also saw a little higher revenue-related expense driven by our sales and
trading results. Those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first quarter seasonal elevation of
payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall full-time head count.

Now, excluding the 2,500 or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months, our
full-time head count was down roughly 4,000 from the first quarter start point to 213,000. That's some good work
after peaking at 218,000 in January. Our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter and, hopefully, many will
return as full-time associates next summer. And at the same time, in Q3, we welcomed back about 2,600 new full-
time hires as college grads, many of whom interned with us last summer. And that's a very diverse class of
associates who are excited to join the company.
As we look forward to next quarter, we would expect the third quarter expense to more fully benefit from the
second quarter head count reduction, even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for client-facing positions.
Additionally, the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of
Silicon Valley and Signature Banks could add $1.9 billion expense for us, $1.5 billion after-tax, and we just remain
unsure at this point of timing to record that expense.
Let's now move to credit, and we'll turn to slide 17. Net charge-offs of $869 million increased $62 million from the
first quarter, and the increase was driven by credit card losses, as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through
the charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.6% in Q2 and remains well below the 3.03%
pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Provision expense was $1.1 billion in Q2, and that included a $256 million further reserve build. That's driven by
loan growth, particularly in credit card, and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues
to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% in 2024.
On slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. On
Consumer, we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom, and they remain below
historical averages. Overall, Commercial net charge-offs were flat from first quarter. And within Commercial, we
saw a decrease in C&I losses that was offset by an increase in charge-offs related to Commercial real estate
office exposures.
As a reminder, Commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than 2% of our total loans, and this
is an area where we've been quite intentional around our client selection, portfolio concentration, and deal
structure over many years. And as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that are quite low for this
portfolio.
In the second quarter, we experienced $70 million in charge-offs on office exposure to write down a handful of
properties where the LTV has deteriorated. Our charge-offs on office exposures were $15 million in the first
quarter. We pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for
you. And we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current
conditions.
Moving to the various lines of business and their results, starting on slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the
quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its ninth consecutive
quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in our future. Note that top line revenue grew
15%, while expense rose 10%. These segment results include the bulk of the impact of the costs of the regulatory
agreements from last week.
Our reported earnings were strong in both periods at $2.9 billion. It understates the success of the business,
because the prior year included reserve releases, while we built reserves this quarter for card growth. PPNR grew
21% year-over-year even with the added cost of the agreements, and the revenue growth overcame a decline in

service charges that I noted earlier. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and
card accounts, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier.
In addition to the litigation noted, expense reflects the continued business investments for growth. And as you
think about this business, remember much of the company's minimum wage hikes and the mid-year increased
salary and wage moves in 2022 impact Consumer Banking the most, and that therefore impacts the year-over-
year comparisons.
Moving to Wealth Management on slide 20, we produced good results, earning a little less than $1 billion. These
results were down from last year, as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower
equity, lower fixed income markets, and some market uncertainty impacting transactional volume. Those fees
were complemented by the revenue from a sizable banking business, and that remains an advantage for us.
As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see strong organic growth and produced solid
client flows of $83 billion since the third – since the second quarter 2022. Our assets under management flows of
$14 billion reflect a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expenses
reflect lower revenue-related incentives and also reflect continued investments in the business as we add
financial advisors.
On slide 21, you see the Global Banking results, and this business produced very strong results with earnings of
$2.7 billion, driven by 29% growth in revenue to $6.5 billion. Coupled with good expense management, this
business produced strong operating leverage.
Our Global Transaction Services business has been robust. We've also seen a higher volume of solar and wind
investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish
environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans
in the prior-year period.
We saw modest loan growth on average year-over-year and linked quarter, the utilization rates declined, and
more generally, we saw lower levels of demand. As we noted earlier, the deposit flows have stabilized in the $490
billion to $500 billion over the past several quarters, reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships.
The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, growing 7% over the prior
year, and 4% linked quarter, a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fees pulls down 20% year-
over-year. Provision expense declined year-over-year, as we built more reserve in the prior year. Expense was
held relatively flat year-over-year even as we drove strategic investments in the business, including relationship
management hiring and technology costs. And additionally, comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated
expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of 2022.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 22, the team had another strong quarter with earnings growing to $1.2
billion, driven by revenue growth of 14%. And I'm referring to results, excluding DVAs, we normally do. The
continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central banks changing monetary policies around the
globe, along with this quarter's debt ceiling concerns continued to impact both the bond and equity markets. And
as a result, it was a quarter where we saw a strong performance in both our macro and micro trading business.
The investments made in the business over the past two years continued to produce favorable results. Year-over-
year revenue growth benefited from strong sales and trading results and the absence of marks on leveraged
finance positions the last year.

Focusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA, revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved
18%, while equities was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Year-over-year expense increased
8%, primarily driven by investments in the business and revenue-related costs, partially offset by the absence of
regulatory matters in the second quarter of 2022.
Finally, on slide 23, All Other shows a loss of $182 million. Revenue included $197 million of losses on securities
sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the
company. As a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume and their associated related operating
losses, our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower at 8%. But excluding ESG and any other discrete tax
benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%.
So with that, let's stop there, and we'll open it up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Brian, and good morning, Alastair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Brian, can you give us a view from your standpoint of the new – well, I shouldn't say new, but the speech by Vice
Chair Barr about the likelihood of capital ratios going up for large banks like your own? And then second, there
was a report today on Bloomberg that the capital requirements for holding residential mortgages may go up
meaningfully. Any thoughts on that as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think – broadly stated, I think, as was said by many people that have held the position over the years, the capital
in the industry is sufficient, and I think there's been a desire to finish up the Basel III. Those rules will come out,
we think, in a few weeks, and like anything else, we'll deal with them. We have 11.6% CET1 ratio. Our
requirements currently are 10.4%. And so we got plenty of capital, and it's built up.
So, I think from a global competitive standpoint, we've got to be careful here, because the US industry is the best
industry in the world and actually does a lot of good for all the countries in the world including the US. And frankly,
the rules that apply tend to be more favorable to those outside our country. And so we got to be careful to
maintain a competitive parity. But at the end of the day, Gerard, we need to finish this and get this behind us, and
then the industry will adopt and move forward.

But they've got to think through the downside of some of these rules and that they could push stuff outside the
industry to non-banks that have the asset classes across the board are non-banks including mortgage lending,
which you referenced, half of it goes through non-banks. And those – the resilience of those institutions is
interesting to watch through cycles.
And then second thing to have to worry about is competitiveness overall, and then also just slowing down the
economy. A 10% increase in our capital levels would disable us from making about $150 billion of loans at the
margin. And you want our banks to support the economy like we do. So I think all this has to be balanced out as
they go to adopt these rules.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, Alastair, you talked about the balance sheet. I think you said 100 basis point
increase would lead to over $3 billion in net interest revenue growth over the next 12 months, and 100 basis point
decrease would lead to a decline of just over $3 billion in revenue. Can you share with us, when do you think you
might change? What would make you change that position to be liability-sensitive? Would you rely on the forward
curve? Or what's the outlook for the balance sheet management that you're looking at now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, Gerard, I don't think much has changed for us. We've talked about the fact that, for us, it's this idea of
balance that's key. And if you look at our disclosures around interest rate risk over the course of the past couple
years, you'll see it's more balanced, both upside and downside. And it's a narrower corridor over time, so that
we're trying to sustain NII at a higher level for longer. That's what we're trying to engineer.
So, I think going forward, there won't be a lot of change to our philosophy in that regard. We feel like we're in a
pretty good position in terms of balance. We'll be tweaking at the margin. But what will largely drive things from
here is just normalization of deposits and good old-fashioned loan growth.

Good morning. So [ph] don't want to take issue with (00:43:27) 600 basis points of operating leverage, but I just
always like doing a little gut check. Expenses up 5%, I heard all the reasons why. A lot of investments, the FDIC
charges coming. But I just want to make sure, did anything change over the last, like, decade or so, you've been

basically flat for life. Is expenses more of a relative gain relative to revenues, or do you think you can keep
expenses in and around the same area as you continue to invest? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, Glenn, I think Alastair gave you a trajectory, which, if you look at it from fourth quarter last year to fourth
quarter this year, it gets you relatively flat year-over-year. And as revenues flatten out because the interest rate
movements flatten out, you'll see that as we decline in the quarters, that will be strong.
So as we think about it – as we think about the forward, we think about the ability to control head count and have
expenses continue to come down. But they're going to stay at a level that's relatively consistent where we are
now over time, and the goal is then to grow revenue faster than expenses.
We've been doing it for many decades. You can see that in our data. But the way we do it differs from five years
ago to 10 years ago to last year, in that the ability to move the branch configuration around when we had 6,000
branches down to 4,000 or 3,900, 3,800, now it's different from 3,800 to where it might end up. And so, you
should expect us to continue to engineer by applying massive amounts of technology.
Erica saves a lot of transactional activity. Zelle saves a lot of transactional activity. Deposits by mobile phone save
a lot of activity, all that goes on. And then what we're offsetting with that is, from the decade that you talk about,
we probably went from $2.5 billion of technology initiatives a year to $3.8 billion. And we went – we have a lot
more revenues compensated for, thinking about in the Wealth Management business, and that's – those are
things we fight all the time. So, we expect to manage expenses in line with revenue.
As we got to 2019, we told you that we're going to have to start growing expenses at a modest growth rate
relative to the revenue growth rate. We'd outgrow the economy on revenue, expense, and grow a couple hundred
basis points [ph] lower (00:45:48). We're kind of going to be back in that mode, frankly. It's just, with inflation, they
kicked up and now [ph] we're flat and back out (00:45:53) and then we'll get back in sync as we move to 2024 and
beyond.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And Glenn, look, the only thing I would just add to what Brian just said, we put up $16.2 billion in the first quarter.
We were 16-ish this quarter obviously. We kind of feel like next quarter, just with all the work that we've done
around head count and getting firm in the place we want now, we feel like we're well-positioned to deliver $15.8
billion this quarter. And when we keep going, we think we're going to be somewhere around $15.6 billion or so in
Q4.
So, to Brian's point, number one, we like the trajectory now. We've shaped the head count over time to get to the
place where we want to be. And that would compare – I think Q4 of last year was $15.5 billion. So, when you talk
about that sort of flattish idea in an inflationary environment, we feel like that's a pretty good way to end this year
and a pretty good way to set up for next year.

Glenn Schorr Q

Totally agree. Thanks for all that. Appreciate it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. So, I don't think consensus [ph] has viewed the positive outcome of the (00:47:09) third and
fourth quarter. And I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Brian, in your opening remark, is you expect
that eighth quarter of consecutive positive operating leverage to continue. So you expect nine quarters or 10
quarters or as long as you can? And on the – the one reason is just the NII headwind, you said it should be kind
of flattish in the third quarter and then down from the fourth quarter, and you said the commercial loan demand is
a little bit less and utilization is less.
On the other hand, you did just give some specific expense numbers. And maybe, I guess, so the specific
question is, how long do you expect [indiscernible] (00:47:50)? Are we done with that? Do you expect that to go?
And then to what degree do your digital efforts, your first three slides, slides 4, 5, and 6, play a part in sustaining
this positive operating leverage, say, through 2024 and 2025? Is that a goal, or is that an expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Right. Our goal is always to maintain it. And Mike, you point out that the toughest time is when you have a twist in
the interest rate environment, and you could see that at the end of 2019. And then we get – got right back into
right after the environment stabilized. But I was thinking about the question you asked me a few years ago, Mike,
was when NII is coming in, are you going to let it fall to the bottom line or are you going to spend it? And about
80-plus percent of it is falling to the bottom line, which shows you how we positioned the franchise from the
second quarter of 2021 until now as we went through the interest rate – the fast interest rate raising.
So we gave you the specific – as you said, the specific expense guides by quarter. We'd expect that to produce
operating leverage. It will be – it gets tougher, and then it will get easier as we start to see the stabilization of
deposits and loans and loan growth. You'll sort of routinely come through in the economy frankly shaking through
whether we're going to have a recession or not. And so we feel good about what we've done.
That's why I tried to give that longer period of time so people have the context. It's very different environments
how we've achieved it. Sometimes revenue fell and expense fell faster. Sometimes revenue grew and expense
grew but slower, and all the different ways. So we'll keep working at it.
And the key leading indicator we like is we've been able to manage the head count down, as Alastair said earlier,
and frankly that is in the face of a turnover rate year-over-year, which has dropped in half, which is good, because
then we're not training and hiring as many people. And that then sets us up for the second half of the year,
because that head count benefit has not really come through the P&L and will offset some of the other inflation.

And then as it relates to NII specifically, you said that the last few months you're a little bit more confident given
stabilization in pricing. I guess we're not seeing that at every bank, right? Some banks are getting worse. Some
banks are getting better. So what is it that gives you confidence on the NII front and the deposit stabilization front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, look, I can't speak to the other banks, Mike. But obviously, we know we're in a privileged and advantaged
position relative to our client base. I just think it's interesting. You look at that Global Banking set of results over
the course of the past year-and-a-half in particular, that's extraordinary resilience.
And, look, Q2 is tax season. So look at the Wealth Management business, for example, deposits were down $9
billion, but we know they paid tax payments of $14 billion, $15 billion, $16 billion last quarter. So there's beginning
to be a little more stability. And obviously, our focus has always been on transactional primary operating, and
we're maybe seeing the benefit of that in some degree.
But we showed you on slide, I think it was page 12 of the earnings deck, that's where it is. And we showed that
last quarter. We'll show it again next quarter. But it's just the Fed's engineering this across the board, and we're
just reacting to what we see from our customer base.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on deposit behavior. I appreciate the comment that you have very low
loan-to-deposit ratio, you don't have to chase rate. So it feels like betas can stay low. But how do you think about
– how are you thinking about the mix going forward? We are seeing NIBs come down, CD demand is picking up.
So how are you thinking or what are you seeing in your deposit base with respect to mix?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, Jim, one of the things that, as we think about deposits, we think about across each of the customer bases,
and that's what page 12 shows you. We think about what do they have cash flows for. They have cash to transact
and they have cash in excess of that. And what happens is, depending on the Customer segment, that cash
moves to the market, that excess cash moves to the market, but the transactional cash is all with us. That
transactional cash far exceeds for us, our loan balances.
So we have excess transactional cash. And a lot of it is low interest checking, no interest checking. Even if it's
money markets, it's that sort of cushion that consumers and wealthy people, wealthy consumers and average
consumers maintain to pay their bills and unexpected expenses. So that's what you've seen. And that produces a
cost to deposits of 1.24%, which is far different than what we see other people have. And that you can – that just
happens.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Now the question is how much moves. And as Alastair said earlier, we're after-tax time now where we have a big
Wealth Management payout to the – to taxes. We also are past the point where people have – way past the point
[indiscernible] (00:53:04) payments where people have to – that money has been in accounts and still is in their
accounts to a large degree as we look at them. And they're paying that down slowly. So the average balance in
our checking accounts has gone from a high of $11,000 at the peak to $10,600, $10,500 or something like that.
So, all that dynamic that you've got to go back and say, it's – the mix of interest bearing and non-interest bearing
is actually a little bit of a misnomer, because it's really what the customer uses the cash for. And if they use it to
transact and run their household, that's a very stable base. And that's what the status shows across time. And it's
fundamentally a lot higher than pre-pandemic.
So Consumer, $700 billion pre-pandemic, $1 trillion now. Checking of that, if you look on the pages in deposit
descriptions, you'll see those numbers are – page 13, I think it is – those numbers will show you how much has
stayed in checking. That's because we have more customers, but more importantly, the average consumer
through inflation and stuff has more money around. And that provides great grist for the mill.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. So do you feel like that mix shift is starting to slow and stabilize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, that's what the data on page 12 shows you. That's why we show you this level of detail in our customer
basis and our lines of business that many don't show you to demonstrate that, that difference is there for us. And
other people may be there, too. I just can't find it in their data. But if you look, that's why we show you page 12, so
you actually see during the second quarter the week-by-week average balance movement.
And as Alastair said earlier, it's very stable in GWIM. It's very stable in Global Banking, even in non-interest
bearing piece. Half of that is excess balance, half of it is earnings credit rates through the GTS process. And so
you've got to be careful of that. And then you look at the Consumer, and it's bouncing around the high-$980 billion
to $1 trillion depending on the thing and ended at $1 trillion. And that happens when payroll happens and all that
stuff. But that's hugely advantaged pricing, 20-odd basis points in total for the Consumer business.
And you asked about CDs. We only have $40 billion of CDs. So we are – our customers are asking for CD rates.
We give them, too, it's just not the core business. And then we have the investment side. We push those – Wealth
Management flows, and the Consumer investment flows are part of our deposits moving over to the market when
there's excess cash.

Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. In the press release, the last week's settlement with
BofA, CFPB Director Chopra alleged that you, among other things, opened customer accounts without consent.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Couple of questions. One on operating leverage that I know you discussed earlier. I mean, in the past, when you
had the record number of consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, it seemed like it was being driven
[ph] primarily by a lot (00:58:03) of inputs, but one of the big drivers was consolidation of branches. And now it's
an investment spend environment in branches. So I'm just wondering if there is a core platform to the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Betsy, that's kind of what I said earlier. It's been gotten by different ways in different periods of time. But even in
the last year, the numbers of branches, I think, dropped about from 3,900 to 3,800 and change and so even as we
deployed new ones. So you're consolidating branches in markets you've been in a long time with lots of branches.
The ATM count continues to drift down.
But importantly, if you go to the digital pages and look at the activity levels by customers, and you're speaking
mostly the Consumer business, but it affects all customer bases. And you see things like Zelle transactions far
exceeding checks. Remember that what that means is we don't have to process a check on the back end of that
and so – and then – and process it, push it through. So all that continues to grow very quickly and continues to
change the overall operating cost in our Consumer business. Our cost of operating plus the cost of pays and
deposit is still 130-odd basis points or whatever, it's very strong.
If we go – where the big moves are coming is what we're doing in the markets business, for example, in terms of
deeper, deeper digitization, it was always – equity trading was always digitized, but the operational process
behind that, the throughput of – the amount of stuff that's going straight through. And then what's behind that also,
in the Wealth Management, customers getting their statements and statements not being delivered to customers'
home but being delivered electronically is a $0.5 billion annual benefit that's accumulated over time.
And so if there was some magic thing you could pull, you'd pull it, but these are a whole bunch of operational
excellence ideas. It seems inchmeal to the general public, but it just, as this constant improvement to the platform,
allows us to constantly manage people down, as the percentage of the work done by people always comes down.
And then now with artificial intelligence and all the enthusiasm, leave aside that's in the future, the way we've
applied it so far has enabled us to do things like our business bankers are more efficient at calling, because we
use artificial intelligence and programs to tell them which prospects to go to, not to tell – they know their clients
and they run it, but which prospects they should approach first, so they're more efficient. Or the Advisor Match,
which has an intelligence base built into it to match the client to an advisor that's – you saw the statistics about the
numbers of leads, 20,000 leads. All this is adding efficiency.

So, yes, the branch system has got – if it come – it's come down a slope, and that slope is starting to flatten out.
But in that slope is a massive reinvestment in rehabs and a massive opening, and then more and more deposits
over top of that, which keeps that efficiency going.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So your point on enthusiasm for AI, but in your comments, it sounds like there's more legs to that that you're
anticipating going forward as well. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Erica, we started working on probably eight years ago now to a natural language processing capability that
can answer questions that we can make sure the answer was what we want it to be, and that ran on our
proprietary systems. And so it's an algorithm that anticipates the answer to the question, but it comes from our
data and then looks in your account. But there was 165 million interactions in the last quarter. All of them would
have been an email, a text, a phone call. And they were all done through the customer entering it into Erica and
getting an answer and then going on. And started – but that will just keep expanding to become a higher and
higher functionality.
It is a start at a methodology, which these new programs are far in excess of that, but they're not tested on data.
They hallucinate in all these wonderful things you hear the experts talk about, that have to be carefully controlled
before you apply it. But Erica is using some of the principles and apply it in a very controlled environment.
And by the way, when we do it with our drafting a credit offering memorandum, or we do it with a business
targeting that we talked about, all those are ways that we apply it. But it's in a very controlled setting. So it still has
a lot more out there, frankly, as it gets understood better and how it works better and how it can be add to
attribution accountability, those types of things have to be built in. But Erica, that was built on from the start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the capital question. I know that you are reviewing the SCB with the
Fed. But I'm just trying to understand what kind of expectations you have for buybacks as we look forward here,
realizing that there's some puts and takes with Basel III, but there's some benefits with the SCB? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So we've got the final stress capital buffer along with the rest of the industry in August. So we'll wait for
that, obviously. And then, Betsy, I think we'll likely have to wait for Basel III final clarity. That's still moving. We
don't have the proposed rule yet. Then, we have to wait for the comment period. Then, we've got to wait for the
final rule. So, there's a lot that needs to run before we get full perspective.
And I think Brian said it well, I think we've got plenty of capital. We've been buying back enough shares to offset
the share dilution, and we've got flexibility to do a little bit more. So the other thing you see over the course of the
past year is, obviously, stress capital buffer last year, and we had to add 90 basis points. Well, we've added 110
basis points over the course of the past year and kept return on tangible common equity around 15.5%, while
buying back shares. So we've got the flexibility to do a little bit of everything. But I think we want to see what the
final rules look like before we make too many decisions.

Operator: We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just one question on credit to follow up your comments. So, it looks like the card normalization
is progressing very gradually, 90 days past dues up, but only kind of marginally. Just your points about the
consumer having still plenty of cash, the economy holding up well, just your view on just ongoing normalization of
card losses specifically, and just anything else that we should be mindful of when we think about credit
normalization. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Ken, I think you nailed it. That sort of being – you just – you watch our – if you look at our charge-offs, for
example, that's mainly about loan growth and a little bit about the rate picking up just a little bit. But it's still well
below pandemic. You can see that. And fourth quarter 2019 was a great quarter for asset quality in card.
So, it gets back to this idea that the consumer still is in a pretty healthy place. You can see that in the
unemployment statistics, and you can see it in the way that they're just continuing to spend a little bit more money
year-over-year. So, I feel like we've been pretty consistent. The consumer is pretty resilient. That remains the
case, and we're benefiting from it right now in the card experience.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And – thanks, and sorry, just one more follow-up. On the fee side, can you help us understand the card deposit
service charges, asset management kind of all been stable to slightly lower. Have the effects that you put through
in terms of all the service charges changes and new rewards type of card benefits and all that, are we close to
getting that run rated? Any signals of stability in some of those areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, as Alastair mentioned earlier, there's been a 10-year change in how we worked in the overdraft area in the
biggest – and another set of change were made and fully implemented in the third quarter of last year. So, they're
in the current run rate. It's just a year-over-year comparison. This quarter picks up a little bit of pre-final changes
to post.
So if you look at the FDIC data, I think we're down to 30-odd-million dollars a quarter, something like that, and
overdraft fees compared to others, there are multiples of that. But we've – it's all through the system. It's all done,

and all the changes required of under the recent announcements and stuff have been made for a couple years.
So it's in the run rate, so to speak.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Charles Peabody with Portales. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners LLC (Connecticut)
Good morning. A question about your interest-bearing deposits with the Fed. And I'm looking at page 8, your
average balance sheet, and those balances were up quite considerably quarter-over-quarter, and yet your deposit
base was relatively flat. So I was just curious what the thinking behind that was. Was it a desire to build liquidity?
Was there arbitrage opportunity for NII? What was – why build the balances so aggressively?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So if you go back to – we talked about this at the end of last quarter, Charles. At the end of last quarter, it
was an interesting time for the industry, and we felt like it was prudent to just build cash during a period like that.
And so that's what we did. And it was obviously an extraordinary period. Since then, as the environment is
normalizing, I'd anticipate, and I talked about that earlier, you'll see our cash levels just continue to come back
down. And so that's all that's happening. It was a choice on our part to position with cash, and you'll begin to see
that drift lower now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles W. Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners LLC (Connecticut)
Okay. As a follow-up then, would that imply that the average balance sheet, or more importantly, RWAs will start
to shrink and that would help your capital? I'm just trying to understand the capital...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
No, it shouldn't really impact RWAs, because most of that is sort of low or zero RWA. What it should impact is, if
you look at our net interest yield, that's always a question of numerator and denominator. And when we increased
the cash balances, that inflates the denominator for a period of time. So, that doesn't hurt NII, but it does inflate
your balance sheet just a little bit.
So I think, as you look forward, what you should expect is we just get back to work on both parts of the numerator
and denominator. We'll grind away at the NII side. And then on the denominator side, we'll have a smaller, more
efficient balance sheet as the environment normalizes. And in the meantime, it hasn't hurt NII in any way.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2023
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I am sorry I missed the earlier call. On the net interest income trajectory, Alastair, clearly a big
focus for your shareholders, you mentioned, when you were responding to Gerard's first question, that you
narrowed the volatility of net interest income. And I think that investors, I'm sure, are going to start asking you
guys and us about the starting point of $14 billion for NII next year.
I guess, we're wondering, if the Fed stays higher for longer and doesn't move, how does that impact that $14
billion run rate? Does that $14 billion capture a cumulative deposit beta that would sort of fully reflect what you
would expect to experience through the cycle? And then I have a follow-up question from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So all of our asset disclosures reflect the betas that we believe at the time. So, that part is always in the
disclosures. It's too early for me to say on 2024. We're giving guidance for the rest of the year, so you have a
pretty good sense of what we're pretty confident around. But last time I looked at the forward curve, we had one,
possibly two hikes this year, and then as many as five declines next year. So, there's a lot between here and
there, and I think we'll just as soon take the next three to six months to figure out, Erika, exactly how we feel about
2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Totally understand. So, going back to the down 100 basis point disclosure, that would yield to down $3 billion for a
full year basis. How much of that – given that you have exposure to the shape of the curve, not just the short end
of the curve because of your securities book, how much of that is short rates versus long rates in terms of that
drop?
I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, if I simply divide $3 billion by four, right, that would get me a run rate of
$13.25 billion on a quarterly basis. And you mentioned that there are about five cuts in next year. But if it's not all
the short end, right, and if it's half-half, then I could get to a run rate of $13.75 billion. So just – I know there's a lot
in there, so I'd just love your thoughts on everything I just said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, you lost me a little, but I'll say this. We've got – it's actually down $3.6 billion. It's not down $3 billion. So
that's number one. Number two, you should think about the short end being the vast majority of that. And number
three, part of the reason that I think we feel like we've narrowed this corridor and we've got a little more stability
around it is, A, the securities book; and B, just as importantly, there's been a large rotation into interest-bearing.
And so, as rates – in a disclosure like this, as rates come down, one would expect that we'll be somewhat
insulated from that in a different way than we might have two years ago when we didn't have as much interest-
bearing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Thank you.

Operator: We'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. I just keep staring at slides 4, 5, and 6 for the digital progress that you're making and trying to connect that to
your expenses and operating leverage. And I guess, where I get to is, certainly, you're signaling that trends
should be good for revenue versus expense or, at least, you're trying to have that. But I still look at the efficiency
ratio expenses for revenues of 64% or 62% and then you compare that to the levels from 2018 and 2019 when it
was 57% and 58%.
So I guess the question is, do you guys – with all these digital initiatives and progress, and again, I appreciate the
disclosure on these slides, and it would be great to have more of your peers disclose that all that progress, why
can't you get back to levels from 2018 or 2019 or, at least, below 60%? And if so, how long would it take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Mike, the linkage of the digital activity to produce the many quarters of operating leverage at last 8.5 years, et
cetera, is an absolutely [ph] buy. (01:13:54) And Betsy asked about the branch count and all the things we've
done. The efficiency ratio for us is – has a plain element, which is the Wealth Management business is a big part
of our revenue base and has a different operating dynamic because of how it's reported.
As you well know, the revenue has the cost of compensation, the percent of revenue is high, and we basically
make $0.50 on $1 for every $1 past the revenue takeout, which – the advisor compensation level. And we'll
continue try to improve that and make the advisor more efficient and things like that. But that's a major change.
We improved year-over-year, and frankly, we're still cleaning out some pandemic-related costs and things like
that.
So we'll continue to drive that down. And as net interest income has come up and a more important part of the
business, that helps push that efficiency ratio back down. And that's the goal. I mean, you're describing what we
go to work and do every day, and the way we do it is the application of technology across the board and then
removing work from the system and bringing that out and bringing it to the bottom line and then making the
investments we did to make it happen again. So we'll continue to do that. But the efficiency ratio, remember, for
us, if you go line of business is best-in-class. It's just we have a bigger mix towards the Wealth Management
business than most other people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And let me try one more time. On Erica and, I guess, it could be Bank of America AI, maybe [ph] if you're
(01:15:22) keeping out your Erica business. But you guys highlight a number of hours it saves in manual labor.
And do you have a connection of that to what that saves in expenses or what that could save or should save over
the next few years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. It will continue to allow us to do more with the same amount. So if you think about 2019 to now, Mike,
remember the number of customers who do their core checking [ph] list is (01:15:52) up 10%, so it's not a – and

that is a lot of people. It's 3 million more customers doing 20, 30 transactions a month. And all that's going
through on a relatively flat expense base. And we've been – we've had – with inflation and wages and things,
we've absorbed all that as part of the thing. And that's why the costs have changed. But the reality is we flatten
that back out, and then we'll keep driving it back down.
And that if you look at the cost to deposits, which is the cost of running all that as a percentage of deposits, you
can see that on the Consumer page, it still maintains a nice break against the rate that we receive for the deposit
balances. So we're working on it. Simply put, we had 100,000 people in the Consumer business a decade-plus
ago, we now have [ph] 16 (01:16:37) going, and it comes down a little bit every quarter, even though we're putting
new branches with an average of 5 to 10 people in depending on the location and things like that going on. And
so that just keeps going in the right direction.
Now if you take that across other things, in our operations group, the team there continues to have flat head count
to down head count, and we invest that back in the technology side for more developers, 20,000-odd on our
payroll plus another 10,000, 15,000 are third party that go through frankly the top line. And so we keep trying to
drive it in to make us more efficient. So all the principles you're saying are right, and we expect it to continue to
have a benefit.

Thank you and – for joining us, all. As you think about the quarter, strong profitability, strong 15% return on
tangible common equity or better, continue to drive organic growth, continue to drive operating leverage, and we
gave you clarity on the future path of expenses in NII. But above all else in the quarter where we've had a strong
capital markets performance and a strong investment banking performance, I think along with our other usual
great performances business, and we feel good about the company as we position going forward. Thank you.
