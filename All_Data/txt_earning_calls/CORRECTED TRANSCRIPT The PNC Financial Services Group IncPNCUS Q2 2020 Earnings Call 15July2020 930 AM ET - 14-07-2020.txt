William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, our results for the second quarter
had a number of moving parts, including obviously the gain on the sale of our stake in BlackRock. Overall, I
thought it was a pretty solid quarter in the context of the environment that we're operating in. You would have
seen that revenue was down from the first quarter, which if you remember included some kind of one-off gains,
and expenses were well-managed. We were able to produce positive operating leverage both in Q2 and for the
first half of the year.
However, as we mentioned in our first quarter call, our view of the economy has substantially worsened since we
closed the books three months ago and in turn has resulted in a substantial loan loss reserve build. Our recent
CCAR results should lay to rest any concern that this is a PNC-specific balance sheet problem. The CCAR results
underscore the strength of our balance sheet, which coupled with the benefits of the monetization of our
BlackRock investment, positioned PNC with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our
constituents and capitalize on opportunities that can arise during disrupted markets.
In fact, our capital ratios are at record levels and we saw a significant increase in our book value. Looking ahead,
I fully recognize that we are perhaps a bit more pessimistic than the market on the odds of a full recovery anytime
soon. While recent economic data has been encouraging, we're still in the very early innings of how this is going
to play out. Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus has allowed us to in fact kick the can down the road in terms of
feeling the real effects of this recession. Much is going to depend on continuing support from the government as
the economy continues to adjust with life with COVID.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Unfortunately, what is becoming very clear at least to me is that there is a new normal that will have profound and
lasting effects on parts of our economy and the workforce that supports it. Despite these challenging times in
which you're navigating simultaneous crises, both the pandemic and civil unrest caused by deep racial inequities,
PNC has remained steadfast in our commitment to our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.
Despite the challenges of COVID, we continue to make good progress in terms of executing on our key strategic
focus areas, including national middle market expansion and our national digital effort.
Now, before I turn it over to Rob, I want to recognize and thank our employees who are going above and beyond
to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing. I also want to thank my leadership team
including Carole Brown and Richard Bynum, the newest members of our Executive Committee, for their
invaluable support during this time. And finally, I want to thank our board of directors for their leadership as we
continue to navigate what has been a year of both extraordinary challenges and opportunities.
Now, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your
questions.

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter, we
divested our equity investment in BlackRock, which generated $14.2 billion in net proceeds with an after-tax gain
of $4.3 billion. PNC's portion of BlackRock results, both second quarter activity and prior periods, are now
reported on a – or as discontinued operations.
Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. On the asset side, total loans grew $24.5
billion to $268 billion linked quarter. Investment securities of $88 billion increased $4 billion or 5%. Our cash
balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $34 billion and were $50 billion at the end of the quarter. The
significant increase was the result of liquidity from the sale of our investment in BlackRock and strong deposit
growth.
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $335 billion for the quarter and were up $45 billion or 16% linked
quarter. Total borrowed funds decreased $4 billion compared to the first quarter. Importantly, on a spot basis,
borrowed funds declined approximately $26 billion, as we used excess liquidity to reduce borrowings primarily
with the Federal Home Loan Bank. And our tangible book value was $93.54 per common share as of June 30, an
increase of 10% linked quarter and 16% year-over-year.
As you can see on slide 5, our capital reserve and liquidity positions are all strong. As of June 30, 2020, our Basel
III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 11.3%. Our board recently approved a quarterly dividend of
$1.15 per share, which is consistent with the previous quarter. As you know, the Fed has authorized dividends for
the third quarter, subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the proceeding four quarters.
On this basis, our third quarter dividend is 27% of our average net income for the prior four quarters.
In regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the Federal Reserve's guidance, we'll continue to suspend
share repurchases through the third quarter with the exception of permissible employee benefit-related
purchases. Our loan loss reserve levels have increased substantially in light of the current economic conditions
and are now at 2.55%. We remain core funded with a low cost deposit base, and importantly, our liquidity
coverage ratios significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements.

Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $268 billion in the second
quarter were up $25 billion or 10% compared to the first quarter. This growth reflected an increase in commercial
loan balances of approximately $25 billion, driven by higher utilization related to line draws, short-term liquidity
facilities to support our clients and new loan balances under the Paycheck Protection Program.
Consumer loans declined approximately $700 million, reflecting lower activity in card, auto and student loans. It's
worth noting that spot loans declined $6.4 billion, predominantly related to lower commercial loan utilization. Our
C&IB segment experienced a 5.5% decline in utilization rates from peak levels, as approximately 75% of the lines
that were drawn were subsequently paid down. At quarter-end, utilization rates were approximately 1% above
pre-COVID rates.
Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans grew 14% or $33 billion. As the slide shows, the yield on
our loan balances declined 71 basis points to 3.37% in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the
Fed's 150 basis point reduction in interest rates during the first quarter, which drove LIBOR rates lower as well.
The rate paid on our deposits also declined 47 basis points linked quarter to 23 basis points.
Average deposit balances of $335 billion increased $45 billion or 16% linked quarter. Commercial deposits grew,
reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers due to COVID-19 concerns. Consumer deposits also
grew primarily due to government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending. Year-over-year, deposits
increased $62 billion or 23%.
As you can see on slide 7, second quarter total revenue was $4.1 billion, down $260 million linked quarter or 6%.
Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $16 million or 1% compared to the first quarter, as higher earning asset
balances and lower funding costs offset lower yields. Our net interest margin decreased to 2.52%, down 32 basis
points linked quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the 150 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
during March 2020 and the related decline in other market rates.
Noninterest income of $1.6 billion declined $276 million or 15% linked quarter. Fee revenue decreased $204
million or 14%. Consumer services and service charges on deposits declined by $136 million in total, due to lower
consumer activity and fee waivers in the second quarter. Residential mortgage production volumes and loan sales
revenues were both higher, but were more than offset by a lower RMSR valuation, and asset management and
corporate services remained relatively stable.
Other noninterest income declined $72 million, reflecting lower securities gains, partially offset by strong client
activity in corporate securities and capital markets. Noninterest expense declined $28 million or 1% compared to
the first quarter, due to lower business activity, as well as continued progress on our cost savings initiatives
related to our Continuous Improvement Program.
As Bill mentioned, we generated positive operating leverage for the second quarter, both year-over-year and
year-to-date. Provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion, reflecting a worsening in our economic outlook relative to
March, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. And our effective tax rate was 17.5%.
Slide 8 is an update to the template we introduced in the first quarter regarding specific industries we've identified
as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances as of June 30 to
these industries are $19.6 billion and represent approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio. We haven't yet
experienced any material charge-offs in these industries. However, if current economic trends continue, we'll see
charge-offs increase over time.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Corporate loan balances in these industries totaled $11.5 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million since
March 31 resulting from funding of $2 billion of PPP loans. Excluding the PPP loans, balances are down
approximately 10%. Nonperforming loans in these industries were flat linked quarter at just under 1% of loan
outstanding, but criticized assets did grow during the quarter with the greatest stress seen in leisure, recreation
and travel.
We have $8.1 billion in loans to high impact industries in our commercial real estate portfolio, a decrease of
approximately $600 million since the end of March. Nonperforming loans in the real estate categories increased
from approximately $5 million at March 31 to just over $140 million, driven almost entirely by a single mall REIT
related credit. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see substantial stress in the retail and lodging segments.
Turning to slide 9, this is an update on our oil and gas portfolio, which at the end of the second quarter was $4.1
billion or less than 2% of total outstanding loans. Outstanding loan balances have declined approximately $500
million since March 31, 2020. As expected, we continue to see an increase in the nonperforming loans, which
now represent approximately 4% of current outstandings in this portfolio. We believe we're properly reserved for
this portfolio and we'll continue to monitor market conditions.
Turning to slide 10, we're continuing to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through loan modifications
during these uncertain times. With our consumer customers, we're granting loan modifications through
extensions, deferrals and forbearance. New requests for modifications have declined 97% from their peak in early
April. But year-to-date, we've granted assistance to nearly 280,000 customer accounts, representing $12.7 billion
of loans, $6.6 billion of which is investor-owned and $6.1 billion which is bank-owned.
Of the $6.1 billion bank-owned modifications, they continue to represent a small percentage of both overall
accounts and total loan exposures for each asset class, and a significant percentage of clients have made at least
one payment in the last 60 days. Although these payments suggest a potential decrease in modifications as
extension periods begin to expire, we believe it's too early to make that conclusion. On the commercial side, we're
offering emergency relief for small and medium-sized businesses, including through the PPP loans. We're also
selectively granting loan modifications to commercial clients based on each individual borrower's situation.
Our credit quality metrics are presented on slide 11. Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $236 million, a $24
million increase from the first quarter. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans remain stable at 35 basis points.
Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion at June 30 declined $173 million or 12%, reflecting a decline in delinquencies
related to the CARES Act, as well as other forbearance and extension [ph] fees (00:14:34).
Nonperforming loans increased $232 million or 14% compared to March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by commercial real estate borrowers and the high impact COVID-19 industries, as well as borrowers in the
energy industry, which I previously mentioned. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans has
increased to 2.55% in the second quarter compared to 1.66% last quarter, primarily resulting from our updated
economic forecasts, which incorporated significant COVID-19 impact on the economy.
Importantly, we believe the economic assumptions used in the scenarios to generate our CECL reserve estimates
this quarter sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in our current portfolio. Therefore, we don't anticipate any
substantial reserve builds during the remainder of 2020 based on these assumptions, which I will cover next. The
recent CCAR results highlight the quality of PNC's loan portfolio. Under the severely adverse scenario, our
cumulative losses as a percentage of our total portfolio were lower than most of our peers. However, based on
our economic outlook under the CECL methodology, we did have a substantial increase in our allowance this
quarter.

Slide 12 highlights the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses. Our attribution shows the
increase in reserves of $557 million for portfolio changes and approximately $1.6 billion for economic factors. Our
weighted average economic scenario is derived from four separate scenarios and uses a number of economic
variables, with the largest drivers being GDP and the unemployment rate. In this scenario, annualized GDP
contracts 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, finishing the year down 4.9% from the fourth quarter 2019 levels and
recovering to pre-recession peak levels by the first quarter of 2022.
Additionally, this scenario assumes the quarterly unemployment rate falls to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of this year
from a peak at 13.6% in the second quarter, with the labor market continuing to recover in 2021 and 2022. For
internal analytical purposes, we also considered hypothetically what our capital ratios would be if we had a year-
end 2020 allowance for credit losses equal to the nine-quarter Fed CCAR severely adverse scenario losses of
$12.1 billion, essentially front-loading an incremental $5.5 billion in reserves over the next few quarters. I want to
emphasize the scenario is not our expectation, but simply approximate the possible outcome under a hypothetical
severe condition.
The analysis resulted in a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% at December 31, 2020, a level well above 7%, which
is our regulatory minimum of 4.5% plus our stress capital buffer of 2.5%. In summary, from a capital, liquidity and
loan loss reserve perspective, we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment.
Clearly, the biggest variables impacting the economy continue to be the duration of this crisis and the efficacy of
the massive US Government support and stimulus programs. At this time, we have no way of knowing these
outcomes and visibility remains low.
Within that context, our guidance for the third quarter and our thoughts for the full-year are as follows. For the
third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020, we expect average loans to decline in the low
single-digit range. We expect net interest income to be down approximately 1%. We expect total noninterest
income to be down between 3% and 5%, which includes our expectation that core fee revenue will be stable,
while other noninterest income will be lower in the quarter.
We expect total noninterest expense to be flat to down. And in regard to net charge-offs, we expect third quarter
levels to be between $250 million and $350 million. For the full-year – and again, I want to emphasize the context
and limitation of low visibility – we now expect both revenue and noninterest expense to each be down between
2% and 5% and our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the low-teens.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, John. It's Rob. Good morning. We don't provide NIM guidance, so to speak, because it's an outcome.
But I would say, generally speaking, I expect margins to remain sort of stable. We'll clearly see some lower yields
as a function of rates being lower. But we also have some more room on the liability side. So, I think largely they'll
offset.

Right, okay. All right, that's helpful. And then separately, Bill, I just want to see if you can give us an update on
your thoughts around the potential deployment of the BlackRock capital, if your thought process has changed at
all since you completed the sale of the stake and if you could just give us just how you're thinking about ultimately
putting that to work. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No real changes. We're going to be patient here. I think like I said in my script, we're in pretty early innings
here to see how this all plays out. The fiscal payments that the government's put out, plus what the Fed's done is
effectively masked what are some pretty severe underlying problems in the economy. And depending on how fast
that comes back and/or if the government keeps providing stimulus, it'll tell us how much of that capital we need in
the first place, and secondly, what the opportunities will be to deploy it. So, we're going to be patient. The strategy
of trying to pursue bank-like acquisitions to help us expand our national franchise remains the same.

Hey. Rob, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the nuance within the fee income guide for the third
quarter. It sounds like the...

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
The core fees that you guide to are pretty stable, but maybe just sort of the puts and takes and then some – how I
guess – maybe a retrospective I guess on how some of those activity-based fees came in relative to what you
guys would have thought and how they trended through the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think I'll answer it sort of backwards there. I think in retrospect, I think it largely came in as we expected,
softer on the consumer side, which we did expect as a function of the lower activity as well as fee waivers.
Corporate services was actually pretty strong, down a little bit, but some good activity there that might have been
a little better than what we expected. And then asset management and mortgage, both came in with expectations,
asset management relatively flat, mortgage up a bit in terms of production. We had that – lapped that large RMSR
gain in the first quarter. So, we were down quarter-over-quarter, but production levels were up. So, I'd in
retrospect, they came in as we expected. Going forward, in terms of stable for the third quarter – and again, you
know, Scott, it's fluid. So, visibility is low.

And then, to switch gears, [ph] Bill (00:23:42), on the reserve – this may end up being totally premature given how
fluid this situation is. But if you guys are right in your assumptions and there's no need for additional reserve build,
how does provisioning then traject, like at what point or how much clarity does one need in a CECL world before
like you start drawing down the reserve? How does that kind of stuff work in this newer reserving world?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

scenarios improve, provided that you didn't need the reserves for charge-offs, you'd start to release. That's just
CECL definition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Yeah. Yeah, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] I mean (00:24:41) mechanically, if all else holds true on assumptions, that you roll down and burn off the
reserve with your charge-offs and you add life of the loan reserves for whatever new loans come on...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right, right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And in effect, you'd be adding provision for new loans and everything else would solve to zero, if everything else
held equal, which it most certainly won't.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

incorporate the levels of loans and then the economic assumptions.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay, perfect. And if I can sneak just one final one and just so I'm certain I'm on the right page, the
BlackRock gain, just for the purposes of the dividend – or excuse me, the earnings deficiency test that's now part
of the CCAR rules, there is nothing that like disqualifies that gain, right, like it counts in your trailing 12 month...

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. My first question is for you, Bill. So, one of your peers, Jamie Dimon, said something yesterday
that really struck me, in that he said, don't count out buybacks for the fourth quarter. And given that we don't have
any of the information in terms of capital plans beyond the third quarter and given that you have a significant
amount of capital even if the severely adverse scenario becomes your base case, I am wondering what your view
is in terms of balancing buyback activity near-term, when it's more allowable to do so, versus just keeping the
powder dry for that opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
First of all, if we get into an environment where somehow buybacks are allowed in the fourth quarter, I'm not sure
where he was going with that in terms of – maybe he's hearing something from the Fed I'm not. But ignoring that,
just assume that there were no restrictions at the moment for the Fed, I continue to believe that we are going to
see opportunities both organic and inorganic in this environment to deploy that capital in a very shareholder-
friendly way. At the margin, would we use some of our capital to support our share price? Of course, we would.
But that would be value-dependent and it would be also dependent on the environment that we're operating in
and whether or not we saw confirmation of our belief that there'll be opportunities or not. So, it's – we'll see.
You've heard me use the phrase over and over again that we'll be rational stewards of your capital.

Robert Q. Reilly A

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And as a follow-up, the one thing that also struck me in the quarter is the amount of cash on your balance
sheet. Aside from the BlackRock proceeds, obviously, the deposit growth has been significant. And Rob, I'm
wondering as you think about your revenue guide for the rest of the year, what do you assume in terms of the
deployment of that cash?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Erika. So, we will put some of that to work tactically. We won't put all of it to work obviously, and given
particularly in terms of securities yields, it's pretty hard to make up a lot of revenue deploying that. So, we're going
to run with some pretty high cash balances through the balance of the year. But as far as securities deployment,
loan – loan balances, that's all factored into our guidance.

Erika Najarian Q

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. A big picture question for you, Bill, just ex the BlackRock sale, the business returns
to more of a traditional regional banking look in your wheelhouse. And I'm just wondering, as you think about,
whether it's ROA, ROE, potential long-term efficiency ratio, how do you now just think, if any differently just about
the structure of the company, the business mix and where you want to head from here long-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't know that we necessarily think differently about it strategically. We've had a focus and we'll continue a
focus through time on organic growth of our consumer lending balances is we simply try to penetrate existing
clients, and then to the extent we acquire clients, the same thing. Our business model is basically built on our
ability to go to new markets and profitably build share, not just through lending, but through heavy cross-sell and
to fund that through our national digital expansion. So, it's less of a focus on, do I need to somehow change the
mix of what we're doing as opposed to can we accelerate the actual growth of what we're doing in the
environment that we're in and coming into, and our belief is that we'll be able to do that. Inside of that as we look
at different opportunities, might things change at the margin? Sure. But it's not by design. It's basically to take
what we have and grow it even faster than we have historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And as a follow-up to that and then the prior questions, there's the needs versus wants when people think
about the potential inorganic strategies, when you think about the franchise and to your point earlier about moving
towards consumer has been a strategy for a bit. Are there things that you just either like to have or think you need
to have to still have like the full complement or is it more just going to be about what's opportunistically out there
and what's financial as much as it is strategic?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There is nothing on the list that we think we need to have that we don't have. We want to take our existing
products and services and go-to-market strategy and do that in more markets. This issue of something financial
versus strategic, the issue of – and we'd obviously look at both. The issue of doing a purely financial transaction is
one of, does it cause us to take our eye off the ball in terms of our long-term growth potential, it doesn't mean we
wouldn't do it, and what we would do with financial proceeds is accelerate organic growth. But ideally, we'd find
something that's both very financially attractive and matches our strategic agenda of expanding our geography.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Sticking somewhat on the theme here of what you'll do with the excess capital, I guess to frame
the question – and by the way, I agree that we're still early and lots to still play out. But how do you know if the
opportunity that you're looking for won't be there, and then kind of like what's plan B, right? Like the hope is
there'll be something interesting strategically and financially beneficial, and you'll know it when it's there. And I
think the investors and analysts trust you guys to do the right thing there. But if that doesn't arrive, when do you
kind of capitulate and say, let's go to plan B and maybe rates are higher and you can buy some securities or you
buy back stock, like what's the thought process there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
The thought process, Matt, is – this will sound a little bit wrong, but to make that decision or worry about that if in
fact we get into that environment. At the moment, we're in the middle of an environment where we – I think Mike
Corbat said this yesterday that there's more we don't know than we do. It is really unclear what the long-term
damage is going to be to the economy and how long it's going to take to grow back. And our focus right now is to
make sure we have, in Jamie's words, a fortress balance sheet, that we're serving our customers, that we're
opportunistic inside of what is a fairly strange environment at the moment, and we'll sit and watch. And if all of that
changes, then of course we'll change and re-plan and regroup and refocus and so forth. But today, none of that
has changed.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, we continue the course. And I know you guys want to sort of somehow drive us into a corner that says, if the
following three things happen, then are you going to do A, B or C. And my brain can't do that math. So, we're not
going to go down that path.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Fair enough. And then just maybe...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I would just add to that. We're fairly confident that an opportunity will arise, and if it does, we'll do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then, maybe in the meantime and from an organic perspective, it still seems like there's a couple of areas
that you could spend a little bit to try and grow. I know mortgage has been kind of a frustrating area over the
years, but there's been some dislocation in the industry from peers. That still seems like an area that you could be
bigger. Capital Markets, you have bulked up and you saw some of that strength first half this year. But obviously
at really big kind of mega banks, they're getting the benefit in trading and investment banking from this unusual
environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, just thoughts on kind of organically or from the bolt-on deals that you've done in the past focusing in those two
areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Look, I wouldn't rule anything out. Neither of those necessarily fit the longer term strategic issues we're facing. But
mortgage is an interesting question, because we've clearly seen some stress in the – I'm going to say the non-
capitalized mortgage players. And to the extent that becomes a structural change in the industry, which would in
turn cause mortgage itself to be more profitable for banks...

Right, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Then we could look to grow that. At the moment, the structural challenges with the mortgage business, as you
know, the costs to comply with various regulations coupled with the capacity in the market just make it difficult to
make money. Now, of course, we're in another refi boom and all that looks good at the moment. But long-term,
that's not necessarily true. If that changes and/or if the government agency model changes such that you have to
deploy capital to be in the mortgage business, then that could be attractive.
The capital markets business, we purposefully have been careful in picking our spots in that. That is a business
that, in my experience, returns more to employees than it necessarily does to shareholders through the cycle and
offers lower returns on capital through the cycle. But maybe with some of the changes in Volcker and the
opportunities we're clearly seeing just in the ability to in effect broker trades and the margins in that, maybe we
would expand them. But we can do that organically. We wouldn't need to at all purchase something to do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, basically, everybody is bluntly struggling. Nobody can figure out why the stock market is where it is. And
everybody at the margin – unless you're directly volume impacted for whatever reason by COVID in a positive
way, everybody is basically off. So, industrial production comes back, but it's still 11% down year-on-year. So –
and positive readings are positive readings from what was a really negative number. The struggle I'm personally
having with a lot of the data is I watch continuing claims, they published a number of 17 million plus or minus
people, but there's 32 million people getting unemployment benefits today, right, because of the CARES Act
special provision that allows sole proprietors and gig workers to get unemployment.
So, with 32 million people getting unemployment out of 150 million US workers, yet we're saying the
unemployment rate is only, whatever they're quoting today, 13%. I can't connect the dots. I see the dollars that
are coming in to our deposit balances, and you see it from unemployment claims, which are causing our retail
customers who are receiving unemployment on average to have higher balances than they had when they were
employed, which is in turn driving consumer spending and part of this economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And so, Jamie went on this rant and he's exactly right. We see consumers flush with cash. We see no
delinquencies. We see consumer spending increasing. And it's all at the moment based on government writing a
check. And I just don't know how this plays out. But the generic corporate client we talk to, who's otherwise open
and doing business, is almost without exception down from what they would have expected going into the year
and down from where they were last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, for sure.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, I did cover that, Gerard. So, compared to the peak, we're down – which was mid-April, we're down 97%
in terms of new requests. So, our expectation is, again all things remaining equal, that new requests would be
pretty minimal. But now as Bill mentioned, things are fluid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And the other thing is we're just now coming off of the period of the initial requests. And so, it's frankly too
early to really tell how many of those customers are going to ask for extension versus going back to their normal
payment plans.

If I may, on the requests for people that are in some sort of forbearance, when they come back to you, is it an
automatic approval or do you have a process in place where you actually look at the customer and say, hmm, this
one doesn't look like it's – they're going make it, we're going to put it into non-accrual? How does that process

Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely, within reason. Yeah. Hey, we're pleased actually given everything that's happened in
the first half of the year that we have actually generated positive operating leverage. But the back half continues
in this state of sort of unknown variables. So, we've dialed it in. The message that I want to send is that we're very
conscious and deliberate and disciplined around our expense management and we'll work hard. This suggests
somewhere flat operating leverage. Maybe we can do a little better than that, to your point, but that remains to be
seen.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay, okay. And then, on the deposit service charges, you mentioned this a bit, just wanted to drill down. Could
we get any sense of how much of that decline in deposit service charge was due to fee forgiveness versus just
kind of lower incidence and activity levels? Bill mentioned consumers being flushed with cash. And then, U.S.
Bank said this morning, they expect theirs to bounce back a bit in the third quarter, still be down year-over-year.

second quarter levels.

Brent Erensel Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
Brent Erensel. Thank you. It's great to have a war chest during a pandemic. I have two specific questions on the
national digital effort and the national mid-market effort. Are these actually moving the needle in terms of the
revenue wall that you and other regional banks are hitting? And then, the second question would be on what
you're seeing in Midland and the MBS – commercial MBS experience, if you could update us on that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Well, just on moving the needle on revenues, and I'll let Rob throw some figures at you in a second, but the
C&I space, where we have been at this for a number of years, it's starting to become a meaningful part of the total
revenue inside of our C&IB franchise and it's growing at a much faster pace than our legacy markets including
fees. We're maintaining the cross-sell ratios that we had in our legacy markets. The retail effort in terms of
profitability at this point is probably a drain, almost certainly a drain, but it is affording us the ability long-term to be
able to fund the growth in our C&IB expansion with core deposits as we build out our retail franchise. Collectively,
it's profitable. I don't know [indiscernible] (00:47:07)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The only thing that I would add to that is that, yeah, the expansion markets in C&IB are doing quite well.
One question we get is what's the progress on the opening of Seattle and Portland, which we had teed up for this
year. We have in fact hired there. It's a little bit slower than what we had planned for 2020, but we're growing. And
each of those markets contributed significantly in terms of the line draws that we saw and the loan growth that
we've seen.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. On Midland loan servicing, I think we're the largest or close to it of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, one of the largest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Servicers in the CMBS market both on the master servicing side and importantly on the special servicing side.
Thus far, we have seen as much as $0.5 billion a week, I think, the number is, plus or minus...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Rolling into special servicing out of a balance. But we actually have a little over $200 billion in special servicing.
About $150 billion of that is pure CMBS, and our guys would tell you that in the crisis, we saw $12 billion move to
special servicing. They're expecting as much as $20 billion through this...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And we're a little less than half of that. [indiscernible] (00:48:24).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. We're half of that now. That is – and as an aside, that's – obviously, those aren't our assets. We are paid
money to service those. We get paid a fee stream when they move into special servicing. We get paid a very nice
interest stream when we advance on principal and interest, and ultimately, we also get paid on resolution of those
assets, another fee stream. So, it's large, it's accelerating and it's profitable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan K. Gill A
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Just to clarify, we're the designated special servicer on $200 billion of – I think you said we had $200 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Oh, yeah. Sorry, we're designated [ph] specialists (00:49:10). We do it for others [ph] with our cash (00:49:13).

Brent Erensel Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
So, you're profiting – you're enjoying unusual profitability from this. Did you do this 10 years ago as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Yes.

Operator: Next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I was hoping you could help me get a better sense of
what the order of magnitude is in terms of how much PPP fees can actually help your net interest income and
how much is sort of baked into your outlook, because you have about $13.7 billion of loans and – it may not help
you as much as some other regional banks, but certainly not chump change. And if we do assume that a sizable
proportion of that is forgiven and if I just run 70% to 80% – and I don't know if that's the right number – and a 3%
fee on that, we're talking about a few hundred millions of dollars accrued over – or recognized over a few
quarters. So, I want to get a sense as to whether you think my intuition and I guess my estimates are right, first of
all. And then second of all, Rob, I don't know if you've given or you've estimated – or sorry, provided numbers or
how much is incorporated into your revenue guidance for the full-year and your NII guidance for the third quarter. I
don't know if you can give any sense as to the numbers there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, one, it is built into my full-year revenue guidance in terms of the PPP fees. Most of that in terms of what
I'm thinking about right now would be in the fourth quarter. So, not so much in the third quarter. And then, I think
the issue is to what extent maybe some of that goes into 2021. So, it's a real number. But in the context of our
total NII for the year, it's not hugely material.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
Yeah. It's not hugely material, but if we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, it certainly moves the
needle in a given quarter or even in a half a year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
But is that – am I thinking about it correctly in terms of what percentage could be forgiven. I know there's huge
uncertainty around that. But we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here in revenue that will be
collected over the next three – or recognized, sorry, over the next three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right, and like I said, that's built into my guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. All right. Okay, thank you.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2020
So, Rob, I have a question for you on credit, and I wanted to – I guess at first, I'm actually more of a bourbon fan
than single malt, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I was waiting for that to come up a little sooner, but I understand. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q

It's 12:00 o'clock somewhere, I think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right, right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
But really – I guess table 12 shows I guess that one single mall REIT that's in the [ph] NPA formation (00:52:54).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[ph] You almost got it (00:52:58) there. But can you talk about the criticized trends in the commercial book, I
guess, quarter-over-quarter, I guess just thinking about it with some of the forbearance and those kind of things?
You don't necessarily see it in the past dues. So, I guess I was wondering where the overall criticized commercial
loan trends were quarter-over-quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, no. So, it's up, I would say, sort of mid-teens. We will report that in terms of our reports, but criticized are up
[ph] as we expected (00:53:30).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But one way to look at that is – I don't remember the exact breakdown. But when Rob went through the reasons
for the increase in our provision, both economic and then specific credit, that $500 million plus or minus...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] $557 million (00:53:45).

William Stanton Demchak A

Was effectively the result of downgrades of credit. So, you can think about that population that's been affected
here as being covered by the downgrades that gave rise to that $500-plus-or-minus million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q

Got it, got it. That helps. That helps. And then I guess maybe...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And I just want to clarify it's a single mall REIT related credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:54:11) single mall REIT, exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[ph] You need to (00:54:12) say that fast, yeah, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And maybe just one real quick follow-up, and the guidance, you talked about [ph] core (00:54:23) expenses and
revenues and the positive operating leverage targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe the longer term thought, Bill, on you guys have been able to function pretty well with your digital
investment with a lot of branches that you haven't reopened yet, right, because of the pandemic. I guess, is there
any sort of thoughts longer term about maybe not reopening some of those and closing some of those branches,
even though you still have the digital – or you still have the branch expansion strategy nationally, but any thoughts
on culling some of your end market branches?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes, there's additional thought. Look, I think – and by the way, that wouldn't show up in run rate near-term
because at this point, it'd probably cost us even dollars...

...to close something as it does for the savings. But what's clear is consumer behavior has changed, and my belief
