Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Mark. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I hope you and your
families are healthy and well. Like so many around the world, we at Northern Trust are deeply concerned by the
tragic events unfolding in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. Northern Trust has made
contributions to humanitarian relief efforts and has matched contributions from our employees to maximize our
impact.
While we have minimal direct exposure, the crisis brings unique challenges. The broad use of economic sanctions
and market restrictions means that we, along with our peers and counterparties, have been called upon to play a
role in implementing the world's response. The crisis has added to the uncertainty in the current environment,
including volatile markets, supply chain constraints, and persistently high inflation, but we are navigating this
challenging backdrop.
Our performance in the quarter generated a 9% increase in revenue compared to the prior year and a return on
average common equity of 14.2%. Revenue growth reflected organic growth across each of our businesses, as
well as the impact of rising interest rates. Compared to the prior year, our results generated approximately 2
points of positive fee operating leverage and 1 point of positive total operating leverage.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
We continue to have success executing on our growth strategies across each of our businesses, while enhancing
our foundational strength through advancements in our data and digital efforts. In our Wealth Management
business, we are growing across each of our regions and our Global Family Office business. We continue to see
strong levels of engagement and new business with both new and existing clients. Later this week, we will host
our second-annual virtual Wealth Planning Symposium, which will bring together experts from across the country
to share planning strategies and perspectives to support the needs and interests of our clients. The theme of this
year's symposium, Wealth, Redefined, builds on The Northern Trust Institute's 2022 Wealth Planning Outlook,
which examines how shifting values have given investors the resolve to pursue what matters most in our rapidly
changing world.
Within asset management, we saw strong year-over-year organic growth across key strategic areas of focus,
including our FlexShares ETFs, which surpassed $22 billion in asset, up 13% for the quarter. We saw a strong
growth in funds that traditionally offer inflation protection, including our Global Natural Resources Fund. We have
continued to expand our FlexShares' ESG and climate funds with the recent announcement of the launch of a
fund with exposure to emerging markets. This fund builds on our existing suite of climate ETF, which currently
includes US large cap equities, developed markets, and two fixed income funds.
Our Asset Servicing business continues to drive organic growth across regions, products and client segments.
Our client focus and flexible global operating model continue to support our strategy. And our pipeline remains
strong. At the start of this year, we combined our Corporate & Institutional Services team with our global services
operational team, creating a single integrated business unit with operational expertise focused on serving the
needs and providing solutions for our institutional clients around the world. With this change, our Corporate &
Institutional Services reporting segment has been renamed Asset Servicing.
We recently released our 2021 Philanthropic Impact Report, which highlights our commitments to our
communities through charitable contributions and the many hours of volunteering from our staff. Our employees,
the heart of Northern Trust are extraordinarily talented and caring, and I commend their efforts in serving our
clients and our communities.
To close, we remain focused on our long-term priorities and investing wisely for future profitable growth to deliver
long-term value to our various stakeholders.
Now, let me turn the call to Jason to review our financial results in greater detail.

Thank you, Mike. Let me join Mark and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's dive
into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 2. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of
$389.3 million, earnings per share of $1.77 and our return on average common equity was 14.2%. Results for the
quarter included $18.5 million and reclassification of certain fees that were previously recorded in other operating
income or as a reduction to other operating expense that are now included in trust, investment, and other
servicing fees. Of that amount, $6.9 million relates to fees previously recorded in other operating income, with
$3.5 million now included in Asset Servicing trust fees within the other category and $3.4 million in Wealth
Management trust fees.
Additionally, $11.6 million that was previously recorded as a reduction to other operating expense is now included
in Asset Servicing investment management fees. Prior-period adjustments have not been reclassified and these
reclassifications resulted in no impact, pre-tax or net income.

Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was up 9% and
expenses increased 8%. Net income was up 4%. In the sequential comparison, both revenue and expenses were
up 3%, while net income was down 4%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million in the current quarter.
Return on average common equity was 14.2% for the quarter, up from 13.7% a year ago and down from 14.5% in
the prior quarter.
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Trust, investment and other servicing
fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1.2 billion and were up 10% from last year and
up 5% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $81 million in the quarter, up 3% year-over-year and
up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by higher client volumes and
market volatility. The remaining components of non-interest income totaled $88 million in the quarter, down 12%
from one year ago and down 25% sequentially. Within this, security commissions and trading income was up 4%
from the prior year and up 1% sequentially.
Other operating income totaled $41 million and was down 25% from one year ago and down 43% sequentially.
The decrease compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the previously referenced $6.9 million
accounting reclassification. The sequential decrease was primarily due to gains from property sales in the prior
quarter, the aforementioned accounting reclassification and lower distributions from investments and community
development projects. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $388 million and was up
12% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust and investment piece on page 5. Our newly named Asset Servicing
business piece totaled $662 million and were up 7% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Custody and fund
administration fees were $453 million and up 2% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year
growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency
translation and lower transaction volumes.
The sequential decline was driven by lower transaction based fees and unfavorable currency translation, partially
offset by favorable markets in new business. Assets under custody and administration for Asset Servicing clients
were $14.5 trillion at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth
was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.
The sequential decline was primarily attributable to unfavorable markets and currency translation.
Investment management fees in Asset Servicing of $147 million were up 27% year-over-year and up 30%
sequentially. Their year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business, the previously mentioned
$11.6 million accounting reclassification and favorable markets. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to
lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and the accounting reclassification. Fee waivers in Asset Servicing
totaled $28 million in the first quarter, compared to $51 million in the prior quarter and $28 million in the prior-year
quarter.
Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $1.1 trillion, flat year-over-year and down 8%
sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by market declines and client flows. Securities lending fees were
$19 million, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Average collateral levels were flat year-over-year and
down 4% sequentially. Other trust fees were $44 million, up 9% compared to the prior year and 24% sequentially.
Both the prior-year and sequential increases were due to the previously referenced $3.5 million in accounting
reclassification. The sequential performance was also driven by higher seasonal benefit payment services fees.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $506 million and
were up 14% compared to the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers in Wealth Management
totaled $23 million in the quarter, compared to $30 million in the prior quarter and $22 million in the prior-year
quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. For the
sequential performance, the growth within the regions was primarily driven by favorable markets, lower fee
waivers and new business.
Within Global Family Office, the year-over-year performance is driven by new business and favorable markets.
The sequential increase is mainly related to new business and lower fee waivers. For both the regions and Global
Family Office, the previously referenced $3.4 million in accounting reclassification also contributed to the year-
over-year and sequential increases. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients was $396 billion
at quarter end, up 11% year-over-year and down 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven
by client flows and favorable markets. While the sequential decline was driven by client flows and lower markets.
Moving to page 6. Net interest income was $388 million in the quarter and up 12% from the prior year. Earning
assets averaged $150 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. Average deposits were $139 billion and
were up 10% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $40 billion and were up 16% compared to the
prior year. The net interest margin was 1.05% in the quarter, and increased 5 basis points from a year ago, driven
primarily by volumes and mix, as well as higher interest rates.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 5%, average earning assets grew 1%, and average
deposits grew 2%, while average loan balances were down 1%. The net interest margin increased 6 basis points
sequentially, driven by primarily higher average interest rates.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter and were 8% higher than the prior year, and up
3% from the prior quarter. The current quarter's expenses included the impact of the $11.6 million accounting
reclassification, which increased other operating expense. The prior quarter included a $9.5 million charge related
to severance and the pension settlement. Excluding these impacts, expenses were up 7% versus the prior year
and up 3% sequentially.
Excluding severance charges in the prior quarter, compensation expense was up 9% compared to the prior year,
and was up 12% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher incentives and salaries.
The sequential increase was primarily due to higher equity-based incentives as well as higher salaries. The
current quarter's equity incentives included $49 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff,
compared to $32 million in the prior year.
Employee benefits expense was up 1% compared to the prior year and was flat with the prior quarter, excluding
last quarter's $3.4 million pension settlement charge. Outside services expense was $213 million and was up 9%
from a year ago and down 5% from the prior quarter. Revenue and business volume expenses accounted for just
over one half of the year-over-year growth. The remaining year-over-year growth reflected higher technical
services and consulting expenses. The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower technical services,
consulting, legal and third-party adviser cost.
Equipment and software expense of $194 million was up 10% from one year ago and down 1% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher software support, rental and amortization costs. Occupancy
expense of $51 million was up 1% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. Other operating expense of $80
million was up 11% from one year ago and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by the

accounting reclassification, partially offset by lower miscellaneous expenses. The sequential performance was
impacted by the accounting reclassification, partially offset by lower business promotion expense.
Turning to page 8, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier ratio of 11.4% under the
standardized approach down from the prior quarter's 11.9%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.5%, down from 6.9%
in the prior quarter. An increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a
primary factor in this quarter's decline in capital ratios. During the quarter, we purchased 295,000 shares of
common stock totaling $34 million, and we declared cash dividends of $0.70 per share, totaling $147.8 million to
common stockholders.
The current environment continue to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance
sheet profile to support our clients' needs. We continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and
solution expertise they've come to expect from us. Our focus remains on balancing a variety of factors in the
months ahead with the prospect of continued higher interest rates benefiting our net interest income and
inflationary pressures impacting our expense base. As our trust fees are impacted by both quarter lag and month
lag markets, the negative markets in the first quarter will be more impactful for us in the second quarter. We
continue to be relentlessly focused on strengthening our competitive positioning within each of our businesses,
investing in our workforce and technology, all while delivering attractive returns.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark,
Lauren, and I are happy to answer your questions. Jennifer, would you please open the line?

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. I guess, I wanted to just unpack a little bit the outlook that we should be thinking about with regard to the 2022
expenses. I know that you have talked in the past about pressures on the business from inflation, et cetera. But
this quarter came in really nicely and it seemed like there was quite a bit of expense management going on. So, I
just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking through that?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Yeah. Let me start with the biggest volatility maybe, and I think we should give some comments on the
compensation line and then if it's helpful to touch on one or two others, I can. So, the biggest piece of the increase
is obviously the retirement eligible equity incentives, which as you know, Betsy, it's in first quarter. That was just
about $30 million last year, but it was around $50 million this year. So, that increase was driven by higher levels of
grants reflecting stronger relative 2021 performance, but also the changes in retirement eligibility of staff who are
actually receiving those grants. That's an important distinction.
So, if you take out that $50 million seasonal increase, that would imply that our comp run rate is flat from fourth
quarter, but there are some important puts and takes in there. So, first, salaries were actually up $5 million to $10
million. And that's a combination of some of the strategic hiring and the plan that we described to address the
labor environment through some targeted off-cycle base pay adjustments.
Secondly, that amount was offset by lower severance, currency translation, and some other small items that were
favorable in this quarter. So, if you look forward on the comp line, I'll give you three nuggets. One is, we know that
annual base pay adjustments are going to be up $20 million that hits in second quarter instead of a more typical
run rate for us, which is about half that level. Two, we're still going to be doing some projected hiring and some
other adjustments, and that could cause an incremental $5 million to $10 million lift next quarter. And then lastly,
just a reminder that, as pre-tax income changes, our underlying incentive levels are impacted and that's important
to keep in mind just because of the potential increase in rates, and that could have a meaningful impact pre-tax to
drive that line. So, hopefully that's helpful on the comp line, which I think had the biggest volatility.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. No, that's great. Thank you. And then just a follow up question on how we should be thinking about
buybacks for the rest of the year. We've got some market volatility obviously impacting AOCI, just thinking about
whether or not, as you're planning through the rest of this year, does the AOCI matter? You, obviously, have still a
very strong CET1 and TCA to TA so, so maybe the answer is no, but given the back of [ph] win rates (00:22:23)
already Q-to-date, it looks like we're going to have another slug of this AOCI hit in 2Q, so how should we think
through those dynamics?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You're exactly right. And even we were 25 days or whatever into the quarter. And we're already close to –
we're $350 million plus in impact to AOCI for second quarter. And so, we obviously have to keep line of sight on
that. Now, that said, you're also right, first of all, we absorbed the AOCI hit in the first quarter pretty well. CET1
capitals was down just about 6%, the CET1 ratio stayed well under the 11s, 11.4%.
And so, we absorbed it well, but you know that we're going to keep an eye on what we look like relative to peers
in terms of capital and what happens with AOCI, it's a big lever. And the quickest thing we can do to address that
is making sure that we're prudent about how we think about buybacks. And that's one of the big pillars we look at
as we think about capital action.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Just to make sure, when you said you were $350 million plus, are you saying that if you had to close the
book today, your AOCI hit would be $350 million more than it was last quarter. Is that what you mean? Or less
than?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Jason. Hey Mike. Hope you guys are well. So, obviously, lots of discussions around the
trajectory of balance sheets in this rapidly changing market backdrop with interest rates picking up in QT. Relative
to last cycle, it looks like Northern's balance sheet has increased materially more than it did in the last cycle. And
in last cycle, deposits overall have actually hung in relatively well compared to the rest of the industry. So, maybe
help us think through the latest thinking on both the mix of interest bearing to non-interest bearing deposits and
kind of how that's going to evolve to your best kind of crystal ball capabilities? And then ultimately, the overall size
of the balance sheet, how you expect that to evolve with QT?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, on mix of the deposit and interest bearing and non-interest bearing, I think the more important factor
there is, do we hold on to the operational deposits in the Wealth space. That's a big driver of value overall, the
way we think about it. And so far, we have not seen cash – we haven't seen deposits moving off the balance
sheet. However, have to anticipate that that's going to come at some point, given the Fed actions and also just a
rising yield curve where 25:54 clients think about what their options are laddering out taking some duration. And
so that's super important for us. We want to maintain those high-quality deposits.
There's another group, of that's more on the Asset Servicing or institutional side. Even within there, there are
some very high quality core deposits, but some of the more sophisticated clients will move those dollars around
and so that's just unpredictable. What we have seen so far that has created more movement that's been
meaningful is out of the money market funds. And already we've seen – and you can track this on our website and
in the industry, you've already seen clients in general and the industry moving out of money funds and whether
they're moving into ultra-short or other a little bit longer duration product, or whether they're moving into more risk
assets is difficult to tell. Then on – so that's a little bit on mix.
On size, if you go back pre-crisis, the balance sheet, the deposit level was like $80 billion, $85 billion and you look
where it is on average now, much, much higher. And so, I think we have to predict it's going to come down some,
but things are just different at this point and we anticipate that the balance sheet is going to hold in closer to these
levels and not give up dramatically what we saw pre-crisis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, following up along the same lines, kind of reading between the lines your
comment around wanting to hold on to some of these core deposits, any thoughts around deposit betas and
maybe how they may be similar or different versus what we saw in the last cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. For us, compared to last cycle when everyone was anticipating a move at that time and no one could really
predict are we going to end it at 1% or 1.5%. Every move seemed like you wanted to make sure you're handling
betas the right way, because it might be the last move. In this instance, we know that we're going to get rates
moving a lot. And so, I think that's something to think about differently strategically. We want to make sure, again,
we hold on to deposits with our good clients, particularly knowing that it's going to take a while before the Fed is
done with these actions.

And so, already – and you saw we had very good results in terms of raising net interest margin, even given the
fact that the Fed didn't move until very late in the quarter. That said, our bias is going to be hold on to client
activity and hold on to client assets, particularly given the fact we think it's going to take a long time before things
level out and the yield curve has reflected all the Fed actions that they're contemplating.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey, Jason. Good morning, guys. So, follow up on the NII discussion. Last quarter, you gave us a rule of thumb
on how much each hike would give you both in terms of a growth basis and then how the deposit cost would act
out? I was just wondering if you might be able to update us, just given that so much has changed, if that's still a
net $35 million for each $25 million. And just any general thoughts on how you would expect NII to [ph] traject
(00:29:46) from here, given Alex's points and just the magnitude of heights that are now expected? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Well, let me answer your question directly, and I'll give you some broader thoughts that you asked for. So,
first of all, the $35 million, we did say, that was the first hike. And on a run rate basis, that played through well.
The good news is that even with that, that contemplated just the short end, the very short end of the curve moving
up, but the overall yield curve has moved up. It's not as helpful, but you'll get more lift as we get more as we get
benefit from reinvestment. So, let me use that as a transition to your other question, because you're right, NII is
certainly on a sharp trajectory.
So, the eventual outcome is likely very dependent on the pace of change and, again, what the shape of the yield
curve looks like. So, instead of giving an overall rule of thumb, let me give you some of the key sensitivities, so
you can sharpen your estimates as the key factors develop. So, three big buckets on earning assets, one, on
cash, the key item to remember is only 60% of those assets are in the US dollars, sometimes people forget that,
and I think that's important to remember.
Two, securities portfolio, a higher percentage are in US dollars, but only 30% resets in 90 days or less. So, just
over $1 billion of the long-term securities are getting reinvested per quarter. We're currently experiencing about 85
basis points of reinvestment benefit on that reinvestment tranche. That translates to just over a couple of million
dollars in lift quarterly for the long-term portfolio.

And then third, loans, virtually, all of that is USD and about three quarters is tied to short-term floating rate indices.
And so, I gave you some comments on the liability side, but that breaks down earning assets in the three
categories. And so, hopefully, that's helpful in thinking through the math as different things happen across the
yield curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Very much, so thank you. And just a follow up in terms of asset mix and growth, just on the prior questions
about capital, the period end loans and securities were both down. Is that just a function of the deposits or is the
change in capital causing you to change anything regards to where you want to see asset growth or securities
portfolio duration, et cetera?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. No – headline is no change in philosophy. And the way the balance sheet works from – once the deposits
come in inside the balance sheet, the first determination is where do we need to hold cash across different central
banks for various activities. And then the second is, what is loan demand? And the third is, therefore, what do we
do with the securities portfolio? And so, the loan demand is what really drives effectively in this environment, the
size of the securities portfolio. You did see in this quarter what looks like a bigger move between cash and the
securities portfolio. But that's not strategic. Some of the investments we make are more just classified. It's more of
a classification in that three category bucket between cash and securities, but there's nothing happening
strategically there.

Adam Q. Beatty Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just wanted to drill in a little bit. Are you basically following on the discussion that we were just having around
Central Bank Deposits and kind of a need across different geographies to have those in place and kind of what's
been driving that and then what's the outlook, particularly on the non-US front in terms of potential interest rate
increases? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. It's driven by largely just the activity and predominantly the Asset Servicing business. And so, as we bring in
deposits that are non-USD denominated, we need to keep cash and liquidity on hand for matching purposes and
then we might even have agreements with different central banks to make sure that we've got funds on deposit in
those institutions and so the headline is, it's driven vastly by the mix of international business on the Asset
Servicing side.

Great. And then, if I could, I'd just like to drill into the loans and particularly the yield on the loans. You kind of
alluded to the rates supporting that. I was wondering if there was any change in the mix of the loan book that also
contributed to the increased yield? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. No, nothing – no, I mean, you have seen over time some of the – more of the residential portfolio coming
down. But overall mix is relatively stable overtime, nothing that would have a meaningful impact on the net yield of
the loan portfolio.

Good morning, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Jason, can you give us kind of a rule of thumb, obviously, your assets under management in custody are
skewed to equities? And can you share with us, is it primarily domestic US equities that is comprised in that
number? And second, is there any a 10% increase or decrease in equity values leased to an X percent or X
percent decrease or increase in revenues in Asset Servicing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Mark, do you want to take it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Gerard. It's Mark. So, when you're looking at the investment management fees themselves, it's probably a
pretty good balance between both. We look at EAFE Local and S&P 500 just as guidelines. EAFE Local, just
because that removes the currencies out of it. When we do look at the equity market sensitivity just based on the
asset allocation, a little bit more than a third of the Asset Servicing investment management fees are equity
market sensitive. And those do happen both on a quarter lag as well as a month lag.
And then if you move up to the Asset Servicing custody and fund administration category of fees, we said before,
about 40% of those fees are not asset sensitive. They're based on transaction volumes or fixed fees or fund level
fees. The remaining 60% though, there is equity sensitivity there, that too is quarter lag, and month lag. If you look
at that line overall, the custody and fund administration line, I think $453 million in fees, about 27% of that would
be equity sensitive. Just based on how the current allocations are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you for those insights. And then, just as a follow up question, obviously, with the short-term
interest rates moving higher, your money market mutual fund fee waivers will eventually go away. And if the Fed
raises rates in May by 50 basis points, will they be eliminated by the end of the second quarter, or what's the
schedule there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Ironically, we should split the waivers into two categories at this point. One is, what do waivers obtained as a
result of interest rates forcing yields below stated fees? That first hike in mid-March, eliminated – it absolutely
eliminated those fees, the waivers. Conversely, the business has decided to keep some waivers in place – some
fee waivers in place for strategic reasons. And that's adding up – they won't do that perpetually, but at least for
the time being, they think that that's important strategically, again, in the spirit of keep client assets and make sure
that we're attractive relative to our peers. That currently is on a run rate of $10 million to $15 million a quarter. And
that will persist, but again, not perpetually.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, right now we're at [ph] above 2/7 (00:39:49). And we were – I'd say, at the upper end of a range that we
feel comfortable in. And so, if there's any bias, it might be a little bit down. But again, the team looks very
opportunistically what's available in the marketplace and where we see good value. But right now, ticked up to
[ph] above 2/7 (00:40:15), just under that and then overall the balance sheet is – the overall asset duration is [ph]
1/1 (00:40:24).

if that persists or not, we'll have to see. Certainly, there has been some pickup and at least what you would think

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Hey, good morning. If you could talk more about this internal restructuring that formed the new Asset Servicing
segment. I assume that's to increase wallet share and market share with your institutional clients, if you could
verify that? And also, just by Zip code, if you don't have the exact number, what kind of share do you have with
these institutional clients now, and this restructuring will kind of get you to what kind of targeted market share or
something in the ballpark, you have 2% share, looking to 4% or 5% going to 10%, and is my premise correct as to
why you restructured?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, Mike. It's Mike. The primary reason for integrating those two parts of our company are to be more aligned with
the clients and being able to provide better service for them. So, we really are trying to integrate everything from
the front aspect of our business to client servicing part of it through operations. And just the scale of our Asset
Servicing business now is such that it made sense to integrate those parts of the business. So, that's the overall
aspect of it or I should say, objective, is better client service. I think that there are added benefits to it as well,
certainly, from an efficiency perspective being more aligned.
And then, to your point, if we are effective in doing that, should it increase our wallet share? Absolutely, over time.
But I would think about wallet share a little bit differently in the sense that that can vary based on the type of client
that we have. So, just a little bit of context there. If you think about asset-owner clients, maybe start with the
corporation that has a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan. We may be the Asset Servicing
provider to one or hopefully both of those. And so, by providing better service, if it's only one, you're absolutely
right, the objective is to be able to do for both then we have examples of that in this recent quarter.
And then, on the asset manager side, there again, it's going to depend on the asset manager. If you think of the
largest asset managers in the marketplace, we are a Asset Servicing provider to them. To your point on wallet
share, it may be a minority proportion of their overall business on that front, but given the magnitude of the size of
the client, it still can be a very attractive client for us. And the reason why that works that way for those largest
asset managers is, one, just the sheer magnitude of what they're doing and the need they have, they want to
have diversification of providers, you've certainly seen that in the marketplace. But also, they have many more
different fund types, they're in more geographies and so, they look to have best-in-breed, if you will, depending on
the fund and the location and other factors.
Now, that said, as you look at other large asset managers that are not the largest, but say, $50 billion to $100
billion in assets under management, there we're looking to have, I'm going to call it a 100% market share. But
essentially, we're looking to do everything from them front office through middle office and including back office or
custody. And so, in those cases, it's critical since we're their operational partner there, that we're able to provide
seamless service for them. And this integration between the C&I business group that we had in global services
into one unit enables us to do that better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And aside benefit efficiency savings or not? Or is it really about the customer and share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Definitely about the customer first. My belief, Mike, is that we will get efficiencies over time. But just to be clear,
when we put these together, and you can see in our results here, it did not involve a reduction in force or a charge
17

or anything like that. And that's because we're looking at it to make the business stronger and provide better
service, not to try to cut parts of the operations out.

Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
I'm wondering if you could stick with fee revenues a little bit more and just talk about the organic growth trends
both in the quarter and as you see them for the rest of the year in Asset Servicing and in Wealth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Let's start on Asset Servicing and first of all, even though you saw not as strong of a lift relative to prior
periods, we did have positive new business in the period and if I kind of do a further double-click into what we
talked about earlier, new business was slightly positive, I'm just talking sequentially. Market impact was a little bit
of a lift, and then, to Mark Bette's point, transaction volumes, that was a big drag. As we look forward, we do see
good one not funded business and the pipeline there is strong. And so, it's above average for the business. And
so, the near-term looks positive and then, you look a little bit further out, it's not as clear, but the activity seems
fine there as well.
If I switch down to Wealth Management, you'll see that the GFO business really stood out and I'll unpack that a
little bit if it's helpful. We saw just, again, sequentially, a meaningful increase there, about $10 million or $11
million. $5 million of that was from waivers, but another $5 million of that increase came from higher average
balances, particularly in the money market mutual fund space. And the reason that I call out the money market
mutual fund space is that's another area we're coming – and at the end of the year, balances were quite high.
And because they're in funds and those are daily charged fees, we got the benefit of those funds sticking around
the first couple of months of the quarter. But as we look into second quarter, the launch point is a little bit lower.
Just a couple of million dollars, but it's just something that's noteworthy. But overall, you do see that Family Office
18


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
business is doing well and it is underlying good client activity or some of our strongest, largest client choosing to
do more with us.
And then, if you look at the regions, a similar story overall, just not as large in terms of movements. But positive
from a net new business and flows perspective, waivers helped there a little bit, and markets helped, and then the
accounting change shows up a little bit as well. And part of what you're seeing there and the regions not doing
well, day count had an impact in the regions of a few million dollars, so they had to offset that coming from fourth
to first quarter, but again, strong, particularly in the Family Office business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And maybe just to follow up on that, I think there's been some commentary and maybe an uptick in
competitive intensity in the ultra-high net worth space, so maybe you could comment just broadly on the
competitive intensity you're seeing in Wealth generally, but especially in that ultra-high net worth or GFO type
segment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Mike, do you want to start?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. You're absolutely, right, I mean, it's a high level of competition, but that's what we look to differentiate
ourselves from, and as you heard in some of my opening comments there, we really try to differentiate based on
the advice that we provide, the expertise that we have, and then certainly the services and the performance that
go around that. And candidly, the numbers are demonstrating that that does make a difference.
If I step back a little bit and just look at the environment we've been in for the last couple of years, it's been a
strong environment, healthy environment for wealth creation, and particularly for that segment of the market. So,
it's a time period where you've seen a high level of sales of family businesses, given the demand for that, the high
valuations, concerns over changes in tax law. So, high level of activity and then I think we're well positioned for
that.
Not only do we have relationships with families over time, but also we have a very strong relationships with what
we consider centers of influence, so think about attorneys and bankers, investment bankers that work with these
families that we've been working with for long periods of time as well. And a good portion of our new business
comes from those relationships as well. So, it's been a good environment. We think we provide a differentiated
proposition to those clients and prospects. And it's a competitive environment, but one that, again, we think that
we stand out favorably.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple. Firstly, what's your expectation for deposit betas on operational
versus non-operational deposits as you look out over the first 100 basis points and then the next 100 basis points,
given that we may have a lot more rate hikes this time, if you can parse that into the operational versus non-
operational?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
I don't know if we'd want to try and cut it that finely. And you can imagine there are some clients where portion of
the deposits are crossover categories. And so, I think for us, it's just looking at what does the market give us and
we're not a price maker in the deposit side. And this is very much working with clients and thinking about the
relationship holistically. There are oftentimes with large holistic relationships where thinking about deposit pricing
can be something that's part of the overall narrative of and pricing around the relationship. And so, difficult to
make high-level comments about where our expectations are there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's right. That's right, Jason.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I can give a couple comments on – I think the big one's the equipment, software, and outside services. So,
on outside services, that came in lower than it was in fourth quarter and big drivers there, consulting and legal, but
a lot of just consulting costs were lower. And some of those matters matured more quickly. But we may still get
back to that fourth quarter run rate, but more like the end of the year. It's hard to say at this point. But we have
20


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
been able to get some of those more consulting-related projects down. And then, also technology services costs
were down despite the fact that market data costs were up, because of good business activity. So, I think that's
notable.
And then on equipment and software, that's relatively flat from fourth quarter. And so, if we look at that sequential
period, no significant headlines, it's more driven by the timing of some of our anticipated spending. However, I will
say that over the remainder of the year, we can see depreciation coming in and that's going to start to hit. We can
see that from what's now already in the pipeline and that could accelerate and there could be another $5 million a
quarter starting in second quarter for the remainder of the year.

Dean Stephan Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. This is Dean on for Glenn. I just had a quick question around T+1. It looks like the SEC is looking
to implement T+1 by the end of next year. So, wondering if we could just get your thoughts on why this move
might be harder versus prior settlement reductions? Any estimates around how much time and money it'll cost
you guys to get there? And then, I guess just broadly, the positives and the negatives of shortening the settlement
cycle? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. A relatively technical question there and we can follow up, I'll say, with the experts on some aspects of it.
But what I would say is, we've been moving, and I think the industry as well, for some time period to shorter and
shorter settlement times. And that has actually, I think, been very beneficial to the industry, to our clients, and I
view this as a continuation of that. Now, where it ultimately ends as far as settlement, don't know exactly and as
you know, it cuts across different markets and different types of securities.
But from a client service perspective and what we offer, we've tried for some time period to be able to provide
real-time information. So, even if the settlement may occur at T+1 or T+2, we have the ability to do it on a
settlement basis. But then also the ability to do it on a real-time basis in some circumstances or at least a T+0
basis. And so, that's been the movement for some time period, you're right, it absolutely requires investment in
technology, changes in processes and controls to be able to do that. But the direction of traffic has been that way
for some time period, and we think that will continue.
