Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Salvatore J. DiMartino
Managing Director & Director-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the
management team of New York Community Bancorp for today's conference call. Today's discussion of the
company's second quarter 2021 results will be led by Chairman, President, and CEO, Thomas Cangemi.
Before the discussion begins, I'd like to remind you that certain comments made today by the management team
of New York Community may include forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements we may make are subject to the Safe Harbor

Now, I would like to introduce New York Community's Chairman, President, and CEO, Thomas Cangemi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2021
performance. Joining me in our Long Island headquarters are our Chief Operating Officer, Robert Wann; and our
Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto. Also joining on the line from Flagstar Bancorp are Sandro DiNello, President
and CEO of Flagstar; and Lee Smith, President of Flagstar Mortgage.
As you may have already seen, Flagstar reported strong second quarter results today. We also announced better-
than-expected results for the second quarter of the year. This is the second consecutive quarter of better-than-
expected quarterly results. I'm very happy with our strong operating performance this quarter, which was
highlighted by continued expansion in our net interest margin, lower operating expenses, good loan growth, solid
credit quality, and most importantly, a substantial improvement in our earnings per share.
In fact, this is the company's best quarterly operating performance in over 15 years when we reported EPS of
$0.35 back in the first quarter of 2005. On a non-GAAP basis excluding mostly merger related non-recurring items
of $12 million, diluted earnings per share were $0.33, up 57% year-over-year and $0.03 or 10% ahead of
consensus estimates.
While diluted earnings per share were $0.30 a share, up 43% on a year-over-year basis. As for the details of the
quarter, starting with our net interest margin, our second quarter margin was 2.5%, up 2 basis points sequentially.
Prepayment income was very strong during the second quarter, increasing 35% to $27 million, compared to the
first quarter of the year and added 20 basis points to the margin, compared to 15 basis points in the previous
quarter.
Excluding prepayment income and the impact on holding excess liquidity during the quarter, the net interest
margin increased 5 basis points to 2.3% compared to the prior quarter ahead of our expectations.
Our pre-provision net revenue was also strong during the current second quarter. Excluding merger-related
expenses of $10 million, PPNR totaled $218 million, up a very solid 38% year-over-year.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Another highlight of the quarter was our efficiency ratio, which improved to 37% compared to 40% during the
previous quarter. Total operating expenses decreased 43 million or 2% compared to the previous quarter, which
was also better than what we anticipated.
Moving onto deposits. Total deposits at June 30, 2021 were $34.2 billion relatively unchanged on a linked quarter
basis. However, this masks the significant progress we are making on our deposit growth strategy since the
beginning of the year.
If you look at the average deposits, they've increased $2.3 billion or 14% compared to March 31st. This was
primarily driven by deposits garnered from our relationship with our technology partnerships, which increased to
over $3 billion during the quarter before settling back to $1.1 billion.
Since being named CEO, it has been one of my top initiatives to bring in more core deposits from our multifamily
and commercial real estate borrowers. These initiatives are beginning to bear fruit as loan related deposits at
June 30th increased $380 million at 22% annualized to $3.9 billion compared to December 30, 2020 balances.
As a result of these initiatives, CDs as a percentage of total deposits have declined to 26% as of the current
second quarter, compared to 38% in the year-ago quarter, while total deposits have increased.
We will continue to focus on growing deposits to a variety of strategies including by further penetrating existing
borrower base, as well as expanding into the banking-as-a-service base through partnerships with fintech
companies.
On the lending front, we had a relatively good quarter in terms of loan growth. Total loans held for investments
increased $449 million or 4% annualized on a linked quarter basis of $43.6 billion. The multifamily portfolio
increased $345 million or 4% annualized, compared to the first quarter of the year, despite an elevated level of
prepayments. While the commercial real estate portfolio declined modestly, especially finance portfolio continues
to grow in its growth trajectory increasing to $3.4 billion or 7% annualized compared to the previous quarter.
As for our credit quality, our metrics continue to be very strong and rank among the best in the industry. We
reported another quarter of net recoveries while NPAs improved slightly. More importantly, 60% or $1.5 billion of
the $2.5 billion of deferrals paying interest only have returned to full payment status.
We expect to see a notable improvement throughout 2021 as we move closer to the full reopening of the New
York City Metro region. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our total COVID-19-related deferrals have declined
substantially to $1 billion or 2% of total loans compared to $7.4 billion or 17% of total loans this time last year. All
the while, we're actively working with our borrowers and not incurring any losses.
In terms of the local economy, our outlook continues to be a positive one. Our portion of the New York City real
estate market to non-luxury rent regulated multifamily market portion is performing extremely well. Rent
collections continue to be at the same level as they were before the pandemic and all borrowers have plenty of
liquidity. While we remain vigilant for any signs of weakness, we are looking forward to the full reopening of the
region in the upcoming months.
Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on our planned transaction with Flagstar Bancorp. We are making
significant progress on multiple fronts. Integration teams have been formed. We meet at least weekly, if not daily,
on the integration planning process. To-date, a number of key decisions have been made including selection of

the technology platform and ancillary systems we will use and the product and service we will offer our combined
customers.
In addition, in an 8-K we filed yesterday subject to the completion of the planned merger, we have named our
senior executive leadership team reporting directly to me and who will support our strategic priorities going
forward.
All necessary regulatory applications for the merger have been filed. The joint proxy statement was sent to both
sets of shareholders last month. The next milestone is both companies' special meeting of shareholders to be
held virtually on August 4th followed by an estimated closing early in the fourth quarter which is subject to all
required regulatory approvals.
Since we announced the merger, I've been spending more time with Sandro and his executive management
team. And our shared vision of the combined organization is more evident as each day goes by. This, in my
opinion, is not a traditional merger. It is an alliance where we are taking the best of both companies and forming a
much stronger, better positioned organization and creating significant value for everyone.
The more time I spend looking at the two companies becoming one, the more excited I become about the
combination. In addition to compelling financial metrics including double-digit EPS accretion and immediate
tangible book value creation, there are significant deposit growth opportunities, new lending opportunities, and a
substantial amount of fee income opportunities by cross-selling Flagstar's retail products set through the NYCB
branch network.
This is where the benefits of scale are readily apparent. The combined company will rank at or near the top in a
number of key businesses, and given a bigger balance sheet, we will have the opportunity to leverage up a
number of businesses and/or increase market share. These businesses include both direct and indirect
multifamily lending, mortgage warehouse lending, mortgage banking, as well as expanding traditional C&I lending
into each of our markets.
With that, we would be happy to answer any questions you may have. As stated earlier in the call, both Sandro
and Lee are also here to answer any questions you may have on their results and their business model. We will
do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining. But if you don't, feel free to call us either today or
during the week. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question
comes from Steve Moss with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just starting here with margin expectations and loan pricing here, good quarter here in
terms of the underlying core, just kind of color there, you could give, Tom in terms of where you're seeing pricing
going?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So obviously, interest rates have changed significantly over – throughout the second quarter. But the good news
for us is that, we're still holding around that significant. We'll call it 275-ish spreads to the five-year. So, we're
seeing anywhere from three to three and an eighth on a traditional product on the multi and respective
commercial probably getting 30 to 40 basis points above that.
But as far as overall economic returns on the business, as you can see the prepayments have been relatively
strong. And despite the level of prepayments, we still grew the book. So, we're excited about growing the portfolio.
We're still anticipating that mid-single-digit loan growth for the company. And I would say, and if you think about
margin with the fact that we have around that 3% type of yield coming back onto the portfolio and holding our
portfolio at a reasonable growth trajectory for the year. Our cost of funds is still declining slightly. So, we anticipate
further decline in our cost of funds as we move into the second quarter.
So, I'd say, we're probably looking at I mean, between 3 to 5 basis points of margin potential expansion in Q2. So,
the ongoing continuation of the expansion is occurring as we set ourselves up for the business combination with
Flagstar, which will bring a lot of liquidity, more importantly a lot of balance sheet opportunity on the wholesale
side that we're going to evaluate.
We haven't been specific as what we're going to do there. It's not baked into the merger math, but we have a
tremendous opportunity to look at our combined wholesale liability portfolio as we bring in the excess liquidity.
And we'll make a business decision as we get closer to the – the closing of the transaction.
So, excited about the ongoing, continuing margin expansion even though, we've enjoyed a very unique
opportunity over the past few quarters. I'd say, it's been almost a year and a half now of reductions of our cost of
funds and improvement in the margin. We anticipate that to continue as we focus on the consolidation of the
business model into 2023. Sure.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
That's helpful. And then maybe one question for Sandro here. Just Sandro, just kind of, if you could give us an
update on your thoughts on the mortgage banking market and kind of where you see things playing out. I do see
the guidance in the deck which is kind of color around that and what your underlying expectations are with the
adverse market fee coming out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Steve. Nice to hear from you. Yeah. Look, we think that the mortgage business is – continues to be very
strong. The projections by the GSEs and the MBA continue to look for a very, very strong mortgage market.
What we've been trying to do, as you know, you've been following us, is build a consistent mortgage revenue
stream. And I think we've found our way there. And it's shown not only in what we've done this quarter, but also in
what we're guiding to, for next quarter. So, we feel very good about the consistency of the mortgage revenue. I
think what you see today is, we hope will be sort of on a run rate, if you will, plus or minus 10%, over the long-
term. But let me let Lee be a little bit more specific about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Sandro. Thanks for the question, Steve. So, just giving a little more color to what Sandro said. In
terms – volumes are holding up, Steve. So, the agencies and the MBA have got 2021 at a $3.9 trillion market;
2022 at $2.7 trillion; 2023 at $2.4 trillion. And then when you look at the primary spread, it's been pretty constant
over the last several weeks between 125 and 135 as have the gain on sale margins.
Furthermore, given our diversified mortgage model, we're able to find pockets of opportunities other originators
cannot. And so, what I mean by that is we originate in all six sales channels. We have a balance sheet which
gives us available for sale health reinvestment and MSR flexibility. And we have an RMBS program which
provides execution optionality.
We executed on four RMBS deals in Q2. And we're the third biggest issuer of RMBS in the quarter behind
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. And we're planning on five deals in Q3. And as the GFC step away from
certain product classes such as non-owner occupied, we're able to step in and take advantage given our balance
sheet and our MBS program. The key, as Sandro mentioned, is being consistent and we want to bring
consistency to our mortgage earnings and gain on sale revenues, because we have so many different levers, we
can pull to make that happen.
So, in the second quarter, our guided to $150 million to $170 million of gain on sale. And in Q3, I'm guiding to
$160 million to $180 million. The relevance of that is, if we're generating north of $150 million gain on sale in the
quarter, Flagstar is going to generate over $2 earnings per share for the quarter or $8 annualized. That's a lot of
capital and firepower for Flagstar and ultimately, the combined company.
And I want to be able to provide that consistency and reliability from mortgage every quarter. And when the
market provides opportunity through interest rate drops, we can generate even more earnings and capital.
And finally, with the bigger balance sheet that we're going to have of the combined entity, it's going to give us
growth opportunity from a mortgage point of view around the HFI portfolio, holding more MSRs, the RMBS
program, bigger balance sheet. We can hold more inventory, expanding new and existing origination channels
and support in the 238 New York Community Bank branches and their customers as well.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
And Lee, relative to the GFCC, that was eliminated. Maybe a couple or a quick comment on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, it's helpful. And we've seen a pickup in our pipeline from a mark-to-market point of view. And from a
balance sheet point of view, given that we're delaying deliveries until after 8/1 when that removal goes live. But if
you think about it that 50 bps, it equates to about a 10-bp higher mortgage rate for borrowers.
So, while its elimination is positive for prospective refi volume, it's not going to have a material impact. I think what
is interesting more recently has been the drop in the tenure to around 125. And we've definitely seen an increase
in refi volumes as a result of that. And combined with the FHFA removing their refi fee, it's helpful. But the
removal of that fee in and of itself won't drive a ton of volume, but it's certainly given us a bump or pickup on our
pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you for all that color and great quarter on both sides.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

Thank you, Steve.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brock. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, Tom. I'm doing well. Hey, going back to multi-family, could you talk about the activity levels
there and how much of the activity that you're seeing is purchase versus refi? And more generally, has the
corrective phase within that asset class really shaking out at this point or where do we stand there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, obviously, it's been relatively slow in the past few years. But more importantly, what this focus of the
pandemic and coming out of COVID, there's been a lack of activity, but we've done pretty well with our customer
base

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Refi has always been significant. As you can see from the quarter, we had significant prepayment activity. So,
we've held a lot of those deals. A lot of them did trade away and we're still good to books. So, we were very
pleased with that.
I'd say that we're looking forward to the second half as being more of a growth year opportunity for us. We still
feel confident that we can grow. We'll call it the core multi-family at that 5%-type growth rate. I think where the
interesting opportunities might be is when we combine with Flagstar. This is going to be a growth story.
And I don't think anybody really has the anticipation of the capital infusion that will go into the combined entity.
And we can significantly increase our exposure to a lot of Sandro's great relationships over Flagstar including
warehouse, commercial real estate, and on the builder finance. These are positions that were extremely well
managed on their end, and they are capped at a certain level.
But when you put a significant infusion to capital on a combined basis – we've done it when Richmond County
merged with NYCB. We were capped at $50 million a customer. Now, we have substantial hundreds of millions of
dollars of exposure to the best borrowers. I believe that type of growth opportunity will be there for us.
Now, we're not giving projections for next year until we close this transaction. But there's no question that the fact
that the companies are combining, we can increase the best customers with an opportunity to grow with us. At the
same time really go after the deposit opportunity throughout the branch network. So, we're excited about the
second half, it's not going to be a double-digit on a stand-alone basis, but we think we can make that 5% net loan
growth number.
And as far as the specialty finance business, it's doing really well. We have about $2 billion excess sitting out
there undrawn because of the supply chain issues and people managing their overall capital stack given where
capital markets are right now. But ultimately as business picks up, we think they'll draw down and we see that as
also a potentially high-teen grower as well. So, we're excited about this company combining. We think it's going to
be a growth story as well. And that's going to be, I think, a catalyst for investors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And just following up on the multifamily. What's the latest in terms of the threat to 1031 exchanges? Has the
discussion moved on this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, you know, it's interesting. That's an interesting question because obviously if I had that answer, it would be –
everybody would be surprised, for everyone to understand it. But clearly, there's no question that it's in people's
minds. We ask – I ask my top customers all the time. Is it positive? It is what it is. It's a tax strategy that may or
may go may – may not go away. But right now, it seems like it's losing a little bit of momentum. It's a big issue for
commercial real estate.
What does it do for us? Ultimately, the assets stay on longer assuming they take it away. But the jury is out if it
goes away. It's a pretty big benefit for both the commercial real estate owners. But more importantly, the city does
transact. They get significant economic benefits from transactions that work within the New York City
marketplace. So, I think that will have implications to the budget of New York City.

So, as we dive into these tax strategies and right now, it seems like they're stalling. 1031 is always – is always an
issue for long-term investors. But they'll find other means to look at the value. They'll take out – they'll cash out
refi and they'll maybe able to take less cash out refi, but they'll cash out refi if the value is there and ultimately,
hold the asset a lot longer. They'll look at situation such as looking at the other tax opportunities that are out there,
well there are several not as meaningful as a 1031. But there are several opportunities such as the opportunities
no one that is taking advantage of. And ultimately, they'll plan their estate accordingly. But no question that a
1031 removal was not going to be a positive for the sentiment of the owners.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, I was wondering since, it has been a few months since the announcement of the deal and you mentioned
you've done some additional work and discovery on opportunities to enhance the performance just on a combined
basis. Can you just frame that more quantitatively to any extent you can? Just some of the opportunities you
expect on either the loan or deposit growth side or the fee income side?
I know you've mentioned the strong deposit opportunity previously, going after deposits at Flagstar's current
warehouse customers for example. That sounds like a great shot on goal. Can you just quantify maybe how large
that pool is that you're seeing there now and what you think the chances are you can capture some of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, we see so many opportunities as we spend time together as the two management teams are really working
very hard to get to the finish line here. What's most important is that when you look at the announced transaction,

none of those attributes are in the deal. Right? So, we have this double-digit EPS accretive transaction with
tangible value creation. So, we're not forecasting the benefit of a quarter wholesale shift from wholesale to retail
deposits. That's going to be a significant benefit as we decide where we're going to go with our liability structure.
There'll be tremendous opportunity to look at the combined entity. We're liability sensitive, they're asset sensitive,
combined, they can choose our positioning as the Fed has to make their decisions towards the end of the year as
to where they're heading with interest rates. That's a significant catalyst for us. If you think about the opportunities
we discussed on the previous question, on the growth opportunity.
They have some very strong relationship. They are number two in warehouse in the country. And we believe we
can hold that and grow it very nicely as I look at the best customer base that they have and expand into sizable
concentration opportunities at very low risk. It's a very low risk business model that comes to warehouse, if
managed well. And they do a really good job with that. So, excited about that opportunity. All their best customers
will be reignited by having a capital infusion.
So, we've done it before. As I indicated when we – Richmond County merged with NYCB, we've significantly
increased our CAGRs on loan growth. So, the loan growth opportunity is going to be real from the capital infusion
in a combined basis. We're running just south of $90 billion in a pro forma basis. And this is going to have a lot of
liquidity regarding the escrow opportunities through the – inside those business model. And there's going to be
some opportunities to deposit a spot in the warehouse. They turn away the deposits. They have so much liquidity.
We will accept that.
At the same time...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Right. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
At the same time, they were also looking at tremendous opportunities on banking-as-a-service. It's an initiative of
mine. If you saw my announcement last Friday, we're reallocating resources to building out a digital platform and
more importantly banking-as-a-service. We had a win in the first quarter. It was our first win.
I believe we just got another one last night, actually two for the second quarter. This is going to build up to a nice
line of business for us as we focus on getting our fair share of the payment space over time and trying to catch up
on the technology side. So, we're excited about that.
But collectively, there's so much opportunity on cross-selling products. I mean, on the C&I side, we really don't do
much at all other than hold our balances on C&I. We're going to be in the C&I business. We get our fair share of a
local market with our market share. We should do very well on growing other lines of business and we'll call them
verticals that we haven't done in the past.
So, we're excited about a full-service commercial opportunity over time. We don't want to give any guidance right
now until we get closer to closing and we'll talk about the opportunities. But I think, Dave, over time, investors will
look at this as a growth story with a tremendous credit enhancement here. So, we know obviously both
companies have a tremendous track record on credit and the businesses that we're in are very low-risk credit
profile.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe just switching gears drilling in a little bit more on the warehouse lines. This quarter,
it looks like the balance held in fairly well just given the industry trends. I was just wondering how you see that
both trending from here just given the mortgage activity forecast out there. I know you've talked about the cash
window cap. It actually helped drive some more warehouse volume in the market. Can you just talk about how
you see that book turning from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Dave, we're super excited about the business. I'm going to defer to Sandro and Lee on this, because
obviously they run that business currently. We're going to stand by that and make significant investment we
believe is tremendous opportunity. But I'm going to defer to both Lee and Sandro on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Hi, Dave. Nice to hear from you again. Well, look, from Flagstar's point of view, we – if we were – as we run
the business independently, the way we look at the warehouse businesses, we take as much as we can get in the
warehouse. So, whatever the market gives us, we're going to take. And so, when the mortgage market is really
strong, our balances are going to be higher. When it's less strong, they're going to be a little bit lower.
Now, in the meantime, given the upcoming combination of our two companies, we are looking at every
opportunity that we can to expand the lines that we have with existing customers and also to talk to customers
who were too big for us previously. So, I think we can mitigate some of the natural reduction and balances that we
might see in a smaller mortgage market because of the business combination.
But really when you look at the Flagstar balance sheet, you can't – don't get too focused on just the warehouse
business because what we've been able to prove quarter-after-quarter is that if warehouse goes down, something
else goes up.
And it depends on where the opportunity is. And that's the beauty of the diversified commercial business model
that we have. And that's why our net interest income is very consistent over time. And if you look at that, look at it,
quarter-over-quarter, you'll see that we're going to be $180 million net interest income, plus or minus 5% to 10%
every quarter.
And if you believe that that is a run rate for Flagstar, then don't get focused on any one line of business because
in any given quarter, builder finance may be lower or higher and warehouse may be lower or higher. But we
managed to the total and then we managed to the net interest margin. And we've been able to show a very stable
net interest margin throughout all the economic scenarios whether you're talking about before the pandemic or in
the pandemic or now. Our net interest margin went up 8 basis points this past quarter.
So, we managed to the total, and we don't worry about what might be weak or strong in any particular area. We
look for the opportunities to offset that in other areas. And then when you add the consistency of the mortgage
business that Lee spoke to, if you can get yourself comfortable that the guidance set or the results that we've had
recently and the guidance that he – that he's comfortable giving you that that's there and as Lee said, the
combination of what we're doing in our commercial banking businesses and the mortgage business.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
I'm just talking about Flagstar now. You get yourself very comfortable, I think, that $2 a share for this company on
a quarterly basis is pretty possible. And when you convert that to the combined company, that's a contribution of
$0.50 a quarter to the total, so that's $2 a share contribution coming from Flagstar to the NYCB total on a
combined basis.
That's what's powerful here. And that is before talking about the synergies that you asked about. And it's hard for
us to answer that question right now. But I ask you, don't focus on what the possibility is. Just focus on today,
right? If you believe NYCB can make $0.30 a share a quarter and if you believe Flagstar on a converted basis
based on the exchange ratio can make $0.50 a share, $0.80 per share per quarter, over $3 a year. I mean, look,
the value here – I think the value potential is just outstanding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. I agree. Thanks for all the detail. Maybe just one last one on expenses, Tom. Those were better than
expected this quarter. What are you thinking about in terms of the trajectory going into the end of the year here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We've been working hard in keeping the expense line, obviously at a very conservative level here, we've
budgeted approximately $130 million, we came in about 128-ish, John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
129.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
129-ish. Again, I think it would be relatively flat Q3, $130 million. I'll give you some guidance for the year but since
if we have to take the guidance off the table because hopefully the deal is closed by the fourth quarter, by $500
million quarter run rate for 2021, we're doing a little bit better than that. So, 130-ish obviously Q1 versus Q2 is
lower predominantly driven by payroll tax issues -- the high quarter for payroll tax.
But we're pleased. We're very pleased. We're focused on efficiencies. I think there's going to be some
opportunities as we combine in the longer run. When we look at automation and technology, we are focusing on
getting ourselves caught up on being able to be more efficient by utilization of the Fiserv conversion from the
previous year.
We have opportunities as we look at the combined entities. We believe that we will clearly achieve our estimated
cost savings on the transaction. But we think there'll be more opportunities as we look at initiatives on dealing with
robotics, artificial intelligence, focusing on the technology and issue that's going to get ourselves caught up to the
industry as we move towards more of a commercial banking model.
So, we are spending a lot of effort on the tech side and we believe there's some great opportunities to even make
ourselves more efficient via the tech side.

All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

your question.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. Tom, regarding the deposits that came in from the relationship with Fiserv, can you give more –
more color on the nature of those deposits and what drove such a wide fluctuation through the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'm going to defer to Mr. Pinto. He'll go through some of the progress. But just to be clear, that's one of many
initiatives we're working on. So, we plan on building a banking-as-a-service initiative. But I'm going to defer to
John to specifically go through the program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. With that program, Steve, that's related to the economic impact, stimulus payments both round one, two,
and three. So, there's a large portion of it that came from the third program. So, what happens is, when those
debit cards are sent out to the individual consumers, the individual people, they start using them. As they're used,
the deposit balances start to trend down.
So, as you can imagine, it ramps up very quickly and then there's an initial drop over a month or two, which is
what we saw in the second quarter, as Tom mentioned in his opening comments, where we peaked over $3
billion and have now come down to $1.1 billion as of June 30.
And then what happens after a couple of months is that decline starts to slow down as people either use part of
the card and leave the rest on the shelf for a little while. So that's what we've seen. We expect it to roll down
much more slowly in the second half of the year. So, we believe it'll be – it'll have a little duration here for us. But
as Tom said, this is just the first of hopefully many banking-as-a-service opportunities that we'll have to bring in
deposits from our technology partners.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, Steve. I will tell you that as of recently we found out we just – we anticipate two more to come on this
quarter. I believe last night we also got another anticipated win and we had a one about a week ago. So, for the

third quarter we should have two more programs coming on board. One is fee generated. The other one is
deposit generated with zero cost of deposits.
We have another large one that's in the pipeline. Well, we're crossing our fingers, we're working hard to try to win
these deals. And it's just diversifying who we are as a company looking at the funding base. We really want to
move away from our dependency in wholesale finance. And ultimately – and going back to my initial comments,
we won closed to $400 million from our customers from Jan 1 through June 30th. That was from our lenders
going back to our customers and getting our fair share what's ours which is our deposits. So, it's an initiative. It's a
culture now, we're changing the culture here.
We're doing lending and you have to have your deposit relationship. So, we talked about initially my strategy, the
low-lying fruit to be taken from the customer base that's ours. We have the technology. We have a strong
partnership with S. The commercial servicing banking platform is standardized. People are very comfortable with
it, and we're going to expand upon it.
So, when we do loans, we wanted deposit relationships. It's not just lending and trying to find the funding; it's
getting the loans and getting the deposits as a combination of the business relationship. And we're proud of that.
So, our lending team and our retail strategies were working hard together. The handoff goes from lending to
retail, and they close the deal and putting them onto private banking. And we picked up $400 million.
It's a pretty good start. I didn't want to give too much excitement on the initiative because it's just under $4 billion
now. But it's a nice growth trajectory for us. I think we're going to have further wins. We are looking at lines of
credit for our best customers and part of that lines of credit is that they also bring in more deposits. And it's been
working well for a very wealthy property owners who have been doing business with us for multiple decades. It's a
culture that the board has clearly accepted. And we're going to move forward with this, but it's going to be the way
we do business going forward. It's going to be about changing the culture on the deposit side.
We have to fund our balance sheet more like a traditional bank model and that's the goal. So, over time, we like to
see some more room on the reduction of the wholesale. I think it's exciting to look at the combined benefit of
Flagstar and NYCB combining. We have lots of optionality as we try to figure out where rates are going. We have
lots of liquidity.
I mean at this point in time Flagstar has liabilities that are funded out to other banks. We'll take it. We'll bring it
back onto our balance sheet and look at our wholesale position, and, hopefully, we reduce our dependency. But
over the long term, we want to fund like a traditional commercial bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Tom, if we stay with the $4 billion of deposits from loan customers, one, how do you size that potential? And what
is it you're doing to get that kind of growth? Are you just basically bundling the pricing with new loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Steve, very simplistic. At the end of the day, our business is a relatively short portfolio. It's not long-term
finance. You're going to get a shot at these customers over and over again, let's say average life of 2.5 to 3 years.
So, as they come back to us, it's part of our culture. It's a requirement.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Historically, a lot of transactions were waived. We're not changing our pricing. It's just getting our share of what's
owed to us which is the operating account, the lease security deposit accounts, working with extending lines of
credit that they have, other lines of businesses that they're more than willing to move their relationship from, let's
say, the money center bank.
Maybe they're moving from your company to the – from JPMorgan to over to NYCB. It's focusing on, if you want
to bank with us, you want – if you want the money to put out, we want to have here deposit relationships,
especially if we have the technology to service it, and I think it becomes part of a cultural request.
It's not – nothing new in banking, just that, historically, culturally, it wasn't a priority of the bank. I'm making that a
priority of my leadership. It has to be done. That's how we're looking at the business going forward, in all
businesses. And once we start ramping up, our C&I expectations in the marketplace and we expand with the
Flagstar people under Reggie Davis, we're going to be looking at these markets and bringing in deposit
relationships from the local community which we don't do currently. That's going to be another catalyst.
Now we're not going to put a growth number on that, but that's starting at zero. So, I'm very excited about that
opportunity. I know that we're going to be ramping that up as we get towards – into next year. And we're excited
about getting people out in the field and getting our fair share of the customer base that's within our – in our
marketplace. We have huge deposit share when it comes to deposits, but now we need the people in the field to
bring in the deposit relationships. So that's going to be a focus of mine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Yeah. Thanks. And just finally, so the prepayment income was obviously very strong. And just finally, so
the prepayment income was obviously very strong in the quarter. Tom, what portion of the loans prepaying are
staying with you guys and given where rates are moved, are you starting to see more now move to take
advantage of the government option like a lock-in longer-term funding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's a great question. Obviously, we have $27 million totaling, $5 million was from our [ph] DUS portfolio.
(00:37:41). So, we have about a $600 million portfolio left on the [ph} DUS (00:37:45). That's something we don't
control. That's a securitized multifamily package and we do get that from time-to-time. But when it comes to the
business, we had a couple of one-offs. I'd say when you take out the large one-offs, we're still probably around
50%, 60%, I'd like to see higher. I think we should do better.
Unfortunately, the government's offering a very attractive financing. I'll tell you what's interesting about the
combined company. We will be offering an alternative to the government program, which is being able to offer
them capital markets activity where we can swap out their instrument to allow us to be competitive and offer
another product to keep the business and we may decide to package it up and sell it.
But we are losing some to the government and some of the larger trades that went through the quarter, it is what
it is that the customer makes a choice. But when we fight for those long-term relationships, you don't want to lose
a large pool of strong relationships, low loan portfolios. But from time to time, they make business decisions on
their portfolio.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
I will tell you that it seems like going into the second half, we're going to be very focused to ensure that we get a
lot of the bread-and-butter business, we're mining the portfolio, we're very focused on looking at some other ways
to get these borrowers to the table if rates were ever to go up sometime in the future.
This is a short book so they have to make decisions. But I'll tell you that the government has been somewhat
aggressive as to rate, but where we're going to be overall competitive as we merge with Flagstar and take some
of the capital markets activity that we can offset some of these losses that go to the government.
I mean, clearly having the derivative opportunity to embedded the same financial structure into the loan book and
work with our customers to retain the business is going to be an option for us. So, it is what it is. It's always been,
it's called the 800-pound gorilla in the room.
Historically, it's been the US government and we've done pretty well. We've gone to book and prepays them in
strong – it's been two quarter back-to-back, a strong prepay. Usually, Q3 is a generally slower in general because
of the holidays. But it's usually ramped up in Q4 and it seems that we're focused on obviously growth.
So, with the, with the current growth where we are today going into the, to the end of the year, I still feel confident
we can grow the book mid-single digits on a standalone basis, not including Flagstar.

Thanks. Hey how are you? Tom, I wanted to ask about the share buyback timing. How much time has to pass
after the merger closed before you can deploy the additional earnings? And is that something that's on the near-
term horizon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think it's fair to say it is on the near-term horizon. Obviously, we're in a proxy solicitation right now both sides. I
know that Flagstar had a great opportunity to generate significant capital. Those numbers are actually better than
expected. On a combined basis, on a very conservative assumption, we anticipate an extra $0.5 billion of
additional capital outside of our current run rate that will generate for potential capital alternatives.

And I think when the company combines obviously, we're in the midst of the closing of the transaction, assuming
we're going to want to move the transaction closed, we'll look at all capital markets opportunity including our
current dividend, which is very strong. And we stand by as well as the opportunity to look at from time to time the
buyback opportunity depending on market conditions.
Look at the end of the day, we want to put this money into growth. We think that there's a great growth
opportunity. I know it sounds interesting because the bank has not been growing at double-digits but collectively
you have a real opportunity to grow this company as a growth story and pay a very strong dividend. And
depending on market conditions, we can always move that over to the dividend and the buyback over time
depending on how much capital is generated.
As Sandro illustrated, they generate a ton of capital. We're expecting very conservative assumptions when we put
this deal together in excess of $500 million. And our FFO fully vetted cost saves go through. That's a lot of excess
capital that we would have to either grow and/or buy back our stock depending on market conditions, as well as
paying a very strong dividend. That half a billion-dollar excess includes us continuing paying our current dividend.
So, it's a significant amount of capital generation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Right. So, the pay-out ratio should improve but the absolute distribution could rise as you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Absolutely. So, in a best world we're going to look at all our alternatives but we believe there's growth. And
then, Sandro and I spend a lot of time on opportunity looking at the customer base. We're modeling that as we
speak right now. They have great relationships, they capped out. They will have significant runway when the
capital gets infused together and go after their current customer base.
And also going after on the warehouse, some larger relationships that they were just probably too small to offer
any terms, we can now offer collectively and offer them more opportunity to build that book of business. So that's
the priority. Growing the business is the priority. Reinvesting back into the company and building a better platform
for us is going to be the priority. But subject to market conditions, we will put all options on the table.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And last question, Tom, is just on the integration of the system side. How much will get done by year end
2021 versus what's pushed into the first half of 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
This is the – our largest transaction. The beauty of it is Fiserv to Fiserv DNA platform. We can't ask for a better
cause conversion. This is great. They're our partners. They're Sandro's partners. We're the – collectively by far
their largest customer. We're all hands-on deck here.

We anticipate a lot of work has been done. We will convert the systems. We were shooting for been done. We will
convert the systems we were shooting for this early on the second half of next year. So, assuming we close the
deal early in the fourth quarter we should be able to have this system converted by mid-year next year.
And in the meantime, a lot of great decisions have made. We talked about my leadership team where we've
established that. We've made that public. Just to be clear, and I stand by my alliance here, its 13 direct reports to
me, 6 Flagstar, 7 NYCB. This is not a traditional merger. This is an alliance.
We spent a lot of time culturally integrating the status of the two franchises. It's super important that we make this
company one. It's not us and them. It's combining the strengths of both sides and building a powerful combined
entity where the culture integrates. And that's the culture throughout the organization.
My leadership has been set. Now my direct reports were that their leadership and simply a blended culture. So,
we're excited about it. We'll have dual headquarters. We'll have unique verticals. And I'm going to build onto it.
And we're looking for other lines of businesses. We're not just stopping on what we have today. There are
opportunities out there. It doesn't have to be bank acquisitions. It could be lines of businesses that are out. There
has been significant consolidation that's in our marketplace and as well as in Sandro's marketplace. We should
capitalize on that.
There's going to be a lot of fall out and within the system that we want to take advantage of. So, we're excited to
close this deal. We're excited to blend the cultures and Sandro's team is excellent and we're excited to partner
with them.

Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think the question was about the integration and the integration is moving along at a nice pace. Teams are
working together really well. And I think that, as Tom said, the Fiserv relationship that we both have is a big plus.
So, I think that getting the basic system, core system converted won't be particularly difficult.
And then if you think about the Flagstar business and the mortgage side, it's – that nothing needs to convert
there. It's going to stay where it's at. So, we view this as I don't want to oversimplify it because when you when
you look at it, it's over 400 different systems that you have to deal with.
So, it's an undertaking. But I'm very, very comfortable with the progress that we're making. And I don't think there
will be any integration issues that will have a negative impact on the business operations as we get to the legal
day one and then eventually to the full conversion.

Good morning, Tom. Hey, Tom, with the new potential lending opportunities with combining with Flagstar. I was
just wondering how are you thinking about office space. And the reason I ask is obvious – the credit portfolio from
a credit standard, it's doing great but it does seem like some level of work from home is going to be permanent.
And in fact, it would affect the office value buildings longer term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, that was a – Pete, great question. That's going to be interesting to find out how that all pans out in New
York City. You know who we are. We've lent to some very strong borrowers, so the collateral that we have is low
leverage. If you think about the – well talked about criticized assets that that may lead to the office discussion, we
believe we peaked in February as far as assets moving into criticized category.
So, we're seeing an ongoing decline as they're getting their cash flow to be evaluated and moving back to a
higher rating. That's very encouraging along with a substantial drop on loans that we're paying interest only, now
a full payment. So, that trends going continue. We deal directly with our large customers on the office side. I think
we have about maybe $500 million that's sitting out there that's in the classified situation. The LTV in that book is
around 56%, it was just under 60%.
And I think we have some enough room there that – there's enough equity in the position that there's not going to
be a loss to the bank. So, we feel comfortable. They have ample liquidity and capacity to pay. And yes, there's
going to be changes in how the employees think about their office space.
As far as we're concerned, we're going to be very focused on continuing – lending to our customers. We feel
confident in building out their expectations on what their future needs are, and which is any event that they're
looking at moving out of the city, that's fine, as they're going to stay in New York City.
But they are leasing up and the actual discussions I've had with many of my customers are that at the end of the
day, they're comfortable that they could continue having a very strong cash flow and we reevaluate those cash
flow.
So, I think it's important to understand that when you think about our exposure, we're a low leverage lender. I
can't make a statement for all of the office space in New York City, but for our predominant New York City

portfolio, it's low leverage and to the best customers with significant backing, so the very strong sponsorship. And
I don't envision any losses there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And do you think that's a portfolio that it would decline overtime just given the changes from the dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It could decline a little bit. But I mean, look, commercial is commercial. We're going to be very active to bank the
best customers in our backyard. We're going to expand that into Sandro's marketplace. We're going to think about
– remember, we're going into new markets and we're going to be on the ground. So, come Florida, we'll be on the
ground in Florida. We'll be on the ground in Arizona. We're going to be – they're in the ground in Michigan and
other markets that they serve.
So, we have opportunity for future growth. And I think having the right leaders in those lending verticals is going to
bring business to the bank and we're going to do solid conservative underwriting. That's who we are culturally.
That's how Sandro's team is, culturally conservative. And we're going to do conservative lending for the best
opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then just, if I could follow-up on the core margin outlook again, I know that was one of
the first questions. But can you just clarify again what you're looking for in the third quarter and some of the
drivers to the margin after the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think the drivers are going to be consistent from the previous quarter. We're about 3 basis points. I think
my guidance was 2 to 5. We came in at up 5 in Q2. And again, that range is reasonable for Q3 or say 3 to 5-ish.
And ultimately, I think that as we bring on these technology initiatives that have $0 cost of deposit that helps us,
but we are sitting on some excess liquidity, at the end of the day, we have an opportunity here to continue to drive
down the cost. We have some borrowings coming due, not a whole lot of borrowings coming due, but some that
will be reduced next year.
We have a significant amount of opportunity ex-Flagstar on the macro hedge that we probably save about 200
basis points on $2 billion of derivatives that when we combine with Flagstar, it's not necessary to have on the
balance sheet. It's a macro hedge against the fixed portfolio that predominately asset sensitive. So, we'll pick up a
significant benefit there. It's about $40 million of pre-tax earnings coming to the margin.
So, it seems like we'll have an ongoing margin expansion throughout – going from 2021 into 2022 albeit with the
consolidation of this business model. So, what's driving it in the short-term, it's going to be a lower cost of funds
and holding reasonable yields on the multi-family side.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed
with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning. Good morning, guys. Tom, I think you have about $2 billion swaps rolling off in February. Can
you remind us how much of a boost it gives to NII and should we see that in the second quarter of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I would say to you and I think I just got on the last question, we anticipate clearly with combining with Flagstar,
the company will be asset sensitive, so having that derivative on more likely than that will be removed. So, we'll
take that off. It's probably taking about $40 million of pre-tax. It's a 2% benefit, 2%, 200 basis point savings on
about $2 billion going into next year. I think it starts in February, John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
February, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, February of next year, so assuming mid-Q1 2022 that comes off. One of many benefits we're going to
have when we combine the franchise which is not indicated in our forecast when it comes to the merger amount,
right. So, we're expecting margin expansion and we'll have optionality when we go into the transaction, right.
We're going to have a large wholesale finance book that we can make decisions upon. We have a substantial
amount of liquidity coming from the Flagstar company with respect to their escrow business and opportunities
within that client base that we will maximize value on, and look at the best use of the funding opportunities and
ensure ourselves that set us up very nicely for next year as we combine.
So, we'll have some very good optionality on how we're going to position our margin. And we're excited about the
opportunity because we've always – we're very dependent on a standalone basis go into the home loan bank to
finance the company. We want to move more towards traditional finance for a bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q

That's great to hear. So, it may have another tailwind in the first half of next year coming on. And then, maybe
Tom, if you could just – you talked about that banking-as-a-service, is that mainly just your focus on growing
deposits there or is there a credit component to it?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, right now that we haven't ruled out the credit component yet. That has been the long-term. But in the short-
term we're looking at fees and deposits and opportunities. So, we had – I believe last night we notified some very
interesting opportunities, huge opportunities. But there is a fee income opportunity. I believe we won, that's a
positive. So, we think in Q3 we'll have two more coming on, one depositary, one fee benefits.
But, clearly, utilizing our technology opportunities to go out there and get other revenue/depositary benefits,
overtime, we're looking at other initiatives which we're not – I'm not going to discuss in this call until we get more
closer to finality. But we think there's a tremendous opportunity to focus on our digital banking platform which we
– we're almost there.
We intend to build it out. And when we do build it out, we have some significant plans there and ultimately being
able to access the consumer marketplace as well as the undisturbed banking market. There's a whole host of
opportunities that are out there. We have – the individuals are – they're on their bank. They're – we think through
technology we can offer products and credit enhancements for the customer that could be something that could
be very useful as you build out this platform.
So, no question it's a priority. I called it out as a leadership role to point to the CEO. But it's important. We have to
– we have to catch up. We've named a head of digital. We're going to be hiring in that particular area. We have
some very good initiatives that are in the pipeline. I think, if all goes well this year, we should have three or four
wins this year. And we're going to build it out as we look at other alternatives that are very attractive in the digital
space including – and by the way...

Interesting. Interesting. And if I could just squeeze in one more, maybe this is to Sandro, just on the warehouse
business, obviously, it ebbs and flows with the interest rate environment. But when you're in the business for the
long haul, how do you differentiate and grow your market share in that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I'll give you the same answer regardless of what line of business at Flagstar you asked me about and it's
about providing the best service in the marketplace. And I think we do that in the warehouse business. We have
been in that business for 30 years.
And so, we know what we're doing. And customers like us and we don't always have to be the best price. And so,
I think that's why you see − you've seen our ability to once we focus on it to grow from a very small line of

business. I think when Lee and I got into our positions at Flagstar eight years ago that was a $300 million balance
in that business. And we've grown our commitments actually and we've grown that now over $10 billion and as
Tom noted earlier number two in the country behind Chase.
So, I think that the service model that we provide, the ability to be there no matter what the economic conditions
are. When we got into this pandemic there were a lot of warehouse lenders that were not providing the support
that their customers needed and we were there to pick that up. And that has allowed us to gain relationships with
customers that we didn't have before and we always keep enough dry powder there to be able to be there when
someone is in need of a lender.
So, it's all about the service equation frankly and it's proven itself to work and we're going to continue to do that.
And I think we're going to continue to be one of the top warehouse lenders in the country.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
And if I could just add. I mean, obviously being a big originator, we understand the mortgage business. We buy
loans from certain of our warehouse customers and we also offer ancillary lending services, MSR lending service
and advanced lending that can be helpful to some of the bigger warehouse customers. So, we're a one stop shop
in that regard. And I think that's all part of the service equation that Sandro just alluded to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
People come and go. We got people that leave the business. People come into the business. But there's one
company, one that's been there for 30 years providing warehouse lending in this country and that's Flagstar.

Good morning. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but just had a few follow ups. One, I think Sandro, you talked about
just the earnings power of the combined company. I mean, I look at your PPNR give or take about a $150 million
this quarter. We've seen a big resell in gain on sales. Do you still see more room to go in terms of a decline in the
PPNR power relative to Q2? If you could just talk to that because that's been a big source of uncertainty around
where Flagstar's PPNR shakes out and we look forward into 2022 and beyond?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Well, if you look at our capital, we've leveraged capital I think really, really well. And so, we're taking advantage of
the capital base that we have in the company and we maximize the return that we can give from that. Ebrahim, if
you look at 2015 through 2020, Flagstar's total shareholder return was 162%. I think that stacks up pretty well
against almost anybody.
And the reason for that is because we focus on the end number, right? How do we get to a number that gives the
market confidence, gives the market confidence that they can see value creation? And so, you've got to be able to
move left, move right whatever way you got to go in order to get the bottom-line to where you needed to be. And
that's by – vesting your capital in the smartest way possible where you can get to the growth and the margins, and
the consistency of earnings.
And so, I can't – we have never historically spoken very much about the future other than the next three months.
And we've given guidance in our release about the next three months. So, I'm not going to go any farther than
that. But I'd ask you to look at history. And if history means anything, I think you can get yourself pretty
comfortable with the opportunity for growth in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just a separate question, Tom, you talked about bringing on teams some of that under the
leadership from Reggie Davis. Should we expect any onboarding of hiring commercial lenders prior to the deal
flows? Or is this going to be more of a 2022 event? And even if so, are you already talking to folks to bring them
on early next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Ebrahim, we're extremely active. What's interesting about the consolidation way we're seeing it's to our
advantage. So obviously, Reggie has been very busy sourcing out the opportunities in our marketplaces. We're
doing a lot on leadership roles right now. Obviously, we're integrating the company culturally, but there's a lot to
do.
We think there's tremendous opportunity. We talked about lines of businesses to be – we talked about having
individuals out in the field, even down to the branch managers, having people to brand the market managers,
getting out there and going after the business that culturally what we never did here at NYCB. That's what
Flagstar is doing, but we want to do that for the combined company.
So, Reggie has a very substantial task in front of him. We're working together very well. We're excited about
people calling us both not only just on the retail side and the C&I side, but also on the mortgage side. I think the
fact that this company is getting just south of $90 billion in the mortgage space, I think we're bigger now. And I
think there's going to be a lot of excitement on Lee Smith's business that people will want to gravitate here.
So, talent is knocking which is always great, and we're looking at opportunities and we're standing by these
businesses. And we're excited about the opportunity, we talked about initially when we announced the deal. We
called it the Picasso, we started with a blank page. What are we going to paint here?
Starting from zero is a good start. We have a lot to do on the retail side. And I know Reggie truly believes that our
share is strong. We don't have our share of the loan book and we're going to get it. And we're going to get it with
people and processes and being out there and offering competitive products and work as Sandro indicated with
loyalty and trust with the clients.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

It's a great question. I don't have a specific number in front of me. John, maybe to add some insight. But at the
end of the day, Flash has always been a floating rate franchise. They look at all of their deals and they have it
pegged to a floating instrument. We've been the sixth-rate lender for the beginning of time. We will have capital
markets activity on a combined basis.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
We're going to have the tools in our tool shed to utilize with the customer base and they could put on the
derivatives to manage that on an individual basis but by culture it's a fixed rate lender combining with an
adjustable-rate lender. So, collectively I think it's a good balance.
Obviously depending on what wine grows faster will really determine the floating rate inside of it. But for the most
part, I think to be well-balanced and I'm not going to be specific on − you can do the quick math. We have a very
large multi-family book which is predominantly fixed rates. We don't do a lot of floating around in the multi-side
because we don't really offer specific derivative contracts per instrument but that'll change as we combine
But that will change as we combine and we'll have that offering for the customer base.
At the same time, we also plan on working with on a capital market side alternatives versus the government
alternative because it's difficult when your customer has to go to the government and you lose, you lose that
opportunity. And perhaps, we can capitalize on some of our partnerships that we have on the broker's side. We
have a very strong relationship with Meridian Capital. I look at them as very strong partners and we're working
with their team on getting opportunities there for the customer base, so we can partner together with
opportunities.
So, we're going to have a blended portfolio with different verticals and hopefully overtime new verticals we offer to
our customer base and have more than just the traditional lending products that we have here.
Going back to the traditional commercial bank, we are transitioning to commercial banking and we will look at
opportunities and we're going to look at conservative opportunities. Culturally, Sandro's team, our team
historically have been tremendous conservative lenders and we look at that as part of a hallmark of our business.
Any business to be going to have to have conservative attributes on the lending side for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe turning to core margin guide plus 3 basis points to 5 basis points. Curious if that's again
adjusted for liquidity like this quarter? And then I was hoping for a bit of a definition for what you're calling excess
liquidity. So, there's $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This quarter, there's $2.7 billion last quarter but I
didn't see the same adjustment. So, I was hoping for a little bit of a definition there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'm going to differ, and I will tell you that the number I gave is just – I believe anticipate I'd say the overall
margin. It depends on where we put this cash out. We have excess liquidity. I'm hoping for more growth in Q3 and
Q4.
So, obviously it's going to be mirrored by the transaction. We anticipate to close this transaction hopefully by early
fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval. But clearly, we have a margin that's continuing to rise. It's an
ongoing track record for now a number of years now, delving into the fact that transaction with further margin
expansion and we look at 2022 being another margin expansion in regards to where interest rates are. So, John,
if you want to expand upon some of the questions on the margin side.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Yeah. Just quickly. It's really not an ending deposit balance, it's an average deposit balance thought process,
right. So, if you look at the first quarter, our average non-interest-bearing deposits was $3.2 billion and then we
went up to $5.5 billion in the second quarter. So that's the change right there, that's really from that – from our first
technology partner relationship.
So that's the piece that we carved out when we looked at the margin this quarter, because as it was our first one
and we didn't really know the duration of those deposits and we did realize that it would peak very quickly and run
down very quickly and that all happened within the quarter. So, when you look at it from a quarter-over-quarter
perspective, it's down a little, but it did peak almost $2 billion higher.
So, from an average balance perspective, that's why we carved it out, because it really hit during the same
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And Matt, we talked about these other initiatives. We – I believe we have another win that we have coming on that
should be a sizable amount of deposit flows, zero cost of funds that should be attractive for the bank as an
alternative than using the wholesale markets for growth. And we also picked up, we believe we have another fee
income opportunity on banking-as-a-service. And we have a very large one that's out there. If it hits, it's going to
be significant.
So, we're very excited about alternate – looking at alternative deposit initiatives or funding strategies. We believe
that is the right direction for the bank. We believe we have opportunities in the technologies by working with
partners, not only just with our existing partnerships, but other partners that we're bringing to the table, to bring in
deposit opportunities, seeing opportunities and ultimately, potentially lending opportunity overtime with the
utilization technology.
So, stay tuned. We hope to update the marketplace soon as we get closer to getting some things done here. But
we're excited about it.

So, Matt, I'm going to be very careful specifically where I stand. I will tell you that, we're spending a lot of time
understanding where the financial services industry is heading. And then we're going to be a diversified company
where I believe, and I think Sandro and Lee believes there's going to be changes in how the block chain will
benefit banking services.
So, we are very much actively looking at how that could create value for both us on the efficiency side, as well as
business opportunities. So, I'm not going to be specific but I will tell you that it's here. We're beyond paying
attention too and working very hard, I'm looking at how it could benefit us.

Yeah. We're still looking through the potential of a combined tax rate. We don't believe it's going to move
dramatically from where we are. Maybe it'll be a slight benefit when we put the two together based on state
apportionment.
If you look at the second quarter, the reasons – two reasons why it was higher, our merger related expenses are
primarily non-deductible given the type of expenses that they were. And also New York State increased the tax
rate from 6.5% to 7.25%. So, we did have a onetime hedge to revalue our deferred taxes for that tax increase.
On a run rate basis, I would say we're just under 26%. It's a good run rate for us on a standalone perspective.
We're still doing a lot of work on the combined basis. We don't expect it to be significantly different than that
though.

Hey, how's it going? It's Andrew Leischner for Chris McGratty. So, you guys had a very clean quarter in terms of
credit and you're able to bring deferrals down further. I'm just wondering what your deferral outlook from here

looks like and what your overall outlook on New York City and any potential problem areas you foresee going
forward? Thanks.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Great question. Obviously, in our prepared remarks, we talked about the drop in the loans that were subject to
interest only. It's down to about I believe a $1 billion, $2.5 billion at the beginning of the quarter to a $1 billion at
the end of the second quarter. You'll see that continually drop. There's going to be and as we get closer to the
end of the CARES Act, which I believe is the end of this year, we believe most all of our customers will be out of
any form of relief.
We have zero clients on full deferral which is great and it's been an ongoing strategy of ours. And we've been
very good with our customers to work with them, but we're seeing significant benefits as far as the – in particular,
Manhattan, reopening in Manhattan has been very favorable. It's been the last borrower that was in the waiting
game, so our customers that are exposed to Manhattan, which was is about 85% of the loans that were
considered classified.
I think the most important note as this statement here is that we think we peaked. We think that the classified
assets peaked in February. We're seeing the trend start to decline. That will also bode well for expenses as these
assets start to decline and go back into past-rated assets. We also get the benefit of the FDIC expense on that.
So that's going to be another favorable event as we manage our operating cost.
But on the credit side, it's been a very good story. Sandro talked about his credit portfolio, very strong story, has
zero loans on deferral as well. So, very strong credit on both sides. But we're seeing significant momentum on the
reopening.
I will say that Manhattan was the last borrower to get there. The other borrowers are doing fine as early as
January. But now that we have the vaccine rolled out and the cities reopening and we see more employees come
back to work, you see a lot of the supply and demand issues when it comes to rental.
So, very strong, we're meeting a lot of our customers. They're very pleased. There's some work to do on office
and retail. But I think that'll follow as the employees and the traffic start to pick up in Manhattan. You're going to
have hopefully the theaters open up and look, the Delta variant is what it is. I'm not going to make a health care
prediction. We're going to follow CDC guidelines.
But I think it's encouraging to see New York fared well regarding the pandemic. And it's good to see the city
moving in the right direction. And our customers are very pleased and we're seeing tremendous asset quality
results because of that.

Andrew Leischner Q

All right. Great. Thanks for the color. And then just one more if I can. Was there any reason why you moved your
PPP loans back out of held for sale into to the health investment portfolio?

Thank you. Our PPP loans was down to $95 million. We were very comfortable with holding those and given
where the market was and the excess cash, we had we were just very comfortable holding those loans long-term.
So, we decided to move them back into held for investment.
