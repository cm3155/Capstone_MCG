Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Julianna. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported net income of $295
million, and earnings per share of $2.08 for the third quarter 2022. Our earnings per share grew 58%, annualized,
for the second quarter of 2022.
Total revenue of $627 million grew 55% linked-quarter annualized, and included record net interest income of
$552 million. Strong revenue growth and improved efficiency drove third quarter 2022 adjusted pre-tax pre-
provision income growth of 66% linked-quarter annualized.
Asset quality continue to be healthy with very low charge-off. Our bottom line returns are industry-leading. We
returned 1.9% on average assets, 20% on average equity, and 22% on average tangible equity this quarter.
Quarter-over-quarter, all our profitability ratios expanded and, importantly, all our capital ratios grew. With our
impressive operating margins and strong capital, we are well-positioned for continued success and to
appropriately navigate a range of possible outcomes in an environment of elevated uncertainty.
Slide 4 presents a summary of balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022, total loans reached a record $47.5
billion, an increase of $926 million or 2% from June 30. As anticipated, loan growth slowed in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, loans are up 13%, excluding the forgiveness of PPP loans, and we continue to expect the full-year
loan growth will be in the range of 16% to 18%.
Our loan portfolio is well-balanced between commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and residential
mortgage. This diversification is a fundamental strength that provides both stability and optionality to generate
prudent growth as economic cycles change.
Total deposits were $53.9 billion as of September 30, 2022, a decrease of $486 million or 1% from June 30. Third
quarter average deposit were $54.1 billion, essentially unchanged from the second quarter. Our deposit book is
well diversified by deposit type, and 40% of total deposits were noninterest-bearing demand accounts as of
September 30.
Turning to slide 5, we have a resilient balance sheet with strong capital and high liquidity. As you can see in the
exhibit on this slide, all our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter. As of September 30, 2022, we had a
common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.3%, a total capital ratio of 13.6%, and a tangible common equity ratio of 8.35%.
East West board of directors has declared fourth quarter 2022 dividends for the company's common stock. The
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 is payable on November 15, 2022 to stockholders of record on
November 1, 2022. We did not execute any buybacks in the third quarter.
Moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. As of September 30, 2022, C&I loans
outstanding were $15.6 billion, sequentially up 2%; and total C&I commitments were $22.2 billion, sequentially up
1%. Our C&I loan utilization rate was unchanged quarter-over-quarter at 70%. Our C&I portfolio is well diversified
by industry and sector.
Slide 7 and 8 show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio which is well diversified by geography and
property type and consists of low loan to value loans. Total commercial real estate loans were $18.7 billion as of
September 30, 2022, up 1% from June 30.

In slide 9, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio which consists of single-family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and is primarily originated through East West Bank branches. I would
highlight that 83% of our home equity lines of credit are in a first lien position. Residential mortgage loan total $13
billion as of September 30, 2022, growing 4% from June 30.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.
Irene?

Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on
slides 10 and 11. The asset quality of our portfolio continues to be strong. Quarter-over-quarter, criticized loans
decreased 11%, and the criticized loan ratio improved 29 basis points. Special mention loans decreased 20%
largely from upgrades of CRE loans, largely hotel loans due to improvements in financial performance and
liquidity. Classified loans were essentially unchanged. As of September 30, nonperforming assets were $97
million or 16 basis points of assets.
During the third quarter, we booked net charge-offs of $7 million or a low 6 basis points of average loans
annualized, compared with net recoveries of 6 basis points annualized in the second quarter. Our allowance
totaled $583 million as of September 30 or 1.23% of loans, compared with 1.21% of loans as of June 30.
During the third quarter, we reported a provision for credit losses of $27 million, compared to $13.5 million for the
second quarter. Our quarter-over-quarter build and reserve and allowance coverage largely reflects the current
macroeconomic outlook, which is weaker than a quarter ago, as well as third quarter loan growth. While credit
quality remains strong and the current credit environment is benign, we are watchful of various challenges
affecting the economy and our customers taking proactive actions where warranted, including conservatively
building our allowance.
And now, moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide 12. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. Of note, amortization of tax credit
and other investments in the third quarter was $20 million, compared with $15 million in the second quarter. This
is lower than what we had previously anticipated because of timing. Certain tax credit projects are delayed and
the recognition of the associated amortization expense will be in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we currently
expect the amortization of tax credit and other investment expense to be approximately $30 million in the fourth
quarter.
Third quarter 2022 income tax expense was $89 million, compared with income tax expense of $83 million for the
second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 was 23%. We
currently expect that the full-year effective tax rate will be approximately 22%, including the impact of tax credit
investments expected in the fourth quarter.
I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides 13 through 16, starting
with the average balance sheet. Third quarter average loans of $46.9 billion grew $2.2 billion or 20% annualized.
The strong growth across all loan categories drove a favorable mix shift in average earning assets quarter-over-
quarter. In the third quarter, average loans made up 79% of average earning assets, compared with 76% in the
prior quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Third quarter average deposits of $54.1 billion declined only $78 million quarter-over-quarter, remaining
essentially flat. Growth and interest-bearing deposits nearly offset the decrease in demand deposits as some
customers shifted excess balances to higher yielding options, reflecting market dynamics and a rising interest rate
environment. Average noninterest-bearing deposits held up and made up 41% of total deposits in the third
quarter.
Turning to slide 14. Third quarter 2022 net interest income of $552 million is the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing 66% linked-quarter annualized. The net interest margin of 3.68%
expanded by 45 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide, net
interest margin expansion in the third quarter reflected the impact of higher loan and earning asset yields, which
increased the NIM by 71 basis points, plus a favorable earning asset mix shift which expanded the NIM by 7 basis
points. This was partially offset by 33 basis points of compression from the funding side.
Turning to slide 15. The second quarter average loan yield was 4.75%, an increase of 80 basis points quarter-
over-quarter. The average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of 4.65% plus yield adjustments, which
contributed 10 basis points to the overall loan yield in the third quarter. As of September 30, the spot coupon rate
on our loans was 5.10%.
In this slide, we also present the coupon spot yield for each major loan portfolio through the last four quarter-end
periods. You can see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio as loans are re-pricing.
In total, 62% of our loan proposal is variable rate, including 30% linked to Prime rate and 27% linked to LIBOR or
SOFR rates. Most of the loans re-price at least monthly. I would also highlight that 43% of our variable rate CRE
loans have customer-level interest rate derivative contracts in place. We will help our customers enter into low-
level interest rate derivatives, helping to protect them against rising debt service costs. At the same time, the
loans remain variable rate on our balance sheet and the big benefits from the asset sensitivity. Additionally, $2
billion of the 86% of variable rate C&I loans also have derivative contracts in place.
Turning to slide 16. Our average cost of deposits for the third quarter was 51 basis points, up 34 basis points from
the second quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 74 basis points as of September 30, 2022, a year-to-date
increase of 65 basis points. This translates to a 22% cumulative beta relative to the 300-basis-point increase in
the target Fed Funds rate over the same period. In comparison, the cumulative beta on our loans has been 55%,
as our loan coupon spot rates increased 166 basis points year-to-date.
We started the rising interest rate cycle from the position of strength, with historically high levels of demand
deposits for East West Bank and strong liquidity. This has bolstered the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable
rate loan and securities portfolios, supporting strong revenue growth through the cycle as rates continue to rise.
We're pleased with the lag and deposit beta cycle to-date. This has come through careful deposit cost
management. As rates continue to rise, we believe our approach will continue to support an expanding net
interest margin and robust net interest income growth in the coming new year.
With 41% of our average deposit to noninterest-bearing accounts and with the growth that we have had in
Treasury management products and annualized accounts since before the pandemic, we feel comfortable about
continuing to navigate the cycle well.
Moving on to fee income on slide 17. Total noninterest income in the third quarter was $76 million, down from $78
million in the second quarter. Customer-driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $69 million, up
5

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
7%, or 26% annualized, from the second quarter and up 10% year-over-year. We saw growth across most of the
fee income lines of business this quarter.
Moving to slide 18. Third quarter noninterest expense was $216 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits and
other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense was $196 million in the
third quarter, up $14 million or 8% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and employee benefits expense.
In comparison, our sequential total revenue growth was 14%, exceeding expense growth and generating positive
operating leverage. Quarter-over-quarter, our efficiency improved. Third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was
31%, compared with 33% in the second quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income grew 17%
sequentially, or 66% annualized. And our pre-tax pre-provision ROA was an attractive 2.7% in the third quarter.
And with that, I'll now review our updated outlook for the full year of 2022 on slide 19. For the full year 2022,
compared to our full-year 2021 results, we currently expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP, of
approximately 16% to 18%, unchanged from our prior outlook; year-over-year net interest income growth,
excluding PPP, of approximately 35%. This narrows down to the upper end of our prior outlook, which was for net
interest income growth ranging from 30% to 35%. Underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward
interest rate curve as of September 30, 2022, with Fed Funds expected to reach 4.50% by year-end.
Adjusted noninterest expense growth, excluding tax credit investment amortization of approximately 11% year-
over-year, which is a slight increase from our previous outlook. With our strong revenue growth, we expect
positive operating leverage and modestly improving efficiency next quarter.
For the full year 2022, we now expect that the provision for credit losses will be approximately $80 million. This is
up from our previous outlook and largely reflects the changed macroeconomic backdrop compared with a quarter
ago.
We currently expect that the full year 2022 effective tax rate will be approximately 22%. That's slightly higher than
our previous outlook, which was for an effective tax rate of 21%. The change in our outlook reflects higher pre-tax
income and a lower amount of tax credit investment as compared with our previous forecast. We currently expect
that the fourth quarter tax credit investment amortization expense will be approximately $30 million.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Thank you, Irene. In closing, we are looking forward to finishing 2022 on a high note. Our strong operating
margins and capital give us the confidence that we will navigate the emerging and changing economic cycle well.
I wish to thank all of our dedicated bankers for their excellent work which is reflected in our strong financial
performance.
I will now open up the call to questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time,
please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our
roster. The first question today comes from with Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Good morning.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just – maybe first question just around deposit, obviously a lot of focus in terms of client behavior and given the
rising rates, the loan-to-deposit ratio has crept up 88%. One, maybe just talk about how high you think that loan-
to-deposit ratio going before you start being more active in terms of managing deposits.
And second, how does this translate into where you think the margin peaks? And for East West, would that also
mark a little bit of a peak in NII, or do you expect NII growth to continue until driven by loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There are lot of questions there, Ebrahim. I don't know if I remember them all, but I'll try to get through that. I'm
sorry. It's early for me here. Okay. So if we look at – I'm going to start with, I think, the end of your question which
probably the more important one, given where things are at right now. We do expect the margin will continue to
grow from here, right. We expect it to grow in the fourth quarter. And when we look year-over-year, we also
expect a margin and net interest income to increase in 2023. We won't go into guidance and specifics around
that, but I just wanted to make sure that that was very clear, right.
Even though the – we do expect that deposit betas will increase and have continued to increase, you saw that a
little in the third quarter results. With that said, from our loan book and our securities book, the increase that we're
seeing and the pickup we're seeing there far outpaces that.
I think on the question about the deposit and the loan-to-deposit ratio, we ended the quarter at 88%, a little under
that from an average perspective, 87% or so. We do feel comfortable increasing from this point in time. I don't
think that we have said publicly in the past and that still is our position right now. Our core funding is very strong,
and I think going to kind of the low-90s is something that we're comfortable with.

Got it. And I guess, just a separate question, you talked about the hedging that your customers have done. But
talk to us if we are heading into a recession, where you see the biggest drivers of credit risk for East West's loan
book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think at this point in time – so the hedging, I think honestly for us, it's been a balance sheet management
strategy in this period of time until this year when rates were so low. But certainly, we wanted to share that, that it
certainly protects our customers in this period of time because the debt service is easier for CRE, for multifamily,
also for C&I loans.
On the credit side, at this point in time, credit is still very benign. We – certainly, if you look at kind of the results
that we have in the third quarter, criticized loans are down, charge-offs are still very benign. As we look through
the portfolios, I wouldn't say there's an area that we're really concerned with from a credit perspective, but we
continue to monitor and continue to evaluate our portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think from a macroeconomic perspective, that's why we have increased our provision simply because with this
kind of spike in interest rate, one would expect that the economy will slow down. And so therefore, we are
anticipating maybe things are going to slow down. And however, we just haven't seen much in terms from a credit
quality issue at this point. Everything seems to look pretty good as you see that our criticized asset actually come
down and then so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Irene, I want to circle back to the NII question, just I think that's part of the reason your
stock's weak this morning. The NII guide, the implied guide for Q4, can you just put a little bit more of a clarity
around it? Because the $1.5 billion that you cite as a starting point, your actual number is a little bit lower than that
excluding PPP. I just wanted to get a little bit of a fine tune on the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think, when we look at the fourth quarter, maybe I'll just share a little bit more specifics, right. With the –
based on the forward curve at 9/30, if you kind of break it down and maybe this will help you, Chris, in kind of the
analysis, we expect the loan yield to continue to increase, right? Maybe not the same pace of the increase that we
saw in the fourth [indiscernible] (00:24:46), but close to that. On the securities side, based on the variable rate
and the nature of the portfolio, probably another 20 to 30 basis points, right?
In total, especially if you look at it from a NIM perspective, NII, I think the timing of the increase in the cost of
deposits is something where we're modeling that the deposit betas will continue to increase. And we've been very
fortunate, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks, of the lag. But I think we're just realistic as rates
continue to increase than they inch up. Bu overall, I think the guidance that we gave and the specifics as far as
NII growth at that higher end of that range, 35%, is a number that we're comfortable with at this point of time.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, just again going back to the $1.5 billion. Is that – that's the starting point or is
it, like, $1.476 billion? Sorry to get this in the weeds, but there's a big difference in the implied trajectory. I'm trying
to get a sense of whether NII into Q1 will grow off of the Q4 number that we're talking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Julianna Balicka A
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Finance, East West Bancorp, Inc.
This is Julianna. If I can jump in with the precision level that. You are looking for guidance that has the word
approximately in it. If you start with the $1.47 billion starting point from 2021, a 35% increase on that implies an
NII growth of $560 million. But an NII increase of 36% off of that implies NII growth of $574.5 million, right? Now,
we put in the word approximately because, quite frankly, whether it's going to be 35% or 36% right now,
impossible for us to tell, given the fact that some of the things, such as deposit betas, you cannot know two
months in advance.
But what we are comfortable telling you is that we are hitting at the upper end of our guidance, and we're moving
higher as we're talking about because, as Irene said, we expect our NII to continue to grow. But in terms of the
actual precision, that, unfortunately, from where we sit, we cannot provide that level of detail. So just take the
word approximately and use your judgment.

Operator: The next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark Wright Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hi there. This is Clark Wright on for Gary Tenner this morning. I just had some thoughts on capital – or, excuse
me, some questions. I mean, in terms of the buyback, the stock is now trading below where you repurchased in
2Q. How are you thinking about the buyback here moving forward into kind of economic headwinds and a revised
economic outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
At this point, we don't anticipate to do any buyback simply because we are looking at that macroeconomic
situation with the Fed making this unprecedented, like, ate spike that I think it would be prudent for us to hold on
to our very, very healthy capital ratio. The great thing about where we are today is when we looked at East West,
incredible earnings power, very high margin, high liquidity, benign credit quality issue, very strong capital ratio.
East West have always done well whenever economic cycle go down. That's where we actually make most of our
money. Well, we're very proud of our financial performance for the first three quarters so far. However, I think we
will be even prouder if actual economy situation get worse simply because we always have a very strong balance
sheet that allow us to have all the flexibility to do whatever we want. So that's the reason why we have always
been somewhat stingy in terms of not wanting to do too much buyback because having all the dry powder in place
in a downcycle may be much more advantageous for us.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Got it. Thank you. And then, if I could just pivot over to loan growth in your outlook, where are your thoughts on
the mix heading into 2023? You had strong single-family growth here this quarter. But just in terms of CRE and
C&I, where is that going to be going in at? What are kind of your thoughts heading into the next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we obviously expect loan growth to slow down compared with 2022 or 2021 simply because with that kind of
rate environment, naturally, we'll expect that investors may not – or business enterprises are not going to go in
there and start making aggressive acquisition of, let's say, commercial real estate investment or building
apartments, buying warehouses. A lot of those activities that were taking place in a much more normal interest
rate environment. Looking at in the early part of 2023, I would expect that those type of activities would slow
down.
Massively, sort of like increasing inventory is also something that I would say most likely out of the question. So,
with that, we will expect the C&I and CRE growth will most likely be coming down. So, we will provide guidance in
the – actual – at the time we'll release our fourth quarter earnings.
When it comes to residential mortgages, we are also expecting somewhat of a slowdown, simply that I would
expect that there would not be as much refinancing or even home purchases. But as of today, we're still seeing
pipeline both C&I, CRE and also in single-family mortgages. While we are seeing those numbers in the pipeline
report that feel very positive about it, we also are very prudent and looking at the macroeconomic situation and
the interest rate environment coming forward and we are taking a more conservative outlook in terms of what it
may be.

Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. And I guess first just on – back on the deposits, what's your expectation for sort
of a through-cycle beta on deposits, and does that assume that DDA stays roughly stable as a percentage of the
total?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. When – earlier in the year, I think we shared that given the expectation for where rates
were and where the Fed was moving that we thought our through-cycle betas for deposits would be about 30%.
As a reminder, in the last cycle, although a very different cycle, I'll add, our through-cycle data was 37%. As we
shared on the details of the presentation, cumulatively, our cumulative beta to-date has been 22%, quite a bit of a
lag and then also – but up right from where we were at 6/30, which was 15%.
At this point in time, given the pace of the rate increases from the Fed, we do expect that the through-cycle
deposit betas will increase from that 30%. More specifics as far as what's happening next year, as Dominic
mentioned, we'll share next year. But I'll also add that with that said, we expect the loan betas to continue to
increase and there will still be significant NII expansion.

Okay. Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then, looking at the allowance for loan loss and the growth this
quarter, should we think that the ratio of allowance to loans can continue to march up if we don't see a significant
change in the economy or that really be more dependent upon either portfolio performance or incremental
deterioration from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. I think so – when we look at our models, largely the drivers for the models are GDP growth,
unemployment, CPI, CRE and market dynamics in the areas where we have CRE loans. And also for the single-
family HELOC also HPI. As these deteriorate or change, we are appropriately booking the reserve. I think if there
are – at this point in time, as we talked about earlier, there's no major weaknesses that we see. But we want to
just be realistic and prudent, especially with where the calculations are for allowance to increase as appropriate,
that macroeconomic factors decrease. That was one of the reasons for the increase in the allowance of 2 basis
points. I'll share, of the $27 million that we booked, approximately $10 million was related to the new loan growth
that we had in the quarter.

And if I can add, Jared to your prior question about the deposit betas that Irene was answering. One of your
questions was about the deposit mix. Let me just highlight that before the pandemic, we were at 30% DDA at the
end of 2019. Today, we're at 40% DDA. We do not think we're going to go back to the pre-pandemic levels. We
are confident we're going to be above pre-pandemic because of the growth in DDA has come from operating
accounts, Treasury management products and services linked accounts. So, we have a much stronger deposit
mix than last cycle.

And also, I want to add that those accounts come from a lot of new customers or existing customers that used to
use other bank for operating accounts, because we did not offer the services. That's because East West Bank
had improved GTS product offerings that we are able to transition many of these East West Bank clients to move
their operating accounts from other larger banks to us. So, the last two years, that operating accounts growth has
been quite phenomenal. In fact, it reflects even on some of the GTS fee income growth there too.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2022
Yes. So, I was curious if you can give us an update on kind of the plan strategically as far as potentially locking in
your rate sensitivity for the balance sheet and protecting against the downside of rates potentially in the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Brandon, it came in and out. Would you mind repeating your question? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yes, yes. I was curious if you can update us on your plan or thoughts on potentially locking in the asset sensitivity
of the balance sheet against kind of falling rates into the – in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, okay, great. We have increased kind of our balance sheet hedging strategy with our asset sensitivity, as you
noted, trying to walk in, I think those are great words, our asset sensitivity. So, I can share that as of 9/30, well,
actually, we entered into trade just after 9/30 as well. So, as of today, we have about $2.75 billion of hedges and
also collars that we have entered into to help preserve our margin and our NII if and when rates fall. And that's
something that we'll continue to evaluate, looking at – with our ALCO Committee as far as what's appropriate,
given the asset sensitivity and the balance sheet of the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got you. And if you don't mind sharing, what is kind of the duration of those hedges and collars?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
They range, I think, four to five years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay.
