Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning and thank you for joining the South State earnings call. Our results for the first quarter showed
progress in many areas, as you will hear from John and Will. The area where I see the most excitement as we
start this year is in the energy created by our teams gathering again in person. We have held events across our
company this quarter that brought our people together. These events have been a welcome opportunity to spend
time face to face with each other.
You can see the power of personal relationships that are being rekindled and in some cases just beginning. Our
team has been amazing working through unprecedented circumstances and to see them so excited to be together
again is exhilarating. These relationships are the magic they create a high performing bank. And to see this
reunion is a welcome sign of the potential of South State.
I'll now turn the call over to John Corbett.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thank you, Robert. Good morning, everybody. And I hope you and your families are doing well. The economy in
the Southeast continues to thrive. It's incredibly strong. We continue to see population migration from all over the
country and construction activity is very brisk. And keep in mind, this follows a decade of slower construction after
the housing crisis. Our shipping ports, airports, theme parks, hotels and restaurants are all near record capacity
as consumers return to their pre-pandemic lifestyles.
And COVID really hasn't been an economic constraint over the last year with the favorable political environment in
the Southeast. But our clients are struggling with labor shortages and wage pressure to meet the spike in
consumer demand.
We released our earnings last night and reported earnings per share of $1.39. When you exclude merger related
expenses, our adjusted earnings per share landed at $1.69, yielding a return on tangible common equity of
approximately 17%. The operating results were solid across the board with healthy loan and deposit growth.
Excluding accretion, we had $9 million of core margin growth this quarter and good expense control. Asset quality
metrics continue to be excellent. I know the market gets spooked about a recession when the yield curve inverts.
But as we get on the Street level and we meet face to face with our clients, when we review their cash balances
and their unfunded lines of credit, we're pretty bullish on the strength and resilience of our clients over this next
year.
We closed on the Atlantic Capital acquisition in Atlanta on March 1 and we're on track for systems conversion in
the third quarter. The Atlantic Capital team has delivered excellent balance sheet growth since the announcement
last summer and really they haven't missed a beat. We remain excited about the strategic fit in Atlanta and also
expanding our new fintech and payments verticals.
Our balance sheet remains liquid and we're in perfect position for rising rates. During my 33 year banking career, I
was always taught that the most valuable part of the balance sheet is the right side of the balance sheet. And
while that principle has certainly been challenged in a zero rate environment. That is the mindset that built this
company.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Over the last two years, we felt like our deposit franchise was a coiled spring of earnings power if we could just
get the five year treasury back over 2%. We currently have 1.2 million deposit accounts that are diversified and
granular and that should lead to a lower deposit beta. During the last rate increase cycle, our deposit beta was
only 5% on the first 100 basis point increase.
We started this year with 16% of the balance sheet in cash, and then continued growing deposits in the first
quarter by 7.5% annualized and that's excluding Atlantic Capital. Also our cost of deposits fell another basis point
to an all-time low of just 5 basis points. We held our nerves and we're deliberately patient to hang on to our
excess cash during the record low rates of 2021.
This quarter, however, we began deploying the cash into the investment portfolio as the yield curve dramatically
improved. The investment portfolio grew $2 billion during the quarter from $7 billion to $9 billion, with about half of
that growth attributable to Atlantic Capital.
We still ended the quarter with 12% of the balance sheet in cash and only a 68% loan to deposit ratio. So we will
experience significant revenue improvement as we continue to deploy our surplus cash into this more favorable
rate environment. Our loan production hit $2.6 billion in the quarter similar to the third quarter. And excluding the
Atlantic Capital acquired loan balances, our linked quarter annualized loan growth was 6.3%. We continue to
believe that rising rates will slow the prepayment speeds and be a tailwind to net loan growth at our current
production levels.
Along with our earnings release, we announced that we will be modifying our consumer overdraft program. We
plan to eliminate NSF fees, to eliminate transfer fees to cover overdrafts, and to introduce a new deposit product
with no overdraft fees. We estimate that the net impact of these product changes will be about $0.08 to $0.10 per
share on an annual basis beginning in the third quarter.
And to wrap up, I want to thank our team for their great work over the last quarter and over the last two years.
When we model the merger of equals between Center State and South State and we put it on paper, there was
no global pandemic in the model. There was no recession and interest rates weren't at zero. But our bankers are
tough and they're leaders, and they've plowed ahead with both grit and grace. They worked through the
conversion and the integration, and now the bank is growing. Credit quality is pristine and our deposit franchise is
incredibly valuable again.
I'll turn it over to Will and he can give you additional details on the numbers.

Thanks, John. I'll cover some highlights on margin, non-interest income and non-interest expense, as well as
credit and the provision for credit losses. In a general sense, I'll reiterate that we're pleased with the quarter and
that we're enthusiastic about the remainder of the year, given what we believe will be a better revenue
environment.
Slide 11 shows our net interest margin trends. Q1 of 2022 was our highest quarter for net interest income
excluding accretion, up $9 million from Q4. We did have Atlantic Capital revenue for the month of March but we
also had two fewer days in Q1 versus Q4. Yields on non-PPP loans of 3.80% were down 10 basis points from Q4
and total accretion in PPP fees of $7.7 million were down $5.7 million from the fourth quarter. The ACBI purchase
accounting marks are outlined on slide 33.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Looking ahead the next few quarters, we would expect to see accretion run in the $10 million range, including
ACBI for a full quarter. Cost of total deposits reached 5 basis points for the quarter, a new low for us. Taxable
equivalent margin of 2.77% fell 1 basis point from Q4, with the lower accretion and PPP fee income causing a
differential of approximately 6 basis points. With the yield curve move in the quarter, we deployed some cash in
the bond portfolio, but we continue to have a lot of dry powder with $5.4 billion in Fed funds, roughly 12% of our
balance sheet. Non-interest income of $86 million was down approximately $6 million from Q4.
Slide 13 shows our mortgage highlights and we had solid production in the quarter at $1.27 billion. As gain on
sale margins compress and mortgage rates move up, the relative attractiveness of portfolio versus secondary
increases.
For the first quarter, 47% of our production went to the secondary market with 53% in the portfolio and
construction to perm loans are included in that portfolio number. We benefit in this environment from being a
purchase-focused mortgage company, representing approximately 70% of our production and our servicing
business should be better in the higher rate environment, but margins in the business are under competitive
pressure and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.
Our Correspondent division had good performance with $28 million in revenue for the quarter, as noted on slide
14. Our interest rate swaps business experienced good demand, but our fixed income business was a bit weaker
in spite of the market providing an opportunity to invest cash at higher rates, presumably influenced by AOCI
sticker shock at some of our clients.
Turning to expenses, operating NIE of $218 million including one month of Atlantic Capital came in a bit better
than budget with good performance pretty much across the board in various expense categories. 2022 is the first
full year after the MOE system conversion and our integration continues to progress nicely.
We also implemented this year an incentive system with division and region level measures meant to drive a
culture of ownership. Department or division level performance versus budget, whether in net income for a
revenue generating division or an NIE for a support area, is a meaningful component of incentive pay for 2022.
We believe this incentive structure will help us continue to maintain a focus on revenue growth and cost control.
Looking ahead, we'll have Atlantic Capital expenses in our expense base for a full quarter for the remaining three
quarters of the year. Its NIE run rate was $15 million per quarter. We've achieved some of the cost saves ahead
of schedule as some employees have departed before we had modeled. So ACBI's NIE run rate in March was
slightly lower than we had expected. The conversion is scheduled for late July. Given the addition of ACBI for two
more months than we had in Q1, we currently foresee NIE running in the low-230s for the remaining three
quarters of the year, possibly on the high-220s for the fourth quarter with Atlantic Capital cost save realization
offset somewhat by annual wage increases and general inflation pressures.
Moving to credit. We continue to report strong asset quality metrics. Slide 26 shows continuing low trends of net
charge-offs, non-performing assets and criticized and classified assets. $1.4 million of the $2.3 million in net
charge-offs were DDA overdraft charge-offs, so loan net charge offs were less than $1 million.
Continued improvement in economic forecasts led us to record a negative provision of $8 million for the quarter or
a negative $25 million, excluding the day one provision for acquired non-PCD loans at Atlantic Capital. In arriving
at our provision release, we rated the Moody's baseline and were recessionary as three scenarios equally this
quarter, a slightly more conservative weighting than the prior quarter.

Slide 33 outlines the total loss absorption capacity at the end of the quarter, including the ACBI preliminary loan
marks. Our ending allowance to loans was 1.14%, or 1.25%, including the reserve for unfunded commitments,
with another 38 basis points in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans.
On the capital front, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the first quarter and an additional 300,000
shares in April, bringing the year-to-date purchases to just over 1.3 million shares and leaving us approximately
370,000 shares remaining in our repurchase authorization.
As noted on slide 28, this quarter significant move-in rates has caused an AOCI swing, which led to an 8%
decline in our TBV per share to $41.05 and brought our TCE ratio to 7.05%. I'll also refer you to the high calling
nature of our investment portfolio, as noted on slide 27. Our ending regulatory capital levels remain strong with
CET1 of 11.4% and total risk based capital of 13.3%.
I'll now turn it back to you, John.

All right. Thank you, Will. This is the kind of environment when South State will thrive. Between the population
shift to the Southeast, a liquid balance sheet, steady loan growth and rising rates, we've done a very nice ramp
ahead of us.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q

...first maybe if we could talk a little bit about the – further about the asset sensitivity. Obviously, that's a bigger
story, even though stocks aren't getting credit for it yet today. But you guys look extremely well positioned there.
And you noted the 5 basis point deposit made the last time around. But I'm wondering what the underlying
assumptions are within the – I guess, it's up 4.7% in your ramp scenario, if you could remind us on that? Because
I would think given all the 12% liquidity or whatnot, you'd actually be much more asset sensitive than peers than
maybe that modeling would show me. So, just maybe some of the conservatism that I've seen in your
assumptions.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Stephen. This is Steve. Well, let me kind of give you the bottom line upfront and then tell you why we think
this. So our net interest margin was 2.77% in the first quarter. Based on Moody's consensus forecast to be 2.25%
to 2.5% Fed funds rate at the end of the fourth quarter. And with about $41 billion interest earning asset base,
which we expect to be reasonably flat, we would expect them to be at the end of the fourth quarter somewhere
between 3.2% and 3.3%. And that improvement, if it's – if the Moody's consensus is right, would be somewhere
between 15 basis points and 20 basis points per quarter starting in the second quarter.
So, as you mentioned, we are asset sensitive. It's roughly 6 basis points for every 25 basis point hike. The
reasons for that, we have a couple of slides on the deck just to kind of unpack it. Page 19 speaks to our loan
portfolio and we have about 32% of our loan portfolio is floating daily, 18% variable and then 50% fixed. If you
combine that loan – floating rate loan portfolio with our excess cash of 12%, we have about one-third of our
interest earning assets, about $41 billion interest earning assets that float daily. So that makes us – that's all part
of that assumption.
We have a slide in there, and I think we referenced a few different earnings calls, but it's page 20. And it really
speaks to the deposit beta. And what this did is it went back to our previous interest rate hiking cycle in 2015/2019
and graph the combined company to see what the betas were. And that's where you can see that we ended up at
the Fed funds rate at 2.5% and deposit beta was 5% on the first 100 basis points and 24% over the entire cycle.
So the last part is just the deposit portfolio. John mentioned it earlier, it's a granular deposit base and that's why
we think that betas hopefully will outperform in this cycle.
Page 18 speaks to the deposit mix. 60% of our deposits are in checking accounts versus our peers of 43%. And
then you can see we've added a new graph in there that describes 36% of our checking account balances are
commercial, 34% small business and 30% retail. So – and you can look at the average sizes of those balances.
It's a very granular base of 5 basis points. So anyway, I would just to summarize all of that is really two things. We
have about one-third of our balance sheet that's floating and we think the deposit base and the betas will be lower
or will be similar to what they were in the last cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And I'll just add in, Stephen as well. The rate sensitivity on that slide 19 is a static balance sheet. And the
numbers that Steve gave for the NIM improvement throughout the year also assume we continue at sort of our
expected loan growth rate. He mentioned a static earning asset base and that earning asset base should be
remixed. We're assuming no deposit growth and that some of the cash is remixed into loans in then high single-
digit range throughout the period.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. That's all extremely helpful. So that – and just the last tie-up, there's a 24% deposit beta last cycle.
Is that similar to what you're modeling in then in the current rate sensitivity assumptions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
We've modeled that our betas are turned on immediately, even though we're not certain that it is going to be the
case. And yes, we're using historical deposit betas in our modeling.

Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Stephen, just to add one other thing, we're – at this time, what's different about this time is probably for the entire
industry, but we're starting out at a 68% loan-to-deposit ratio. And so, our ability – we're not saying we're going to
grow deposits from here. We'll probably shrink some deposits, I would imagine that we're excess, but clearly, we
always are growing deposits from just regular commercial clients.
So what we're saying is that, the same thing we said last time as we're 68% loan-to-deposit ratio right now,
heading toward a 80% loan-to-deposit ratio by the end of 2023. And if you do that math and you look at our 12%
cash to assets today, it basically moved down to 2% to 3% by the end of 2023, which sort of right sizes all of that,
the balance sheet management.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And I guess, just to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
...further comment on 2023, it's based on moves like Moody's consensus has it now, which would be to hit 3% in
2023. You're going to see further improvement from that 3.20% to 3.30% range, as Steve mentioned in Q4. You'll
see improvement in 2023 margin from that point as well, if that rate environment in fact occurs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. That's phenomenal detail, guys. Thank you. And then just my only other question is around loan growth, so
how you guys are feeling about kind of this just north of 6% run rate this quarter into the rest of the year and then
the commentary around resi mortgage and portfolio and more of that production, obviously with the addition of
ACBI, I guess that's now down to a smaller percentage of the balance sheet. So could we see that resi real estate
move back towards 20% given the strength of that dynamic between portfolio and secondary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah, I'll start, Stephen, this is John and then Steve can talk about residential. But I mean, ultimately, we're a
growth company and great growth markets. Kind of our mantra is to grow everything good in the bank at an
annualized rate of about 10% through a cycle. Our guidance on loan growth, the last couple of quarters has been
high single-digits, up to 10%. As pre-payment speeds slow down with the rise in rates, we think that our current
production levels will produce that level of growth.
We're looking at April right now and we're exceeding that level of growth. We're in the double-digit range for April,
so we'll see how it plays out but we still feel the guidance we gave previously is good guidance, high single-digits
by 10%. And Steve how about the residential portfolio.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And we have a slide in there on page 13 and it speaks to sort of the production in quarter-to-quarter and year-to-
year. And yeah, only comment I would make on that, Stephen is, you know, if you look this quarter, we were 53%
portfolio, which – and then 47% secondary. If you look at that a year ago, we were 67% secondary. The main
difference is the gain on sale margins. The gain on sale margins a year ago on that graph are 4.3%. So yeah, we
sold more in the secondary. Today they're down to 2.87%, which is more in line.
So, the way I kind of think about that gain on sale margins a year ago were high, rates were low and so we didn't
want a portfolio. Now rates are higher but gain on sales portfolio margins are lower. So I would think that over the
course of the next several quarters, I'd say probably towards the end of the year, we'll get to maybe more of a 50-
50 mix. Just because we like some of this portfolio arms and other things in a higher rate environment.

Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Michael. Page 14, in our deck speaks to the correspondent division. And you'll see that over the past four
quarters or so, the revenue has sort of ranged between $25 million and $30 million. I think our guidance that
we've given you all is somewhere between $24 million and $28 million. And that continues to be our guidance. It
doesn't change.

What we're seeing – you can see on this graph that certain times our interest rates – our ARC revenues are
higher than fixed income and sometimes fixed income is higher than ARC revenues. And it has to do with the
shape of the curve. But at the end of the day, the way I kind of look at it from a big picture perspective is the
banking system today has a lot of excess liquidity. And our correspondent banks, 1,100 of them, almost 1,200 of
them, are going to either loan that money or invest that money. And so we continue to see that guidance to be
very similar to what we've had. I would anticipate this next quarter because of the change in rates and because
the 5-year and the 10-year are a little bit closer to flat, I would expect ARC revenues to be a little higher than fixed
income. But at the end of the day, I don't know that there's anything major has changed in our guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's very helpful color, Steve. And then maybe just going back to the margin, which I think the commentary was
very bullish. I think you said kind of exiting the year in the 3.20% to 3.30% range. Just to put a finer point on it, are
you assuming the forward curve, meaning, seven or eight, more rate hikes from here in that outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yes. We're assuming that, back to the Moody's consensus forecast, which we use to do our modeling, is that we
will have a 2.25% to 2.5% Fed funds rate at the end of the fourth quarter. And then as Will mentioned, that that
moves into 2023 whereby we would get to a 3%. That's what the Moody's forecast says today. And if that's true,
we would get another 15 to 20 basis points improvement from the fourth quarter in the full year 2023.

John, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that there's this kind of lingering concern out there in the market,
not necessarily on the Street about recession, but there's a lot of – there is some uncertainty. So how do you –
with that ACL ratio down to about 1.14% now and the size of the releases taken this past quarter, how do you feel
about provisioning and where that ACL migrates to going forward? Does it still have room to run down or should
we be just applying a reserve for loan growth going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Kevin. I share your frustration with the inability to predict that. And it's obviously a function of the CECL
model and the impact of changes and the economic forecasts on that. So maybe sort of unpack that just a little
bit. So, as I said in my comments for this quarter, we used a 50/50 weighting of two scenarios. The baseline
scenario, which is Moody's sort of middle of the road forecast where they assume there's a 50% chance of things
being better or worse than that.
And then we also weighted 50% their S3 scenario, which is their recessionary scenario. And that on the
probability curve is, in their lingo, is a 90% chance that things are better than that, than the S3, and a 10% chance
things are worse. And so at a 50/50 weighting of those two, essentially you're at 70% on that. If you pictured a
straight line, horizontal line between 0 being the happy days are here again and 100 being a terrible economic
event. We're at 70 by going to 50% of 90% and 50% of 50%. The – and we have used weightings between 50/50
and two-thirds based on one-third over the last number of quarters, so we've been in that effectively weighted
average range of 63% to 70% just to keep that mental image of the horizontal line as the example. If we had gone
100% baseline, so just to stick with [ph] whatever least things (30:05) can happen, and not wait in another
scenario with more pessimism, it would have told us to have a reserve of about 40 basis points below where we
are − where we were at the end of the quarter. And if we go with 100% S3, it would had us about 40 basis points
higher.
Now the thing that I'll caution you is that that changes quarter-by-quarter as those forecasts in the underlying
economic metrics and that are lost drivers in the CECL model change, so it could be that in a worse time, S3 is a
lot worse and baseline is a lot worse. So those are not static amount, so anyway that's sort of the underlying
thing. We – it could go lower if their forecasts continue to improve and they could also get worse.
And as we all know, with CECL if the projections are moved to predict worsening economic outlook quickly, then
you'll see a quick reaction through the provisions for credit loss to build that back up just based on the variability
that CECL imposes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And Kevin, look that's all the modeling and accounting stuff and that's a lot of detail there. The reality is as
we're going out in the marketplace, meeting with our customers and we're doing portfolio reviews of different
asset classes, we just − we don't see near-term issues at all.
We're looking at our line utilization rates. They're still very low, they're 5% to 10% below what they were in 2019,
telling us that our clients aren't having to lean heavily on their lines. They have got a lot of cash. We looked at our
loan-to-values of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is very conservative. I go back and I look at our five year
charge-off rate. It averages about 3 basis points.
So I do not share the market's concern about a near-term recession, the way the market reacted when the yield
curve inverted. There's a lot of macro monetary forces going on right now with that yield curve that are maybe not

normal market forces. So we're pretty bullish in the near term for the next year or so. Our clients are bullish and
we like the underwriting standards that we've got right now. And so we don't see near-term issues.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
That's very helpful. Thank you. One question, you earlier talked about expenses and with the obvious focus of
trying to help us blend together ACBI and Legacy South State. But can you talk a little bit about the environment
for hiring? I know just recently you guys put a release out about some hires made in some different markets in
your footprint.
There's also some large end market mergers going on. So it's not you guys doing an MOE anymore with
someone else. But just I'm curious with that potential for producers to be on-boarded, how you're – what kind of
opportunity that might represent for you? And is that included within that guidance for expenses? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Yeah, the opportunity is huge. Greg Lapointe is our Chief Banking Officer, but really he's our Chief Recruiting
Officer. He's out on the Street all the time meeting with bankers at other banks. We're not responding to bankers
that are looking to leave. We're reaching out and telling our story, talking about the South State culture and our
ability to recruit from the biggest banks is better than it's really ever been. And they're in these key markets and
they're bankers that have been at the same place sometimes their whole career with huge books of business.
And that we've just got a great fifth year when I come on board out of – at first at Wells Fargo, where we've got
the balance sheet scale, the treasury management products, the capital markets products that they can easily
bring their clients over. And they're having tremendous success. So we're real bullish on the opportunities to
recruit. And I'm just real proud of our team and what they're delivering. So from an expense standpoint we'll – if –
we're not going to let the budget restrict us from hiring if there's opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And we have assumed we will be – we will continue to have the success that we've had in that arena as we
think about our costs going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson Companies
Okay. Great. One last one from me. Just given the bullishness and the fact that this – all this asset sensitivity the
markets doesn't seem to be – you don't necessarily seem to be getting rewarded. You did buy back shares in the
quarter, should we expect that kind of pace or is there a certain price range where you're going to be more
aggressive in terms of stepping in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Kevin, we've always said that our first priority and first desire in investing capital is to invest in growth. And
anytime we can deploy capital into growth, we prefer to do that. We believe we've got a pretty good opportunity
ahead of us to continue to grow loans nicely and accelerate that growth a bit.

So it's likely that you'll see us pivot to investing capital in growth if that growth materializes. We've been very
active in capital returns over the last year. We've used up about $3.1 million of that $3.5 million share
authorization from January of 2021, and as I said about 370,000 shares remain. So, it depends upon – on the
opportunity set, but our preference is to invest it in growth.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question in the queue comes from Jennifer Demba of Truist
Securities. Your line is open.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey, this is Brandon King on for Jenny. Good morning.

Robert R. Hill Jr. A
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Hey, Brandon.

William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. So deposit growth on an organic basis was strong in the quarter. And I was just wondering what you're
seeing later this year as far as deposit growth and where we could potentially see the loan to deposit ratio by the
end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Brandon. This is Steve. We did see really good deposit growth in the first quarter. Some of that is seasonal
and typically what happens is the second and third quarter are a little down and then that comes back in the fourth
and first quarter. But, as – kind of how we're thinking about the fourth quarter this year and really all the way
through 2023 is to hold our deposit balances flat. And as we think about the interest rate discussion around betas,
we think that we probably could grow more in our markets. But we're trying to manage both margin and growth.
So I think what we've just articulated on the call was today we're at 68% loan to deposit ratio. And if we don't grow
deposits for the next call it 21 month through the end of 2023, by the end of 2023, with our forecast for loans
being in the high single-digit, we would see our loan to deposit ratio being about 80%. And with the way we would
really do that is we would take the excess cash that we have today, which is about – we have a $5.4 billion in

cash, call it about $4.5 billion of that is sort of excess, $4 billion to $4.5 billion. And that'll go to loan growth over
the next 21 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And as you can appreciate, Brandon, one of the hard things to predict with deposit growth is how the Fed reacts
with their own balance sheet. So we think it appropriate to conservatively assume we don't grow deposits at this
point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then in regards to Atlantic Capital, I know they had a pretty substantial growing fintech
payments business. And I wonder if there's been any sort of update there as far as how that could be expanded
further, any opportunities you're seeing in the market there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. This is John. Kurt Shreiner runs that business for us. And over the last few years, they've been growing
deposit balances and fee income at a compounded growth rate, about 40%. So in some respects, that growth in
the payments business, the fintech business, was sort of outstripping the Atlantic Capital balance sheet size.
So now as we've joined together, they can continue growing that business as they had in the past. So we just
looked for that continued growth rate, if they can keep doing that instead of a larger balance sheet, they're not
going to be constrained as they might have been before. So Kurt does a great job and we are excited to add
those verticals.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I apologize if you already made some comments on this, but I wanted to circle back on the loan production and I
just wanted to ask if the quarter-over-quarter decline and granted some of that is seasonality for sure. If that was
in any way due to the ACBI being folded in or is that purely market dynamics?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. That's not a result of the folded – Atlantic Capital kind of rolled in on March 1. So if you exclude the
acquired balances, that loan growth was 6.3%. Just a lot of growth coming out of Florida and Atlanta and we're
getting some good growth at Alabama as well. But it's kind of a nice mix of C&I, CRE, consumers growing again.
It was not last year, but consumers growing again and then residential. So it's kind of across the board. But that
growth rate excluded the acquired balances of Atlantic Capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
I guess, as I think about residential, we talked about it earlier but as we put more production on the balance sheet
and less in fee income, we're going to see less fee income moving forward. I think before we had guided our
secondary fee income to be or our non-interest income to assets to be between 75 and 85 basis points. We think
now with a little bit more of that mortgage production and some of the [indiscernible] (41:28) fees going away, so
that'll be between 70 basis points and 80 basis points from here on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. That's very helpful. And then I actually did want to circle back on mortgage a little bit and ask how, I
guess refi volumes are trending, and specifically if you could just give some color on since quarter end after April,
how has that looked?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. So we have a slide there on page 13 and you can see the production this quarter, it's $1.271 billion, of
which 70% was purchased, 30% was refinanced. So that refinance volume is going to trend down as the 30-year
mortgage rates are in the 5s.
So, we would expect the purchase volume to continue to remain strong. We're seeing a lot of activity – continued
activity, particularly in the construction-to-perm loans for our individual borrowers. We have a private wealth
group. There's a fair amount of construction loans that we do directly to high net worth individuals that have
relationships with us. So, I would say that the refinance volume is going to fall off, there's no doubt about it. But
we do think the purchase volume, at least for the short run is good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
And we've never been a refinanced focused shop. Obviously, we've gotten our share when refinance market is
big, but our focus is on purchase activity historically.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2022
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thank you for that color. And then just one last one on mortgage. Gain on sale margins are pretty
nicely stabilized for your teams at this level. And so could you give some commentary on the outlook from here
moving forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, I think gain on sale margins are coming in and particularly as you have this big movement in rates, you're
going to have -so I would just expect mortgage back to part of that guidance, the noninterest income to come
down 5 basis points, somewhere between 70 and 80 basis points in total. I'd envision that mortgage probably is
going to come down some more in the secondary side. As gain on sale margins are tightening, then we put more
production on the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
And just to step back to 10,000 or 20,000 feet, mortgage will not be a big part of the story in this kind of
environment. But our expectation with this yield curve is that the other cylinders in the engine, i.e., the net interest
margin, more than make up for that. And we're excited to have a yield curve back in our business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. If I can just sneak one more in quick on the fixed income revenue side of things. I guess, should we
expect some revenue pick up somewhat in tandem with how community banks are increasing bond purchases?
Or are those two not linked at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I think, our guidance has been $24 million to $28 million a quarter. And if you look at that graph for the last
several quarters, it's been somewhere between $25 million and $30 million. We don't think that any of that
changes, the nature of it might change between our ARC and our fixed income, and our correspondent division.
But in reality, the banks had an AOCI hit like everybody did, and they're a little bit shell shocked right now. But
they'll come back in when this thing settles down. And to your point, over time, fixed income will get better, if we
have a steep yield curve. But in the short run, we think our ARC revenues will be a little bit better than fixed
income, but the total pie will be similar to what we've had.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.
