Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
Thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon. Welcome to Heartland's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
We appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance for the second quarter of
2020.
For the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the call over to Heartland's
President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance and our COVID response; and then Bryan
McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around Heartland's results.
Well, during these very challenging times, our priority has been the safety of our employees, the ongoing support
of our customers, our shareholders and communities. Since 1981, Heartland's 39 years of consistent profitability
and growth has been grounded in a culture of taking extremely good care of all of our constituents. We continue
to differentiate ourselves through our strong capital, liquidity, credit and financial performance metrics. Bruce Lee
and Bryan McKeag will provide more detail on the many things we're doing to support, protect and care for our
employees, customers, shareholders and communities.
So, now on to the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2020, I'm pleased to report that we had a very
good second quarter.Net income available to common shareholders was $30.1 million compared to $20 million for
the linked quarter, earnings per diluted common share was $0.82 compared to $0.54 for the linked quarter, and
return on average tangible common equity was 11.97% compared to 8% for the linked quarter. Our second
quarter results were very strong on a tax-effected pre-provision, acquisition, integration and restructuring cost
basis, outperforming the four prior quarters. Now using the same calculation, we achieved the following results.
Adjusted net income available to common shareholders this quarter was $51.8 million compared to $49.8 million
for Q2 2019, which included $18 million in gain on sale of our mortgage servicing portfolio at the Dubuque Bank
and Trust and the gains from several branch sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $1.40
compared to $1.39 for Q2 2019 and adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 20.02% compared
to 21.41% for the same quarter in 2019.
Well, assets crossed the $15 billion mark at the end of the second quarter, and this achievement is a tremendous
milestone for our company and a testament to the hard work and success of our employees in growing our
company, both organically and through acquisitions. The net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was
strong at 3.85%, and our efficiency ratio showed substantial improvement at 55.75%. Bruce and Bryan will share
more detail in their comments.
Book value and tangible book value this quarter were at $44.42 and $31.14, respectively, an increase over Q2
2019 of 7% and 10%, respectively. The tangible common equity ratio declined 40 basis points to 7.89% at quarter
end from 8.29% last quarter. The decline was driven by the significant growth in our balance sheet, which
included the addition of $1.1 billion in net payroll protection program loans. Now that said, our TCE would be
approximately 8.5% excluding the income and balances of the PPP loans booked in the quarter.
On the M&A front, in June, we announced that our Arizona Bank & Trust franchise in Phoenix had entered into a
purchase and assumption agreement to acquire certain assets and assume substantially all of the deposits and
other liabilities of Johnson Bank's Arizona operations. Johnson Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson
Financial Group located in Racine, Wisconsin. Currently, eight of Heartland's member banks have assets
exceeding $1 billion. When the branch transaction is completed in December of this year, Arizona Bank & Trust
will become Heartland's ninth bank subsidiary to cross $1 billion in assets, with approximately $1.1 billion in
assets and 10 banking centers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
With respect to the AimBank transaction in West Texas, we will be closing in the third quarter of this year.
AimBank, a $1.8 billion asset bank, when merged with and into Heartland's Lubbock, Texas-based subsidiary
FirstBank and Trust, will be Heartland's largest independent bank charter with approximately $3 billion in assets.
This will be the fifth largest bank headquartered in West Texas and the third largest deposit market share bank in
Lubbock.
Now, on closing, I'm pleased to report that last week Heartland's board of directors approved a $0.20 per share
common dividend payable August 29, 2020 to shareholders of record on August 7, 2020. The board also
approved a preferred dividend of $211.94 payable on October 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on September
30, 2020.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President and CEO, who will provide an overview on the
company's operating performance, COVID-19 response, and credit. Bruce?

Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon. As our country continues to navigate the coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to
take a moment to recognize our employees and say how proud I am of their commitment to each other, our
customers and our communities. Heartland's strong results reflect their passion and dedication.
During the second quarter, we delivered $155 million pre-provision revenue, an increase of 12% over the linked
quarter. Core margin also improved to 3.79%, up slightly from the linked quarter, and we delivered our lowest
ever efficiency ratio of 55.75% for the quarter. Year-to-date, our efficiency ratio is 58.64%. These outstanding
results demonstrate our focus on our core business and customers. Our discipline in holding the line on costs and
our ability to operate in a low interest rate environment, all while responding to the extraordinary operating
circumstances and expenses associated with COVID-19.
The pandemic situation continues to evolve and our team has been dynamic, anticipating challenges and pivoting
when necessary. But one constant has been Heartland's unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our
employees. We continue to operate under our pandemic management plan, protecting employees while enabling
business continuity and providing relief and support to customers and communities that are facing challenges
from the impacts of COVID-19. Employees who can work from home continue to do so, while those who come
into bank locations are on rotating teams to limit potential exposure. All in-person events and large meetings have
been held virtually or canceled. Our expanded time off program and enhanced healthcare coverage for COVID-19
related testing and treatments are in place. And certain customer-facing employees are receiving a 20% wage
premium.
Heartland's diverse geographic footprint has been a strength during the pandemic. After closing most of our bank
lobbies in March and April, we reopened gradually on a state-by-state basis, shared key learnings on operations
and safety. We were cautiously optimistic about expanding our in-person services in May and June. Recent
outbreaks in some states have led us to pull back and close bank lobbies again in certain locations to protect the
health and safety of our employees and customers. We recognize this will likely continue to occur across our
footprint and our country. We are prepared and confident in our ability to operate in this environment for the
foreseeable future and continue to deliver the high level of service our customers and communities expect from
us.
We're living our mission of enriching lives one customer, employee and community at a time. We're putting people
first, and our employees and customers have noticed. Our recent employee engagement survey generated the

highest scores we've ever received. We're earning goodwill with our employees and customers through our relief
programs and contributions we've made in our communities. In April, we donated $1.2 million to organizations that
are working directly with those affected by COVID-19.
Despite many headwinds, Heartland continues to grow. And in the second quarter, our total assets surpassed $15
billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the linked quarter. This was driven by deposit growth, our support of the
Paycheck Protection Program and the successful completion of our $115 million preferred stock offering.
Turning to deposits, during the second quarter, non-time deposits increased 15.7% or $1.6 billion. This significant
increase was comprised of $142 million of consumer deposits and $1.4 billion of commercial deposits. 9 of our 11
banks saw double-digit percentage growth from the linked quarter. Minnesota Bank & Trust increased non-time
deposits by 29% and Premier Valley Bank increased non-time deposits by 25%.
Branch transactions have decreased 27% since the end of the second quarter in 2019. This was accelerated by
branch lobby closures during the pandemic, but also highlights the consumer behavior shift to digital. While in
branch service and cash transactions are declining, digital usage is increasing.
We were prepared to respond when the Fed cut interest rates. In the second quarter, the average rate paid on
interest-bearing deposits was 32 basis points, down 47 basis points from the linked quarter. Our deposit pricing
strategies along with our previously implemented interest rate floors on commercial loans enabled us to increase
core interest margin by 4 basis points.
Last month, The Nielsen Report announced that Heartland's commercial credit card program was ranked among
the top 35 purchasing card programs for growth in 2019, a result of our commitment to providing best-in-class
technology and personalized service for our customers.
Turning to loans, our total commercial lending portfolio increased by $979 million, which includes $1.1 billion in
PPP loans. More specifically, the commercial and business loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans, declined by $184
million while commercial real estate lending grew $38 million. The primary driver of the decline in commercial
lending balances was lower utilization of revolving credit lines, which decreased to 33% from 42%, resulting in a
decline of $234 million in loan balances during the quarter. If line utilization would have been maintained at
historical levels, commercial loan growth would have been approximately $88 million for the quarter. We
continued to see run off in our remaining portfolios as the agricultural portfolio declined $29 million and residential
and consumer loans decreased by a total of $77 million from the linked quarter.
Next, I'll provide an overview of our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program. Heartland is proud to have
helped thousands of small businesses obtain PPP loans. In total, we processed more than 4,800 PPP loans for
$1.2 billion and help preserve more than 112,000 jobs.
Turning to credit, we continue to see stable credit quality. Our non-performing loans represented 1% of total loans
at the end of the second quarter, which is a small increase when compared to 95 basis points at the end of the
linked quarter. Overall, non-performing assets as a percent of total assets increased slightly to 66 basis points in
the second quarter compared to 64% – 64 basis points in the linked quarter. Excluding PPP, non-performing
assets were 71 basis points.
Other real estate decreased to $5.5 million from $6 million over the same period. Excluding PPP, the delinquency
ratio decreased to 26 basis points from 38 basis points in the linked quarter.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
Non-pass rated loans increased to 8.5% from 6.4% in the linked quarter, excluding PPP. The ratio remains at
historically low levels. However, we are starting to see a shift in the risk ratings due to the pandemic. Lastly, net
charge-offs for the second quarter were reported at $2.4 million, or 12 basis points, excluding PPP. That's lower
than the previous quarter number of $5 million, or 24 basis points.
We've made loan modifications on $1.1 billion of loans in our portfolio. 58% of these are interest-only for 90 days
and the remainder are primarily principal and interest deferments for 90 days. Through closed collaboration and
consultation with our customers, as of July 23, we have returned $348 million to their original payment structure.
We're taking proactive steps to prepare for the future and help our customers stabilize their positions.
Based on regular conversations with customers, we expect that 70% of the remaining loan modifications will end
in the third quarter. We anticipate less than 30% of the balances will require additional support through further
modifications. We've posted a presentation on our Investor Relations website that provides further details on loan
modifications and exposure in COVID-impacted industries.
The allowance for credit losses on loans increased $22.6 million, $11.6 million of which relates to sand fracking
company that operates in an industry that's been negatively impacted by the pandemic. We do not have any
additional exposure in the fracking industry.
We've recognized that communication, collaboration and counsel with our customers is more important than ever
in these challenging times. We've tripled the resources in our special assets group to help them navigate a path
forward. We've also added experienced leadership and recently announced that Nathan Jones, who's joined
Heartland, as our new Chief Credit Officer. Nathan brings 20 years of proven experience in managing large scale
credit and banking operations.
As Lynn mentioned earlier, we continue to seek strategic M&A opportunities that are good geographic and cultural
fits in growth markets. In June, we announced that Arizona Bank & Trust entered into a purchase agreement with
Johnson Bank for four banking centers in the Phoenix market. Upon the targeted close in December, Arizona
Bank & Trust will have approximately $1.1 billion in assets and be Heartland's ninth bank with more than $1 billion
in asset. The AIM acquisition is targeted to close in the third quarter and complete the system integration in the
fourth quarter. AimBank combined with First Bank will create Heartland's largest bank with approximately $3
billion in assets.
The investments we made in Operation Customer Compass in 2019 allowed us to quickly shift operations to meet
changing customer needs. We've recently completed the implementation of our new commercial online banking
platform and now have half of our banks using our new loan origination platform and the Salesforce CRM
solution. Based upon our proven success of implementing best-in-class technology, streamlining processes,
increasing capacity and improving operations to provide enhanced customer experiences, all while achieving at
an all-time low efficiency ratio, we continue to make strategic investments in Operation Customer Compass.
In 2020, we will upgrade our entire ATM network, which we expect to finish early this fall, modernize and
consolidate our Lockbox operations, implement enhanced authentication measures across our digital channels to
protect our customers from fraud and implement video banking solutions and other digital-first programs that allow
our bankers to meet with and service our customers virtually and build convenient, temporary customer
experiences.
I now will turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Heartland's Chief Financial Officer for more details on the financials.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing the press release, which shows reported
earnings per share of $0.82 this quarter. This includes provisions for credit losses of $26.8 million and acquisition
integration cost of $700,000. Excluding these items, Heartland's after-tax pre-provision, and acquisition and
integration cost earnings per share was $1.40. For the quarter, one additional significant item of note was a $1.2
billion of PPP loans originated during the quarter, which produced $6 million of interest and fee income and added
$0.13 to earnings per share. So, again this quarter, core results were solid with financial trends and metrics also
positive in almost all aspects.
As I mentioned, the total provision for credit losses this quarter was $26.8 million with approximately $6 million of
the provision attributed to the continued deterioration in the economic forecasts since the prior quarter. Provisions
to increase reserves on individually assessed impaired loans totaled $12 million, largely related to one fracking
sand credit, as Bruce mentioned. The remaining provision of $9 million is attributed to loan downgrades and
balance changes within the portfolios.
In total, the quarterly provision net of $2.4 million in net charge-offs resulted in a reserve bill during the quarter of
just over $24 million, which represents a 22% increase from the prior quarter reserves. At quarter end, the
allowance for credit losses on loans was $119.9 million, or 1.3% of the total loans. And the allowance for credit
losses and unfunded loan commitments was $17.4 million, or 19 basis points of total loans. Together, these two
allowances result in a total allowance for lending-related credit losses of $137.3 million or 1.49% of total loss.
When the PPP loan balances are excluded, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses increases 20
basis points to 1.69% of loans. We used the June 14 consensus macroeconomic baseline forecast from Moody's
as our most likely economic scenario. As the economy outlook continues to evolve and our pandemic-related
loss, profiles and experience develops, we will adjust our allowance for lending, losses and provisioning
accordingly.
Moving on to the rest of the balance sheet, total assets grew $1.7 billion, ending the quarter just over $15 billion
with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 73%. Tangible common equity ratio declined 40 basis points to 7.89% from 8.29%
last quarter, as increases from retained earnings and the fair value marks on the bond portfolio were more than
offset by the impact of a $1.7 billion increase in assets. That increase in assets was driven by the addition of $1.1
billion in net PPP loans and a $600 million increase in the bond portfolio. Excluding the impact of the PPP loans,
the ratio would have increased 62 basis points to 8.51%.
In addition, on June 26, we issued $115 million of preferred stock, which will ensure that our capital – regulatory
capital ratios will remain strong after the closing of the AIM transaction that will trigger the Collins amendment to
the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, resulting in $145 million of trust losing to Tier 1 capital treatment.
Investments also grew $637 million this quarter and comprised 28% of assets with a tax equivalent yield of
2.91%, a duration of just under six years and generate $37 million of average monthly cash flow. Total borrowings
remain low at $395 million or 2.6% of assets. At June 30, our banking network had approximately $4.7 billion of
unused borrowing capacity.
So Heartland's balance sheet is very strong with solid capital base, healthy loss reserves, ample liquidity and low
leverage, all of which puts Heartland in great position to successfully navigate through the turbulent economic
times ahead.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $124.1 million in this quarter or $11.6 million higher
than the prior quarter, and includes the $6 million of interest and fee income on PPP loans. The net interest
margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.85% or 1 basis point higher than last quarter and includes a
decline of 43 basis points in loan yield, which is largely due to the low yield on the PPP loans. The lower loan
yields were offset by much lower interest costs on deposits and borrowings, which decreased 48 basis points
compared to last quarter.
The PPP loan interest income and fee income of $6 million on average balances of $916 million results in a yield
of 2.64%, which lowered this quarter's net interest margin by 10 basis points. This quarter the net interest margin
includes 16 basis points of purchase accounting accretion compared to 9 basis points in the prior quarter. So as a
result the margin excluding purchase accounting and PPP loans was 3.79% which is 4 basis points higher than
last quarter.
Non-interest income totaled $30.6 million for the quarter, up $4.8 million from last quarter, as the gain-on-sales
loans was up $3.2 million on higher mortgage loan activity and total security gains increased $1.3 million
compared to last quarter.
Moving to non-interest expense, non-interest expense has continued to be well-managed totaling $90.4 million
this quarter, down $400,000 compared to last quarter. On a core run rate basis, which excludes acquisition,
integration and restructuring costs, tax credit costs, and asset gains and losses, core run rate decreased $1
million to $88.3 million compared to $89.3 million last quarter. More specifically, salary and benefits were flat at
approximately $50 million again this quarter and occupancy, furniture and equipment costs totaling $90.5 million
also remained flat this quarter. These categories account for two-thirds of our core costs and have been at this
level for the past nine quarters.
In addition, FTEs of 1,821 also remained flat this quarter and over the last nine quarters have declined by 395 or
18% from a peak of 2,216 FTEs in the second quarter of 2018. During that same period, assets have increased
$3.7 billion, or 33%. These results demonstrate the leverage and increase productivity we have achieved as we
worked to restructure the company, trimmed our branch network and implemented the many Customer Compass
productivity improvements we identified over the past two years, all while continuing the company's significant
growth.
As a result, the efficiency ratio, as Lynn and Bruce mentioned, improved significantly this quarter, coming in at
55.75% for the quarter, which is an over 600 basis points improvement from last quarter and over 800 basis
points better in the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.75% compared to 22.77%
last quarter with the decline being primarily due to higher tax credits recognized this quarter.
Now with regard to upcoming M&A activities, the AimBank acquisition, which is due to close in Q3, will have the
following impacts. First, loans held to maturity will increase about $1.1 billion net of an estimated loan mark in a
3% to 3.5% range and investment should increase about $400 million.
Total deposits will increase nearly $1.6 billion with approximately $500 million in non-interest bearing accounts.
AIM carries a net interest margin of 4% – in the 4% range has non – has core non-interest income run rate of
approximately $2 million per quarter net of Durbin and an non-interest expense run rate before cost saves of $11
million to $12 million per quarter. Second, at closing we will issue approximately 1.5 million shares of Heartland
common stock. We are currently estimating goodwill of $60 million to $70 million and the core deposit intangible
of $10 million to $15 million. These estimates could change once all the fair value marks are finalized and will
primarily depend on Heartland's stock price at the closing date.

Third, we expect integration and conversion costs will be near $3.5 million spread over the next two quarters. And
with the system conversion currently planned for mid-fourth quarter, we will not begin to realize the full benefit of
the estimated 30% cost saves until the first quarter of 2021.
Finally, with regards to the acquisition of the four Johnson Bank branches in Arizona, which is expected to close
and convert to our systems in early December, we are currently estimating that loans will increase by $150 million
to $170 million and deposits will increase by $350 million to $400 million with 35% to 40% being in non-interest-
bearing accounts. We are currently estimating goodwill of $30 million to $35 million and deposit intangibles of $3
million to $5 million.
Non-interest income run rate is expected to be $300,000 to $400,000 per month and non-interest expense run
rates are $500 million to $600 million per month. The integration and conversion costs will be between $1 million
and $1.5 million and should be largely booked in the fourth quarter of 2020.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would say, for you guys, I would probably not put much in for AIM this quarter. It might – we might get a month,
we might get a half a month, we'll see. So I think you're really looking at a fourth quarter from a financial impact to
your model. Does that helps?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Sure. That does. And then I think you've rattled through the – I missed the Arizona branch contribution on non-
interest income and non-interest expense, that was on a monthly basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I did that on a monthly basis since we're closing in early December. So if you want to [ph] pick up
(00:35:51) a month and that was for non-interest income $300,000 to $400,000 per month and non-interest
expense is $500,000 to $600,000 per month.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Great. Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to maybe circle back on the – what was the cost of funds and really the
decline in that level pretty impressive. I guess, was there anything other kind of one-time in there or was it just
sort of continued decline in borrowings and good success on lowering other core deposits, if you could just speak
to that, because I think that was a pretty big effort in quarter?

Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, I would say that we were prepared. We had – our banks were ready for the Fed cuts. So we acted
very quickly. And we basically, after the second cut, went to zero. Really, the only thing that we're paying

So there was nothing one-time in there at all. It was just quick action and preparation by our banks when the Fed
cuts occurred and we did get the benefit of the loans hitting floors that also helped, which we've been talking
about that for over a year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. And then I guess just the outlook on margin that I – ex the – [ph] ex (00:37:32) AIM, AIM I think is on a core
basis a little higher and you've got some flexibility there. But just on a core basis, what do you think you had from
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think on the core, we should be able to keep it somewhere where it are – where it is to maybe down to
3.75%, so you might see 4 or 5 basis points. I mean, things are going to grind down as we go forward as loans
continue to reprice and the bond portfolio, as that cash flow has to get reinvested, is going to grind it down
somewhat. So I think next quarter if we saw 3.75% core and then you have PPP and you have purchase
accounting might be – come back to 3.80% or so for a reported NIM. And then AIM might help a little bit in the
quarter, but it will help in the fourth quarter for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I haven't [ph] funded (00:38:25) that all together. It might help a tick or two given its relative size.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And I guess triggered one last question, just the timing on the PPE, what – I guess what are you modeling
for I guess forgiveness or what do you think you carry in the balance at the end of the year, any internal
projections?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. It's really hard to project. I think our thoughts are and Bruce, you can jump in here, we probably see 90% to
95% should be forgiven. And I think that's going to be a fourth – largely a fourth quarter, maybe some into the first
quarter of 2021 event. We might get a few in the third quarter, but I think it's going to be largely fourth quarter and
then some into the first quarter before we get them all done. So I think that's the most we know right now.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe if you could just talk about some regional differences across your franchise, specific to the COVID-19
portfolio? Bruce, in your prepared remarks, you talked about kind of an opening and then a closing in certain
markets and I was just wondering from a high level if you had noticed any regional differences?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Terry. I would say, in the loan portfolio, we're really not seeing much of a regional
difference at all, but certainly from consumer behaviors and our opening and kind of closing, we definitely saw
that. We saw it in Texas where we're currently operating with no lobbies open and we saw it in Arizona, where we
also closed all of our lobbies there. We also closed some lobbies in Colorado, although they're still operating with,
I believe, 10 of our branches there, the lobbies are also open. But we really haven't seen it on the loan side. We
really are seeing it more on the transaction in which branches are open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then as a follow-up, the reserve ratio increased again in the second quarter. The commentary
right from the press release said, expect higher charge-offs and higher non-performing loans. So, I guess with
that backdrop – with that assumption, does that suggest additional reserve build in the third and fourth quarter, or
was that captured here in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, it's again hard to gauge, but I think our reserve build is going to slow down and we're probably
going to see charge-offs pick up a bit and so use up some of that reserve. I could see us covering charge-offs
maybe a little bit more in provisions. But hopefully, it really depends on what the economy is going to do if that
lengthens out and we have a continuing lag of poor economic results. Obviously, the reserve won't be able to
come down, and we'll have to maintain it even if we have charge-offs. So – but I don't think you're going to see
the size of builds that we had the first two quarters, certainly maybe a little bit in the third quarter. But after that if
things go the way they should, we should see flat to starting to use some of the reserve against losses that
actually come that we expected as we built the reserve.

Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Questions – hi. On the mortgage side, the gain-on-sale, was this driven by improvements in the gain-on-sale
premium or was it volume? What was the driver behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think it was probably a little bit of both. We did have great volumes and because the great volumes, we
were probably able to push our margins a little more, and so I think we did get both. So I mean, the guys at
PrimeWest really did a great job this quarter getting to that number. We're hoping they can keep that rolling. And
we'll see if the economy – if the housing market is as strong as it appears like everybody says, it's going to be –
we hope that it'll continue for another quarter and then you'll get the seasonal drop-off I think like we would
normally get.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. They're seeing there. Their rate locks continue to be very strong and their margins, they've been able to
really increase margins. So – but we feel that they're going to have another pretty strong quarter here in the third
quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

No. No. No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then, if you just look at the deferrals and what your borrowers are telling you and it sounds like a small
portion of them will remain on deferral or maybe need for more deferral period. But at what point do you think that
that's when you start to see charge-offs, right, or [ph] criticized bonds (00:44:14) increases. Is that going to be
later this year? And really, what would – what would trigger you guys are started making large – more
downgrades in these loan types?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We're making downgrades as some of the borrowers are asking for additional support. So even if we make
an additional 90-day modification, you'll probably start to see downgrades. But when they would move into either
charge-offs or nonaccruals, it would probably be after that next 90 days. So we really think that it's related a little
bit to the reserve build on the question that Terry asked. It probably will depend a lot on what happens to those
modifications and whether it's the 30% that we anticipate or whether it's better than that as to how that reserve
build occurs.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got you, okay. So I see you've provided $11.6 million towards the $14.5 million. So pretty healthy reserve there.
Do you expect a favorable resolution on this or you guys kind of thinking that it's probably going to be charged off
next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think in the next two quarters it will resolve probably.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, it happened very, very quickly. At the end of last quarter, the loan was current and the market turned
quickly and we are in negotiation, but are prepared to begin liquidating, if necessary. So that's why we took the
significant reserve and I think it will definitely resolve itself before the end of the year. I would hate to say exactly
which quarter.
[indiscernible] (00:47:05)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A

Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, all right. And then securities went up by a decent amount this quarter. Can you just give a little perspective
on the thought process there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, we just have so much liquidity, Damon, with the deposits growing the way they did and we grew –
the PPP money came in, moved over to deposits primarily and then, we grew an additional $400 million,$500
million past that and we were liquid already. So, yeah, Zac had a lot of money to put to work as Treasurer of the
company. And so, we're trying to get that, yet still stay liquid because money could flow the other way fairly
quickly depending upon how the economy goes. So it really was that, we just had a really great deposit quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And Damon, couple of other things that we're thinking about through this process is corporations,
companies, businesses shrank their balance sheets, generated cash, paid down lines and then, there's a whole

bunch of cash on our balance sheet. We don't know what all the burn rates are there, plus if PPP starts to get
forgiven, we're going to get all that cash back. So, we're trying to be very conservative in our estimates right now,
more liquid than we would normally be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got you. Okay. And then I guess just lastly on expenses, Bryan, obviously you have couple of moving parts with
the AIM deal closing and then later on with the Arizona. But what are you thinking about the core expense run
rate kind of going forward from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. If I were to say, I think our core is at $88 million today. I think that's going to be close to that, might get a
little bit with AIM, maybe one month at most. So, you might get $2 million, $3 million added to that if they come in
October or September, sorry. Then the next quarter, I still think the core of Heartland is going to stay relatively flat
at that $88 million, but then you're going to add another $12 million probably on for AIM. So you could be at $100
million of core there and then maybe one month of $0.5 million or so with the addition of Johnson branch. So you
could be $100 million to $101 million. So I think we can do maybe better than that, but that's what I would say is
pretty reasonable right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Don't forget the cost saves.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2020
Hey, just looking at your affected – industries affected by the COVID-19 and I see lodging at little over 4% of
loans, restaurant bars, industries that may be impacted for an extended period of time. So my question is when
you're talking about the deferrals and you've got 90 day deferrals out there, you've got another 90 day going, how
do you foresee things playing out after you get to 180 days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, the first thing is we have to get through the first 90 days, which we are not all the way through all of these
borrowers because many of them are just coming off here and they'll come off in July and August for their first 90
days and it really depends, I mean, they're all responding very differently. And that's honestly, it's a little bit of the
unknown that we're going through this and lodging, it depends the type of facility it is and where it's located and if
it's in any sort of a recreational area, we're seeing occupancies above breakeven; if it's in a kind of a downtown
center that was more business travel, I mean, they're still struggling. So, everyone is a little different. And it also
depends on the sponsor and the liquidity that they have. So, I'm not really sure I can give you, as a group,
guidance there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I mean, I do think, David, what we said in our comments is we would see maybe a third left having to get kind of
re-opt for another 90 days. And then when you get to the end of that second 90 days, we have to make – if
anybody still needs modifications, that's going to be a fairly hard discussion because I think then we'll be in the
troubled debt restructuring territory and a lot of other things. So I think you're going to see a dwindling number
now if the economy doesn't get better and support doesn't work or whatever, then you've got a whole different
ballgame but kind of what we think will happen now based on the economic forecasts showing an improvement as
we kind of move out of last half of the year, that's kind of our general thought right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. As a follow-up, have you had discussions with your regulators at this point about how you'd be treating
those from an accounting perspective after the 180 days, assuming – just thinking worst case scenario and you
had some of that had to go past that, if you had discussions on how that would be accounted for, is that still to be
determined?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We haven't talked to the regulators. I know when we've talked to our accountants, KPMG, we kind of think when
we get past 180 days, we're going to have to do an assessment for TDRs from a...

...GAAP perspective. Now whether the regulators will give us any different treatment from regulatory, I haven't
heard anything different. But I think for accounting purposes, after 180 days, we're going to have to – anything
that's still being modified is going to have to go through a TDR review.

processing $1.2 billion in PPP loans. We showed substantial growth of $1.6 billion in non-time deposits, while at
the same time doing a great job maintaining our net interest margin at 3.85%. We were very pleased with our
lowest ever efficiency ratio at 55.75% for the quarter and 58.64% year-to-date. Our balance sheet is extremely
liquid, and credit issues remain relatively benign. We issued $115 million of perpetual preferred to bolster our Tier
1 capital with all other capital ratios remaining strong and under CECL, we continue to significantly build our
reserves for loan losses, but at the same time, on a tax-effected pre-provision, acquisition, integration and
restructuring cost basis, most of our financial performance metrics are as good or better than the same quarter
last year. And last, we're very excited to welcome our new merger partners, AimBank of West Texas in the third
quarter and the four Johnson Bank branches in Phoenix, Arizona in early December.
So, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and hope you can all join us again for our next quarterly
conference call in late October 2020. Have a great evening, everyone.
