Thank you, Paul, and thank all of you for joining us here this morning. Most of you have been during these calls.
And so, we're going to begin every one of these calls with the shareholder value dashboard. These metrics are
really our North Star. There are a lot of interesting things that can be talked about. Obviously, Harold will talk
about more things in more detail here in just a few minutes. But ultimately, we're here to produce shareholder
value and this is how we think you do it overtime, looking at the GAAP measure first and then the adjusted
numbers, which really better reflect how we run the business.
At a glance, you can see that we continue to grow revenue more rapidly and reliably than peers, and we continue
to grow our balance sheet volumes more rapidly and reliably with payers, which is the view of our future revenue
growth. And then, we relentlessly focus on compounding tangible book value. And then, across the bottom, now,
the key asset quality metrics we focus on, reflected both fraud loan formation and losses.
In general, those metrics continue to be among the best in the peer group and as you can see, compare favorably
to our longer-term historical averages. But that said, during the quarter, we increased our allowance for credit

losses on loans from 1.08% to 1.12%, primarily as a result of a further deterioration in a previously disclosed
problem borrower and to provide additional protection given a higher, broader rate scenario.
So, from 30,000 feet this quarter, we've got the reserve build on one side largely being offset by the recognition of
a commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower expenses in the form of reduction in associate incentives.
Nevertheless, for me, there's a lot to celebrate here, particularly in terms of revenue growth, with growth in both
noninterest income and net interest income, double-digit core deposit growth and even net growth in noninterest-
bearing deposits.
So, with that, Harold, let's take a more in-depth look at the quarter.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. Another strong quarter of deposit growth. We were also pleased with
how our noninterest-bearing deposits performed in the quarter, giving us additional optimism about where those
balances likely end for the year.
As to 2024 deposit growth, still believe we can grow deposits than the previous range of high-single to low-
double-digits this year. Obviously, the latest FOMC meeting will impact our rate projections for the remainder of
the year. As a result, we've taken more time looking at the back book on deposits. Two years ago, 100% of our
NMAs had rates less than 2%. Today, only 15% of our rate is less than 2%.
Also today, 65% of our money markets are at rates greater than 4%. So, we feel that our deposits are priced very
competitively. We have made some preemptive strikes here late in the quarter, successfully reducing some of our
more expensive accounts, as well as a deep dive on our pool of reciprocal deposits. This effort is helpful to our
outlook as we enter the second quarter.
After new accounts added to our lenders in the first quarter, the average onboarding rate was around 3.75%. As
we've said, we like our position as to deposit rates in our markets. So, for us, deposit rates will likely be more like
a slow creep from here, not any sort of rapid increase. I've listened to a few conference calls of late, particularly
the large cap, so, some believe they've acknowledged outsized deposit spread and are letting people know that
benefit may be going away in the near future.
That said, we believe as we head into the second quarter, deposit rates for us may increase a few basis points,
but it won't be a lot. Loan payments slightly less than we anticipated. We did have some large payoffs late in the
quarter, which impacted our EOP balances. Still feel like we will be outside of loan growers for the year, call it 9%
to 11% growth.
Still believe that we are doing a good job on spreads, particularly for prime and SOFR price credit and fixed rate
spreads continue to come along nicely. One of the keys to our financial plan is repricing our fixed rate loans.
We're expecting about $3 billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan book, which are scheduled to come in over
the remainder of 2024 with, call it, an average yield around 4.65%.
As to renewals and new fixed rate loans originated in the first quarter, we averaged around 7.35% with a target of
7.5% to 8%. I think our RMs are doing a great job here and are looking forward to seeing what happens in the
second quarter, as it is the most important quarter as far as net interest income growth for 2024 is concerned,
given we have a lot of opportunity to influence the success of this initiative in the second quarter. Our loan growth

targets which we feel good about, coupled with our efforts on fixed rate repricing, will go a long way to hitting our
net interest income outlook for the year.
We did see some contraction in the margin this quarter at 3.04% after two quarters of 3.06%. We said last time
that we were optimistic that we would see NIM expansion in 2024. We feel confident that we will see margin
expansion happen in the second quarter. We modified our interest rate forecast from 4 times to 2 times, and with
the two not happening until later in the year, one in September and one in November. That said, given the
volatility of the data, we could decide that no rate cuts will happen this year, as the trends seem to point to fewer
at this point.
We feel like the no rate cut scenario on the short end of the curve is likely neutral to our current outlook as we
move through the year. As you might expect, we just would like to see the intermediate part of the curve continue
to steepen. So, at March 31, you might ask, is PNFP asset-sensitive or liability-sensitive. Considering our tactical
balance sheet modeling, as well as how we think our RMs and their clients typically respond to these sort of
environments, where net interest income initially higher-for-longer is probably helpful, but longer-term deposit
rates will likely lull somewhat and potentially squeeze the margin over time.
As for credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. We mentioned one non-performing credit in the
fourth quarter press release that weakened further during the first quarter. As we noted above, this credit
contributed to the 4 basis point increase in our allowance this quarter. This loan started out in 2020 as a $40
million loan to borrower that leases highly specialized healthcare facilities to operators in various states.
We did record a partial charge off of $2 million relating to this credit in the first quarter. The operators of the
borrowers buildings were impacted by COVID, as operators were unable to collect sufficient and timely
reimbursement, which was mainly to recover the incremental cost of inflation for their clients and patients. As a
result, the operators incurred revenue shortfalls, skilled labor lab census went down, et cetera.
Our borrower is cooperative that is helping facilitate resolution, which could take a few quarters. This is one where
the lesson learned is a hard film as well. Much reliance on the wisdom of the management team that we have
made for many years, the management team had executed a similar business model before and done it
successfully and was experienced in the very specific corners of the healthcare industry.
We will work to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and minimize loss to our firm. The buildings are in good
markets or and are in attractive areas in those markets. So, given all the above, we're anticipating a net charge-off
rate of 20 basis points to 25 basis points for 2024, inclusive of the loan I mentioned previously. Currently, we have
no reason to believe that our allowance of capital increase from here, so we are flattish on the reserve for the rest
of 2024.
More about commercial real estate and just so you know, we've added some more information on the credit
primarily for CRE and construction in the supplemental deck. Our CRE construction portfolio continues to perform
very well. As you might expect, our credit officers continue to pay particular attention to our multifamily, hospitality
and office portfolios. We continue to push for lower exposure in construction. Our target of 70% of total risk-based
capital, we believe can be achieved before year-end 2024.
Our appetite is noted by the almost solid red table on the bottom right is largely unchanged and we don't
anticipate any change as to appetite in 2024, even when we go below 70%. We continue to be somewhat
interested in the high quality real estate, primarily warehouse and some multi-family, but let me stress, any new
5

commitments to this space are limited to strategic client relationships only, and no way should anyone perceive
we're on any sort of offense here.
As to the impact of higher-for-longer, lots of discussion around liquidity and take-out availability in the institutional
CRE space. We would agree that liquidity is tight for, say, downtown multi-tenant office, power center retail, high-
end hospitality and other specific segments, where COVID and now inflation has been very impactful. We just
don't have much, if any, exposure to these segments.
For our segments, we, like other banks, are seeing our institutional borrowers delay decisioning regarding any
sort of exit from these projects, whether it be marketing for sale or securing a permanent loan. I know there's a lot
of noise out there that lenders are panicked and borrowers are desperate to get out of these construction projects,
not so for the property type PNFP has long supported. There remains ample liquidity, which recently appears to
be getting somewhat more attractive to our borrowers, specifically take out from life insurance companies and the
agency lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These capital sources are generally more favorably priced than
our bank debt, usually by 1% to 2% in most cases. We're seeing 10-year terms from insurance firms and
agencies in the 7% range versus bank rates, call it, between 8% and 8.5%.
The CMBS market is also available. However, our borrowers are typically not big fans given the inherent
inflexibility of the CMBS debt structure.3 3 All in for now, many borrowers are likely to remain with banks by
executing the embedded extension options in our original construction loan contracts, rightsizing the outstanding
balance if necessary, and thus waiting for a better rate environment to sell or refinance.
Again, some select information on CRE credit and various asset quality measurements. We have added some
LTV information to this slide. Our LTVs, we believe, are solid and as the chart indicates, with lots of room for
valuation adjustments should the markets require.
We have also analyzed recent loan renewals for non-owner occupied commercial real estate with principal
balances greater than $5 million and have seen some modest declines in LTV for these credits. The worst was a
$22 million office loan where the LTV went from 34% in January 2020. That was before the start of COVID and
before work from home with the thing to now 45% currently, an 11% reduction, but still very comfortable at 45%.
The best result was longer term, an $11 million hotel loan that moved from an LTV of 59% to now 38%. Both of
these loans are performing, and we have no reason to believe there's any issues with them.
We have experienced some increase in credit metrics and classified assets and NPLs from a year ago, but these
levels remain enviable in our humble opinion. Additionally, as to our market data, our occupancy levels remain
strong and rental rates have experienced several years of increases which has served to strengthen our
sponsors. Some of that information is also in the supplemental today.
Now on to page and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG and various other non-
recurring items, fee revenues were up 11.4% linked-quarter. We're pleased to report that our wealth management
units had a strong first quarter and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue in
the remainder of 2024.
The BOLI work we did last quarter is performing as planned, so expect to see incremental revenue from that
work, some in the second quarter but also into the third quarter. Asset mortgage servicing rights asset that Terry
mentioned earlier, we elected to record it this quarter. We have been serving Freddie Mac SBL loans since we
merged with Magna Bank in Memphis several years ago. SBL is the Small Business Lending program that
Freddie Mac offers. It's really the standard for agency-backed small apartment financing with loan amounts of $1

million to $7.5 million. PNFP originates the loan for Freddie, who purchases the loan with PNFP retaining the
servicing. Over the years and as we do each year, we perform strategic assessments on various business lines to
determine strategic fit, growth potential, cultural alignment, so on and so forth.
As rates escalated, the value of the servicing right increased, especially over the last several quarters. We've also
increased the volume of loans being serviced in that unit in recent years. In light of that, we obtained a third party
appraisal to determine the value at $11.8 million, which we will now need to revalue every quarter. All in, we are
raising guidance for fee revenues this year, primarily driven by the growth in our primary fee businesses. A range
of 10% to 14% seems reasonable, given the performance of several of our primary business lines in the first
quarter.
First quarter expenses came in slightly less than we anticipated after backing out the FDIC special assessment.
We, like everyone else, recorded the FDIC special assessment accrual of $7.25 million in additional expense in
the first quarter. Importantly, we've lowered our incentive target from 100% to 120% payout for fiscal year 2024 to
now 80% here at the end of the first quarter. Obviously, our goal is to bring it back to target this year, but that can't
happen unless we feel like we're going to achieve our financial targets. In the end, the relationship we created
since we started the firm between our financial performance and our incentive plan works is intentional and helps
ensure that we don't sacrifice wanting to benefit the other.
We have elected to keep our expense outlook unchanged to $950 million to $975 million for the year. You might
ask why that lowered more. We have some reasonably that we can fight our way back into this, so we hope to
give back to some – give back some of the incentive we eliminated in the first quarter. But we also have other
ways to manage our cost and we will deploy those as consider necessary. We believe our overall expense
outlook for 2024 is largely intact, so we're going to keep it consistent for that.
Now to the BHG. As the slide indicates, origination trends were down in the first quarter given the tighter credit
box and the impact of the macro interest rate environment. Last quarter, we had anticipated a flattish year as to
production. BHG believes that our 2024 production target is still in range, but a higher-for-longer rate environment
could impact those assumptions. As to placements, it was again a very strong quarter for sales into the bank
network and they also closed on their ninth securitization for $300 million. And as we mentioned in the press
release last night, with a net spread of greater than 10%, which we were all very excited to see. Also, my
understanding is that over 35 firm participated in the issuance, thus great demand for BHG paper. Also keep in
mind, the securitization added more than $30 million in provision expense to the first quarter results. BHG doesn't
anticipate another ABS issuance until probably the fourth quarter of this year.
As for spreads. Auction platform spreads, it widened during the first quarter today, totaling 8.1%, while the
balance sheet spreads are fairly consistent with prior quarter. All in, BHG believes spreads are holding in this rate
environment. BHG believes when rate decreases start, that will be a good thing for them, not only from a volume
perspective but also from a spread perspective.
On reserves and there's a lot of information on this slide. BHG did increase reserves during the first quarter for
both on and off-balance sheet loans. Modest uptick in the first quarter for credit losses for the off-balance sheet
business going from 3.1% to 3.3%. On balance sheet was a 6.8%. But the news is good as it pertains to BHG's
credit experience. We have been anticipating for at least a year or more that the first half of 2024 was critical to
our assumptions around credit improving. Even though the charge-off rates for all balance sheet increased during
the first quarter, the actual dollar value of charge-offs for all balance sheet decreased along with average
balances. That's why the charge off rate increased because the average balances went down. Even though the
charge off rate for both on and off balance sheet was up in the first quarter, BHG believes that they may have

turned the corner on tackling the COVID overhang of great inflation in 2021 and 2022. As the bottom left chart
indicates [ph] flat delinquencies (00:20:15), which are past dues greater than 30 days for all of BHG's loans, both
on and off balance sheet, appear to have topped off over the last few months and are bending down at the end of
the first quarter, especially in consumer credit. Also, BHG believes, based on information gathered from the rating
agency, their loss experience thus far, post-COVID will be better than that of other fintech competitors. Again, as
the past due chart indicates, the consumer loan is very encouraging. It's too early to declare victory, but BHG has
worked tirelessly to get back to their pre-COVID credit environment. More progress to come over the next few
quarters.
As to origination and earnings, achieving the same level of originations as last year will take great effort. That
said, BHG is not, and I emphasis on not, interested in adjusting their credit models to achieve volume goals.
Suffice it to say, as to placing BHG originated credit, the appetite for BHG's credit is as strong as ever. That in and
of itself should help spreads going forward. As to earnings, BHG is holding to their mid-single digit earnings
growth target for this year. Additionally, BHG has tactics they can deploy to help their bottom line and increase
potential earnings. The important assumption for BHG this year is what happens with credit. If improvement
continues, like we believe it will, BHG will have an impressive year.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.

Thanks, Harold. In general, it seems to me that the operating environment for banks is both difficult and volatile.
Inflation appears to be more difficult to tame than predict it, even as recently as several weeks ago by Jerome
Powell. It seems to me that rates are now more likely to stay higher-for-longer, resulting in an inverted yield curve
for longer. And with all the uncertainty and rapidly changing market conditions, bank stock investors are obviously
finding it challenging to forecast bank earnings and discern the dependable creators. And so, in my opinion, in this
environment, a company to PNFP that over the longer term has been able to generate such reliable growth
should be an attractive alternative. We've built a truly differentiated model that attracts the industry's best talents,
like none of its competitors and great raving fans like none of its competitors, which results in persistent growth of
clients and therefore persistent growth in loans, deposits and net interest income over the long haul. It's how we
consistently grew our EPS over the last decade without having to take on many of the risks that some of our –
some in our industry have taken, which almost always come home to roost in times of volatility.
In fact, we produce the highest total shareholder return among our peers over the last decade, a decade that
witnessed a great deal of volatility. Over the decade, I watched bank management taking extraordinary risk, and
investor themes change with every swing in market conditions. During the pandemic, slow growth and no growth
banks came in favor and we saw PEs for banks with net negative balance sheet growth, at least significantly
higher than for the growth banks. During the liquidity crisis, we saw valuations pickup for the money center banks
on one end and slow growth rural markets on the other versus high growth regions like PNFP.
During the Fed tightening cycle, we saw low deposit by the banks highly rewarded, while high paying banks like
PNFP were achieved. But through all of that, at Pinnacle, we simply focused on rapidly and reliably growing our
earnings stream, not values, not margins or trending edges, earnings.
Our approach at Pinnacle reminds me of the old John Houseman commercials for Smith Barney, where he said
they make money in the old-fashioned way. They earn it. During the last decade, our price the next 12 months
EPS contracted meaningfully. So then it becomes obvious that it was our ability to drive and grow earnings that
8

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
accounted for our peer leading total shareholder return and not any pickup in the multiple that investors were
signed in based on their most recent thesis.
And so let me be clear, at PNFP, our focus is primarily on sustainable long-term growth in earnings and tangible
book value. And I'm not saying that deposit cost bases are of no importance. I'm not saying it is meritless to
screen for NIMs or ROAs or efficiency ratios. I'm just saying at Pinnacle, our principal objective is sustainably
compounding earnings and compounded tangible book value.
So we could slow hiring, reduce noninterest expense, and improve our short-term earnings. We could concentrate
on lowering our deposit base instead of funding a high growth balance sheet and forego the once in a generation
opportunity, we have to continue taking market share from all our competitors. But instead, our focus is on
sustainable growth in earnings and compounding tangible book value.
And if we focus on sustainable earnings growth and compounded tangible book value, there is no chance you're
going to take a temporary influx of liquidity based on government stimulus and put it in securities due to short-
term earnings at the time when interest rates are near all-time lows. And you can't accept the duration risk of
lowering the balance sheet with unhedged long-term fixed rate mortgages when yields are at all-time lows. You
just accept the lower net interest margin in order to protect hard earned tangible book value that's your focus, you
protect loss absorbing capital.
There are banks that win best when rates are falling and there are banks that win best when rates are rising and
there are banks that have really low average deposit balances, all of which have garnered lofty multiples at one
time or another over the last decade. But in the banking business, perhaps the only way to consistently and
reliably produce total shareholder returns better than peers over the long-haul, because they have a sustainable
competitive advantage, a differentiated model and that's what I believe we have at Pinnacle.
This is the 2023 market tracking data from Greenwich Associates or Coalition Greenwich as they refer to
themselves now. The data for businesses with annual revenues from $1 million to $500 million in our market area
which for these purposes is defined as Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington DC and Atlanta,
Georgia. It compares the top 10 banks in the footprint. More specifically, in addition to Pinnacle, the top 10 banks
in that footprint include Truist, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, 1st Citizens Bank & Trust, PNC, First Horizon,
JPMorgan, Regions and SouthState.
Looking at client satisfaction on the left of the slide, the cross-hairs are set at the mean for the market penetration
on the Y-axis and the percentage of excellent client satisfaction ratings on the X-axis. So the banks in the top left
quadrant are the large share banks with the lowest level of client satisfaction as what we refer to as vulnerable
competitors. Banks in the lower right quadrant are the bank providing the highest level of client satisfaction,
theoretically the market share takers. And as you can see, PNFP provides the single highest level of client
satisfaction in our footprint. That differentiation and a particularly wide differentiation when compared to the
largest most vulnerable banks in the market.
And on the right side of the slide, you can see that the banks at the top with the highest overall client satisfaction
are generally the market share takers. Those are the banks with the improving market penetration over the last
year, as shown in the right most column. And the banks at the bottom of the list are the lowest client satisfaction
banks and their R&D give it up market share penetration.
Honestly, more important than client satisfaction scores is the net promoter score, satisfied clients are many times
leave if they get a better offer, while net promoters are substantially less likely to leave because they're
9

emotionally engaged with the brand. Not surprisingly, PNFP has the highest level of net promoters, not by a little
bit, but by a lot. And not only do we have far and away the highest percentage of promoters, but the Greenwich
survey data found no detractors, literally zero. [indiscernible] (28:41) study this comparison of the top 10 banks in
the Southeastern footprint, our sustainable competitive advantages begin to crystalize.
It's no secret that for relationship management – relationship managed banks like us, the quality, the relationship
managers must be the principal differentiator. Greenwich has identified seven important metrics that are valued
by business class. You see them listed in the first column there. In the right most column, you see the peer
comparison ratings for the same 10 competitors in our footprint that I just walked through. The blue bars represent
the range of scores for that set of 10 banks on that metric. The white line is the median score and the white circle
is the Pinnacle score for that metric. That being seen, the PNFP is the market leader for every single relationship
management metric. Think about that in terms of a sustainable competitive advantage, not only are we widely
viewed to be the most prolific hirer of relationship managers in our footprint, but the quality of those we've
attracted are literally the best in the market.
And as the slide progression, I want to make this point when we provide our outlook for loan growth as an
example, which is substantially higher than peers, some might fear that the risk profile is elevated as a result of
the high growth in loans. But hopefully, as you think about the fact that we're not only hiring the most relationship
managers in our footprint, which explains the high growth, but we're hiring the best relationship managers in our
footprint, which in my judgment should produce a lower risk profile, not a higher risk.
Much has been said and written about the advantages that the large money center banks have as a result of their
technology budgets and there is no doubt that every money center takes them with substantially swamp hour. But
using the similar graphic for 5% and regarding treasury management and the digital experience for the top 10
banks in our footprint, again, you see that Pinnacle actually have the single best perception among businesses
surveyed by Greenwich in our footprint, both in terms of capability and delivery. This is one of the clearest
examples of how we combine the tech and touch to create this sustainable competitive advantage. And ultimately
there is no more powerful brand among businesses in our footprint in Pinnacle's, Greenwich has identified five
pillars of brand perceptions among businesses. And as you can see, the range of scores for the top 10 banks in
our footprint is pretty wide. But again, Pinnacle is the leader on every single pillar.
And so as you think about sustainable competitive advantage, it's highly unlikely that competitors can easily
address their market perceptions for how easy they are to do business with, how trustworthy they are or whether
they value long-term relationships and so forth. Even if they recognize these substantial deficiencies and even if
they have the will to change and even if they're successful in addressing all the root causes of why they're so hard
to do business with and why they're not trusted and why they're viewed to not value long-term relationships, those
reputations in customers are more likely built over decades.
And so attempting to connect the dots for you on exactly why we've been able to gather clients faster than
competitors, why we've grown our interest earning assets faster than peers, and therefore our net interest income
faster than peers and therefore our EPS faster than peers over the last decade is because of the very hard work
we've done to build the kind of work environment that attracts not only the most, but the best talent in the industry
and to create a demonstrably differentiated level of service. That's why substantially less clients can see any
vulnerability in their relationship with us and substantially more clients and tend to reward us with more business
over the next 6 to 12 months, by far, than for any of our competitors.

That's the linkage from the work environment, which was recently running by Forbes magazine as the 11th best in
all the United States to the recruiting effectiveness, to the client experience, to the volume clients [indiscernible]
(32:40), and all of this bears on our outlook for the remainder of 2024 and for the next decade, for that matter.
So, Harold, let me turn it over to you.

Harold R. Carpenter
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. And now on the slide on our outlook for 2024, we've tightened our expectations in some cases and
modified others. In the end, we've concluded that our overall outlook for 2024 is basically consistent with last
quarter. I've listened to a few conference calls this quarter. There's a lot of chatter around world events, inflation,
M&A, politics, so on and so forth, and how those events are impacting their outlooks for 2024 and 2025.
For me, I find myself thinking a lot about interest rates and credit. I have a lot of confidence in where our balance
sheet sits with respect to both. I've mentioned to a few of my CFO friends over the last few years how I was a bit
envious of their asset sensitivity. Our goal is and have been managing our balance sheet with an aim towards
interest rate risk neutrality. We may drift slightly to either asset or liability sensitivity from time to time, but in the
end our belief is that we let the client gathering engine to see what drives our earnings growth.
As to credit, I've personally spent a lot of time with our credit team, also spent a lot of time with [indiscernible]
(33:56) in recent quarters, particularly our real estate lenders, are likely will spend even more time with all of them
for the rest of this year to try to better understand what happen to credit when rates go up or go down, as I should

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question
today is coming from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Casey, your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Quick question – question on the, I guess the NIM outlook. You guys
mentioned that it's – you expect it up in the second quarter and costs are down relative to the first quarter. But the
some of the yields – the loan yield, spot yields are lower than where they were in the first quarter and then the
muni bond yields were also lower. Just trying to get a sense of what's going on, on the yield side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, Casey this is Harold. I think the muni bond yields, there's a volume issue there. But I think we should
see some of that recover here in the second quarter. The deposit rate forecast, I think will be just a small increase
– what's really dependent on our NIM forecast is how well we do on fixed rate loan repricing and whether our DDA
accounts hang in there like we think they'll hang in there. So if those two things happen, we think our NIM forecast
is solid. Obviously, loan growth is an important element to all that. And so we still feel pretty good about the 9% to
11% loan growth for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Very good. And then I guess just switching to the BHG outlook, the guide implies a pretty steep ramp in the
remaining quarters here. Harold, you mentioned credit as a pretty significant wild card. Just wondering what does
that – how do you get BHG run rate up to that sort of mid $20 million level to hit that guide? Is it credit or is it more
originations? Just some color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we think originations are going to be probably a little better here for the rest of the year. What impacted the
first quarter a lot was the ABS placement. I don't think they're going to spend as much time working on balance
sheet kind of growth and they'll spend more time on the gain on sale part. But you're right, the credit is the issue.
We're all optimistic to see those bars turns out. And they feel pretty good about where they are right now.

Casey Haire Q

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Harold, maybe just start to go back to the question Casey just asked. When I look at the margin, it's pretty flat.
Earning asset yields are pretty flat. [ph] Deposit growth (38:14) are pretty flat this quarter. It's not really clear to
me what's driving the expectation for NIM expansion in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. Well, like I said, we've got a lot more fixed rate loans to reprice this quarter. We think also the work we
did at the end of the quarter on some deposits, preemptive strikes into the deposit book should also be helpful. So
those are – that [indiscernible] (38:44) balances hanging in there are the primary kind of tailwind to the margin
uplift.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. So you're expecting earning asset yield to pick up a bit in 2Q and deposit cost to come down a bit, is
that what you're saying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right.
[indiscernible] (39:03)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then on the expense side, we know you guys took the incentive comp down to 80% of target,
but kept the full year expense outlook intact. Can you just run through a little more detail what's expected to fill
that bucket up, [ph] why we're (39:20) still the same expense outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
All right. So what we elected to do is not take it down, so we're going to keep it the same. We felt like as that
played into our overall outlook for 2024, that was the fair thing to do. If the incentive accrual gets reapplied, so we
add back the – call it the $30 million bucks into the incentive accrual for the year, that will come out obviously with
13

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
revenue increases, but we have other opportunities to manage our expense outlook to kind of keep that still within
that $950 million to $975 million, if that makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess the one wildcard with the new hiring was really solid sort of 37 new
hires. What is embedded in the expense outlook or is this going to be a much stronger year than typical for hiring
just given the pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we put in the – as far as the plan for this year, basically the same hiring profile for 2024 as 2023. I'll
have to go back and look at my numbers, but I think overall head count was up 100 people or so last year,
something like that. So....
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q

They're similar.

Thanks. Good morning.

Hey, Catherin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One more on the margin. [ph] So, good morning (41:18). One more on the margin, Harold. So you mentioned that
even in a no rate cut scenario, the neutral to your outlook on your NII guide, how should we think about the risk,
the downside risk to growth if we don't see rate cut later on this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question, Catherine. I think it will impact growth maybe to the low end of our number. But at
the same time, a lot of our growth, if you look there's a chart in the back that shows where our loan growth came
in the first quarter and it all came from new markets, new people. And so that's what we're leaning into as far as
our – basically our loan growth for the whole year. We're not expecting any significant growth, call it, it does not
go 11 overall, we might be looking in the legacy markets for call it 5 to 7. So that chart in the back would show
that we didn't have hardly any growth, but we had negative growth in the legacy markets in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then similarly, on the margin, in a scenario where we don't have cuts, do you feel like there's
enough momentum in DDA balances holding in and you've got better fixed rate loan rate repricing for the back
half of the year that the margin continues to expand throughout the rest of the year with cuts or even without cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we're keeping our fingers crossed on that for sure. Right now, our average DDA balances as far as
individual accounts are pretty consistent with pre-COVID. There might be a little excess there that we need to
worry about, but so far so good with respect to that. But that's a real important kind of component to the overall
kind of net interest income plan for the year.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
For sure. Okay, great. Thanks. And perhaps one just really small question, if you don't mind. Service charges
were a lot higher this quarter. Any color on what's going on there? Is that a good run rate to grow from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't think there's anything specific that we can talk about. Maybe Terry has got some ideas here. But I think we
did do some kind of like everybody looking at [indiscernible] (43:37), looking at the fee waivers, looking at things
like that, where we've over the years kind of just gotten into maybe some places with certain class where we need
to kind of go readdress some of those charges. But I don't think we did any kind of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. There were no universal price changes. There were some initiatives that were aimed at review in long-term
waivers, long-term special pricing, those kinds of things that I think it made a difference.

Hey, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So just to run out the deposit cost [ph] question (44:26), I think I've heard [ph] mixed things (44:28). So are you
expecting interest-bearing deposit costs to incrementally creep a little higher from here? Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think they will creep, but it will be 1 basis points to 2 basis points. I don't think it will be any more than that.
I think our group is doing a good job of holding the line on deposit cost. So long as our core deposit kind of growth
continues, I think that will be accurate. If for some reason core deposit growth doesn't happen [ph] the way the
wholesale market (44:59) that money is – that money is really expensive and we're hoping not to do that. So, so
far so good.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, Harold, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there could be other ways to manage
costs besides the incentive accrual. So do you care to go into more details about what could potentially be done
on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Oh, yeah. Well, we could always delay hiring. For all practical purposes, our hiring plan for support units is really
restricted right now, not to put a damper on the call, but we can do that. We can delay hiring. We've [indiscernible]
(45:41) to start this year, we could delay those. There's several things that we can do in order to kind of bring the
expense number back in line if we need to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then just lastly on BOLI came in around $11 million in the quarter. I think you mentioned that
you could see some incremental revenue from that. So should we expect that kind of $11 million figure to
increase incrementally or should that normalize to a small amount?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think probably, call it $10 million is probably a fair number to think about going forward. There were some
death benefits in the first quarter, but yeah, I think somewhere call it $10 million-ish is probably a fair number for
both.

Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess one of my first question here was just curious around customer kind of

pushback or kind of what are the dynamics there as you reprice these loans?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
I think it is fair that there is more acclimation on the client's part to higher fixed rate quote. So that's a true
statement. But I wouldn't – won't act like it's easy. I mean, it's a dogfight for sure. But, I think during the quarter,
our repricing was it 7.35. The target is at 7.5 to 8. So we're within striking distance and it's way up from where it
was. So again I don't want to act like it's easy. It's not easy. But we are getting it done. And I think, it's the
combination of the clients' acclimation to the rate, I think some of the distinctive service levels and so forth, the
client loyalty is an important variable in there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, that makes sense. And I would think I mean, the renewal spreads look like they continue to widen a bit.
And is that largely a function of just the 2021 kind of vintage originations being the lowest yielding fixed rate loans
that remain on the books?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Stephen, I don't know if I got all the question, but there's a chart that's on the loan slide. That first
bar is the biggest as far as rates. I think, it came in like 4.90% is what the kind of the – is what the renewal rate is
coming into the second quarter. And the reason is that is probably at the tail end of where before rates started
coming down back a few years ago. So that's why that line on that chart is [ph] higher than (48:59) 4.90% and
then it drops pretty meaningfully down into the 4.60s, down into the 4.40s over the rest of this year. Does that
make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. That's perfect. Thanks for pointing that out. And then just last thing for me, I know there were times in the
past, 10, 12 years when you guys have done a really good job of having floors in place before rates went down
and taking them off with rates coming higher. Do you have any meaningful floors in the portfolio today or is that –
has that been a part of the pricing conversation at this point in time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we've got floors in place and we've got some balance sheet floors. I think we've got $3 billion to $4 billion in
covering some of the floating rate credit. But largely we've encouraged floors at the line of scrimmage into
individual loan contracts. I don't have the number as to what that is today, but I'll dig it out and I'll get it to you.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Harold, I know you guys have a pretty robust
assumption for deposit betas on the way down. Is there been any change of that? And what is the kind of swing
factor there if we don't get any cuts this year as it relates to kind of the NII guide? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think on the short end, I don't think there's a whole lot of change in our NII guide today, Michael. We still
plan on and our relationship managers are well aware and they've been informing their clients that when rates do
come down we will be aggressive on the downside. I think, we've gone back and looked at what our beta was on
the way up on our negotiated rates, it was like 80% – 70% or 80%, somewhere in that range. So we intend to be
aggressive on the way down. I think the critical question is around what happens if rates don't move from here.
Again, I think on the short end and also for the near term, we feel like it's fairly neutral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the deposit growth. You guys have done a great job over a very long
period of time, growing deposits. Can you just talk about the complexion of the growth, maybe how much will
come from some of the more expansionary markets that might be higher cost than mature just given, maybe
some introductory or teaser rates as you build out those markets versus what you're expecting in the legacy
markets? And how that could – from a yield or from a cost perspective how that could be a swing factor, if we are
higher-for-longer? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Michael, I think, when we look at the deposit growth that really we generated for the better part of last year
and our outlook for 2024, the biggest single component of that deposit growth is the deposit specialties that we've
developed over the last several years. And I won't go through or bore you with all those things, but I think, [ph]
you maybe (00:52:24) you've heard us talk about deposit products that we have for escrow accounting, deposit
products that we have for captive insurance businesses, deposit products that we have for bankruptcy trustees. I
mean, there are a variety of these specialties that we've focused on and built over the last several years, really
trying to make sure we add some value add for particularly large pools of money. And so, we've developed a
mechanism where we've got market champions in every market for all those products, and there's a lot of energy
on targeted calling on clients that utilize those particular products. And so, in all honesty, I think the biggest piece
of the growth comes from what we're able to produce [ph] with these (00:53:09) deposit specialty.
There is no doubt, we're also benefited by what goes on in our market extensions as you're growing off a base of
zero. So, all the numbers look pretty good there. But as it relates to teaser rates and so forth, I'd just like to keep
in mind, we're not – those strategies are not retail in any way, shape or form. So we're not doing rate promotions
or any of that kind of thing. There's no doubt you're moving market share, you're generally not going to convince
client to move from where they are to here and pay them a lot less than what they're getting paid. So, again, I
don't mean to act like there's no price pressure. There certainly is. But again, it's not a [ph] retail teaser rate
(00:53:49) kind of strategy. But again, I'd point you back to the deposit specialties.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
No, I appreciate the context. And maybe just last one for me. I know you had two credits that have drove a little bit
of an increase in NPLs. Obviously, very low level. You built the reserves. Can you just help us get comfortable, I
know there's been a lot written about multifamily supply coming online in some of your markets, particularly
Nashville and down to Atlanta is being some of the highest? Just as it relates to kind of your specific reserves
against commercial real estate, I think they're, sub 1% for the last call record, so. Can you just help us get
comfortable that you guys are kind of well reserved and you'll see migration but you aren't overly worried about
credit? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah the – what we're leaning into is probably one of the – well, it is, almost – high performing segment in my
loan portfolio is my commercial real estate side. And that's been true for many, many, many years. Where we get
choppy is in the C&I book, when things happen. So I think it has to do with just looking at the macro environment
where we are with these loan to values and our multifamily book, we think is as strong as it's ever been. Our
rental rates are at 95%, 98%. Loan to values in the 60% range. I think, it's by and large on the macro side is
where we get it. I think where else I'd get comfort is when I interview my real estate lenders and my credit officers,
they're able to talk in very granular, granular way about all these multifamily projects and sponsors. So I believe
we're on them and I think we understand what the markets are. I don't think we have any significant appetite at all
for multifamily right now. I think we believe that we like our book and we like our sponsors.

Yeah, I'm not going to get into actual EPS targets, what it takes to get to 80% kind of [ph] award (00:57:04). You
can look at the proxy and see how it works over time and the tearing and how the revenue component flows
through it and all that. But basically, we have to reconcile where we think we're going to be for the year to what
we're going to accrue in that incentive bucket every quarter. And that's not only true for cash, but also for equity.
So we have to go through a process to try to make sure we right-size that accrual every quarter to where we think
maturing is with the plan for the year. I don't know if that gets at your question generally, but maybe I'll follow up.

Yeah. I guess, it's relative to the guidance, if you hit your guidance, does that equal 80% on the incentive or is
there upside to that number if the guidance is [ph] hit (00:57:55) downside to that number, if the guidance is hit. I
guess, is that 80% relative to your broader guidance?

M. Terry Turner A

Okay. I guess on the loan book just looking at linked-quarter construction loans, that reduction there in your
broader commentary around where you want to get that as a percentage of capital. I guess, what does the
contractual funding look like in the construction book? [ph] Has lot of that (00:58:46) already taken place from
originations booked in prior years or is that comment on working that down on a relative basis to capital more, so
just the other segments growing faster than the construction bucket?

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, we went – effectively, we went pencils down on construction about a year, maybe [ph] 1.5 years ago
(00:59:07). So new commitments, we limited to already kind of a to developer sponsors that we had already
previously committed. So we're still funding up on some of those commitments. But as it turned out now, the
funding on these older projects is not keeping up with the projects that are getting their certificate of occupancy.
So once they get that certificate of occupancy, they move out of construction and they either go to the private
market, they either get paid off or the project gets sold, or we move it into commercial real estate. So we
anticipate that over the rest of the year, that will still happen, that our funding for new construction will not be as
not be large enough to meet that 70% – we will still go down on that 70% – towards that 70% based on actual
fundings. And then projects as they complete will move out of that construction bucket.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start with...

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I wanted to start with the hires, and I know that you doubled the Jacksonville team already. I'm curious where –
what geographies you're more interested in growing from here? And if anything that's going on with interest rates
or higher rates for longer, maybe that slows some of your projects, are there any new markets on the table at this
point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, Brett, I think, in terms of hiring, Jacksonville, obviously is a key area of hiring, as are the other newer markets,
specifically DC, Atlanta and so forth. So there is incremental hiring all over the footprint. I would say it's a pretty
good time for us to be attracting talent universally. But clearly, there's a concentration in the newer markets, which
is where the hiring is currently occurring.

And then, I guess as it relates to new markets, I know you've heard me say this before, we love the Southeastern
markets, all the large urban markets in the Southeast. The principal voids are in Florida. But the catalyst for when
we go is when there's availability of a team that we feel like can build us a big bank. And so that was the catalyst
for why we went to Jacksonville when we did. We had a fabulous leadership team that I think is really
extraordinary and we're going to build something special there. And we may find our way to other markets when
that same phenomenon occurs, but we're not trying to get other markets, we're not working on how to get out of
the markets and so forth. So I hope I'm addressing what you asked, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. That's helpful, Terry. And then the other quick question was around slide 23 where you have the customer
penetration and the overall satisfaction levels. And I'm curious if, I get that the national banks are the higher
customer penetration levels, but is that an area of opportunity for you either client-by-client or product set to grow
the penetration on your clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Absolutely. That's really the whole point to me, Brett, is, across that whole footprint, we have markets, we
dominate like a national. But across the whole footprint, we're in some really hands of markets, where we're a low
share player. And so, as I look at that chart, what I'd say is, okay, what I want to do is attack those banks that are
in the top left because they've got all the share and all the vulnerability. And so, that's exactly the play that we
have been making. That's where we produced our share growth over the last, almost for a decade now, and that's
where I would expect the growth to continue to come.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
And any idea, Terry, where your natural penetration would be versus the overall footprint?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Want to go back to the discussion around loan yields, and I think the loan yields
increased this quarter around 5 bps. And I think you mentioned the benefits of the fixed rate repricing tailwinds
could build throughout the year. So, any color for us as far as how we can be modeling those loan yields over the
next few quarters, assuming no rate changes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think if you can – I think our loan growth will be fairly – we should get into that 9% to 11% range. So, I don't
think it'll be – there's any kind of meaningful seasonality there, Matt. So, as you plan out the loan growth, do that
and that I think you'll have to back into what our margin expectations are. The loan yield we believe will be
accretive. We think we'll do more accretion here in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. Gosh, I'm
trying to give you some direction here. I think $3 billion – if you [ph] wipe (01:05:42) $3 billion of new loans coming
in at, call it, 7.35% or 7.40%, that would be [ph] helpful (01:05:48).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. We'll look at that. And then, I guess, kind of a similar question, Harold, on the securities yields, you
had some nice repricing all through 2023. I think you've got one of the higher yielding securities books in the peer
group. Any more benefits this year, if we assume higher-for-longer, or are we kind of topping out here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think we're getting close to kind of the top, but we ought to see some accretion in the, call it, the second
quarter. It won't be a lot, but hopefully, we'll see some, especially on the cash side. We had a kind of a larger mix
of, call it, cash balances versus the Fed account here in the first quarter than we typically carry. So, we're likely to
see more money at the Fed earning the higher rate on the cash side.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the fixed rate loan yields for a moment. The current originations
are obviously a little bit below the target range of the 7.5% to 8%. And so, I wanted to get a sense of, especially
with the potential rate hike in September, do you expect to hit the low end or the middle of that range, for that
target range? Or should we just sort of expect that this is going to stay below 7.50% for 2Q, 3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
As far as new accounts go, Samuel, we're actually pretty pleased with they're hitting 7.35%. We did have, call it, a
handful of larger credits that booked in the first quarter at, call it, in the high-6s, that did dilute that target from
7.50% down to 7.35%. Am I getting to your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, that's perfect. That's very helpful. Thank you, Harold. And then, the other question was just on credit. So,
you upped the [indiscernible] (01:08:04) guide a little bit, obviously gave some commentary around that [ph] MTA
(01:08:07) and specific reserve. Just wanted to get a sense of like the move to the 20 to 25 basis points, is that –
should we expect that to be a chunky sort of outcome or is this a more broad-based sort of expectation of moving
[indiscernible] (01:08:24) content?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, for our planning, I think that's a great question. I think it will end up being chunky. But right now, we're
seeing as a fairly consistent. So, we don't see a big rise in it in the second quarter versus the third quarter versus
the fourth quarter. I think what we're planning is to be fairly consistent from here on out.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe just looking at the – going back to the penetration – market penetration slide, how
should we be thinking about maybe longer term loan growth from here, like looking out 2025, 2026 as you're able
to take market share in these high growth markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'm not sure. Ask it again, Jared. I'm sorry. I'm not – I didn't quite get it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, just with all the hiring you've been doing with people who are the best in their markets and
going into higher growth markets, how should we be thinking about longer term loan growth, if we look out maybe
over 2025 and 2026, as you are able to successfully or hopefully successfully take market share in these
markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, my expectation is that it will work like it has worked. And when I say that, I think the last few quarters, we've
had a slide up in the actual call, presentation deck that sort of show what was coming from all the new hiring
versus not from the new hiring. And of course, as you know, it's substantially from the new hiring. I think that slide
found its way to the back of the deck as in the additional slides in the [ph] back (01:10:25) that you can see in the
percentages coming from there.
And so, my expectation is, that phenomenon will continue out for 2025 and 2026, [ph] both because (01:10:34)
we'll continue to hire more people and they'll continue to move those books. And so, what I think, I mean, 6% loan
growth is a pretty good number, at least based on what I expect other people are able to produce. But it is – that
is being done with legacy markets that are – have more tepid growth. And so, once you get to a better economic
landscape and you get the growth out of those legacy markets, as we've talked a lot, Jared, the growth that come
from the new hires is not dependent upon economic conditions, but the growth in the legacy markets is.
And so, anyway, I don't mean to go on too much, but I expect that phenomenon to continue. We'll hire more
people, they'll move their clients. It will produce outsized growth as it has for some time and so forth. And then, if
you get a tailwind here, when economic conditions improve, you're ought to produce even more outsized growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And then, there's something for me on BHG. I mean, Harold, maybe where do you see reserves
peaking there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I can't really – yeah, what they told me, Jared, is that they believe the reserves are – will probably maybe
tweak up some from here, but basically flattish from here [ph] on out (01:12:09). They feel like they're in pretty
good shape with respect to the absolute levels, the percentage levels in relation to loans.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Most of mine have been answered here. Just a couple minor things. Harold, just on the loan repricing
that occurs, the 300 basis points is helpful. Is there a significant amount or a similar amount of that repricing that
goes in next year as well, just kind of thinking further out on the fixed rate side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think that chart would show, Brian, something like, I think the blue bars go down the like $750 million or
something [ph] a quarter (01:12:52) in 2025, in some neighborhood like that. One thing and I hope Matt's still on
the phone that I remembered, is that the mix of our new loan generation now has gone from a 60-40 floating rate
to a 60% floating to 40% fixed. Today, it's running probably around 75% floating to 20%, 25% fixed. So, those
floating rate credits are coming on at a higher yield than the [ph] 7.35% or the 7.54% (01:13:23) fixed rate. So,
that's another kind of tailwind that we've had to loan yields. That will happen again in the fourth – in the second
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. So, that margin should continue to ramp, if that repricing occurs and the deposits are stabilizing. So,
okay. And then, Harold, just housekeeping on the equity investment line and the other, in the fee income line, is
there anything funky this quarter or is that a pretty clean, pretty normal type of level on those equity investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I don't recall anything going on. We did have a solar gain again this quarter, but we think that's going to be
replicated throughout the year. So, I don't – we didn't point out any kind of a unusual number for that line item.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Understood. And then, just – the last one was just on the deposit, the proactive, preemptive strikes you
talked about. Is that continuing in second quarter or I guess, if you kind of backed off that or I guess, is that – do
you expect that to kind of continue and also support your kind of your margin commentary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Brian, it's a great question. What we have done is conduct an initiative where we asked people to go through and
review and gave lists and try to provide infrastructure and basis for decent rates and so forth. So, that initiative
has been done. But I mean, my view of it in this environment is [ph] it's a war (01:14:50).
