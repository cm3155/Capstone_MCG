Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first
quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings
power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus
and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the
returns we generated this quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2024
As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives: to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients
with excellence; to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at scale.
Across the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back
on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of
a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity
wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise
capital, and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors.
Where we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of reopening of the capital markets, with the first
few months of 2024 seeing a reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of
large IPOs across geographies, and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs of Galderma,
Reddit and RENK is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing.
In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment in investment
grades, with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major
theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance
backdrop, as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activities, we expect
solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year.
With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in
helping our clients access the markets, and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the
10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening we are seeing in capital markets, our
intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing
revenues across FICC and equities which, together, were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All in,
our top-tier intermediation franchise and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in Global
Banking & Markets.
In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which
represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform
across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to
invest resources in growing this business, particularly across wealth management, alternatives and solutions.
In wealth management, we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In
alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments, despite a more difficult fundraising environment. And in
solutions, we saw continued demand for outsourced CIO and SMA offerings. These are all areas in which we still
see significant opportunities and where we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win.
I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, artificial intelligence. While
there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is enormous appetite for perspectives on
how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulation,
impacts on jobs, and where value will prove in the ecosystem. Today, we are proud to be at the forefront of
advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer
term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectation, there will be significant demand for AI-
related infrastructure, and as a result, financing, which will be a tailwind to our business.
For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine
learning and artificial intelligence applications. We are focused on enhancing productivity, particularly for our

developers and increasing operating efficiency, while maintaining a high bar for quality, security and controls. Like
with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial.
Turning to the macro environment. We continue to be constructive on the health of the US economy. The Fed
most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This
will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I'm also mindful that US equity markets are hovering near-
record levels at a time when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inflation, the commercial
real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth, but
that said, the US economy has proven to be resilient supported by a number of factors, including government
spending, as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration.
So while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain.
Nonetheless, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of
collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am
consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of
our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver
for clients and shareholders.
I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we
generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $11.58,
an ROE of 14.8%, and a ROTE of 15.9%. We provide details on the financial impact of selected items in the
bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter.
Let's turn to performance by segments, starting on page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7
billion in the first quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully-allocated basis.
Turning to page 4, advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions.
We remain number one in the lead tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues
of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose significantly year-over-year amid an
increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to
market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust.
FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled
franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by
better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to
effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes. We produced record FICC
financing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. We remain
confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time.
Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14%
year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly
higher year-over-year, as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower
financing spreads.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2024
Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5, revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year.
Record management and other fees were up 7% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we closed the sale
of Personal Financial Management in November of last year, which contributed approximately $60 million in fees
in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Based
on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium-
term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end.
Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior-year period
were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt
investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year
in our private portfolio, that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position.
Now moving to page 6, total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. We had $24
billion of long-term net inflows, largely in fixed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-
based inflows.
Turning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the first
quarter, driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the
quarter. We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in alternatives across private equity
and other strategies this year. More broadly, we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private
credit to capitalize on the secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to
$300 billion over the next five years.
On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the first quarter, we reduced our
historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. We expect reductions at roughly this pace
for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026, consistent
with our target.
Next, Platform Solutions on page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment profitability has improved with
a pre-tax net loss of $117 million for the quarter. In line with our target, we expect the drive this business to pre-
tax breakeven next year.
On page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up sequentially on an increase in
interest earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth
quarter, as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky
portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card
lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last
few quarters.
Turning to page 10, we continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know, we
moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in
AWM, alternative, equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at risk related to CIEs.
Turning to expenses on page 11, total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efficiency
ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reflecting improved operating performance for
the firm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year even inclusive of the
$78 million FDIC special assessment charge and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter. Our effective tax
rate for the quarter was 21.1%, and for the full year we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%.

Now on to slide 12, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the first quarter under the
standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock
repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with 170 basis
point buffer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for significant modifications to the Basel III
proposed rule, we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment. We also remain committed to
paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend.
In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and
our growing Asset & Wealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would
do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas in 2024 that we laid out in January,
which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to
deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients, and remain optimistic about the future opportunity
set for Goldman Sachs.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator
Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. [indiscernible] (00:15:29) you are definitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out,
and of course the sustainability of banking is what it is. I noticed your lower pipeline. But the real question I have
is the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on
everything. Comp was up with that normally, but non-comp was down, the provision was down, and RWA didn't
increase even though you were growing your financing. So, I'm giving you a softball here and just saying what of
that package can continue to stick?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I appreciate it, Glenn, and I think there are bunch of things that continue to stick, because one of the things
you know what we've been focused on is building a more durable business, and that there are a handful of things
when you look across the whole package where we've made significant progress over the course of the last five
years. Certainly building our financing business and our markets business is something that's more durable and
more sustainable. We still think there's lots of room to grow. And, look, the world's growing. I mean, the world
grows and our clients grow. They need us to finance them. We've got the capital to deploy as long as we can
drive attractive returns with that client base. And so we stay focused on that.
We've doubled our management fees on our Asset & Wealth Management business over the last five years, and
we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. Those are more durable revenues.
And there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. You've seen the
margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like

that business to have, and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress
there.
Overall, I think we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very, very
focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. And
we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet
shares sticky? I think the wallet shares are, what I can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every
quarter to quarter. But when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these
businesses, and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns
where we're very well positioned and we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I definitely appreciate all that. And could we talk just – follow up on just the non-comp piece and talk – you had
some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuff. So, are those at actually run rate
levels now going forward also? Because that was a nice positive surprise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning, Glenn. It's Denis. As we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very, very focused
on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. There clearly are inflationary pressures that impact a
number of items in our non-comp expense. The sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the
year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily
expect to repeat. And so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-
comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very, very focused on managing in a disciplined
fashion. But I think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.

Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to follow up, David. You mentioned AI, and would love that that's still – it's
hard in our seats to figure out what's hype, what's real. If you can double-click on some of the comments you
made around comparing what's going on with AI today versus maybe the dot-com bubble around the runway this
might create for capital markets/IB, not just for this year, but beyond. And then also the other side around, is there
line of sight of how much more efficient Goldman itself can get by deploying AI? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, I mean, big picture, and look, I'm not a stock picker, so I'm not going to comment when you make a
comparison to the Internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001. I'm not going to comment around that. I think we've got
a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that I think have an enormous competitive
advantage around the scaling of these technologies. But broadly speaking, these technologies require certain
things, including infrastructure, power, and these things require financing to drive the scale that's going to be
necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses
competitive at pace. And that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business
that we've seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2024
So I actually think there's a very, very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people
reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented. And so, I think
that opportunity is something over the course – this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next 5 to 10
years. And we're very, very focused on it and very engaged.
And by the way, it's not just companies, it's governments obviously that are making enormous investments in
bringing infrastructure into their locales. And so, all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on.
Double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on Goldman Sachs, I would just say we see enormous
opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency. Our use cases that we're testing and that
we're implementing focus on those two areas. But I'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability
to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients, rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes
very cost accretive.
I think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with
clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity and also when we
look at our data sets and what we have internally, an ability to deliver them a value-added package of information,
thought process that we think can be differentiated. And so we're very focused on the productivity side. Although,
of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency and we're also focused on
bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's good color. Thank you. And just separately, for the Goldman stock, right, I think from an investor
standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of asset management. You've talked about the
HPIs coming down, alt assets going up. How else should shareholders and prospective investors think about
strategy around growing the asset management revenues? And is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and
in terms of how management is thinking about things today? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, in January, we said to you we thought high-single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital
density over time. We're executing on that. We are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. Firm
obviously generates a lot of capital. There could be a time in the future where something might come up that
could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. But at the moment, our focus is on the
execution of what we have in front of us, and we are making good progress. But I think we've put out a handful of
metrics both in terms of top line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise. You saw that we highlighted $15
billion of fundraising in alternatives in the first quarter. We said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this
year. Obviously, the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year.
That doesn't stop this year. We think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of
years going forward.
So we're focused on the things that matter in asset management, what matters? Performance matters, client
experience matters. We're incredibly focused on both those things, and working hard to make sure we use our
global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very effectively.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning, guys. Maybe I'll ask Glenn's question in a different way. If I look at that 18% ROE for the Global
Banking & Markets business, it really catches my eye here. So how would you characterize this quarter's
performance? Is it like sort of normal-ish to you? Does it feel maybe peak-ish to you? Again, just trying to figure
out if 18% ROE is anywhere [ph] near (00:25:11) sustainable for that business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
There's no way to [ph] say (00:25:22) this, it was a strong quarter for Global Banking & Markets. Peak, I mean, I
can point in the last few years to quarters in Global Banking & Markets where the returns were higher. But I
certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in Global Banking & Markets. We've
said clearly we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. The performance this quarter was higher.
There were performance last year, was meaningfully lower. I think the right thing to focus on, Christian, is mid-
teens through the cycle, that's the way we think about it. And there was client activity and opportunity set for us
this quarter, and I think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with
our clients, there is opportunity in the market, we're good at capturing that, delivering that to shareholders. And
then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people
may have looked at it in the past. But I would view this as a very strong quarter in Global Banking & Markets and
not what we would target as the average run rates of the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe onto private wealth, if I'm reading slide 9 correctly, you had something like $17
billion of inflows into wealth management AUS. So that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which
is well above peers. I would call it best-in-class. So can you give more color on what's driving that growth? Maybe
any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? And again, longer-term how you're thinking
about sustainability of that level of organic growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah, again, this I think comes down to focus. And you know we made some very – we talk about conscious
decisions. We had talked about broadening our wealth platform to get much more broadly into what I'd call kind of
high net worth wealth management, and with the sale of United Capital, we continue to be very focused on our
ultra-high net worth platform. It is an extraordinary platform. I do think it's a best-in-class platform. I do think that
the ultra-high net worth business is still a very fragmented business, while we have leading share, I think those
shares are still on a global basis a leader as a single-digit share. There's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot
of wealth accumulating. We are very, very well positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. And I think the
business is performing very, very well.
Our alts franchise I think is differentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. I
think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. We're expanding our private banking activity. That's
not something that we have been focused on, which I think is also strengthening our position as a wealth
manager. So I think there's a good runway for this business. I do think it's a best-in-class franchise that has room

around how we're going to focus this business, I think we're benefiting from at the moment.

better than run rate on average over time, but it doesn't take away from the fact that 1Q was very strong. And I
just wanted to understand was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and fixed
income, for example, that were different this quarter? And the reason I ask is VaR efficiency was so strong, right.
You've delivered very strong trading revenues on VaR that was basically flat Q on Q, I mean, a little down, a little
up, depending on which asset class you're looking at. So was there anything in when you mentioned you stepped
in to client activity and opportunity set, was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to
do this in a way that didn't really tag VaR at all?

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Look, to give you some color on that, I wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. I would say the revenue
generation and the activity was broad-based. But in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share
and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk
intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes, and I would observe that over the
course of the quarter, it was just a very benign operating environment. Credit spreads were tightening, equity
valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our Global Banking &
Markets business as well.
The first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. So we think we really captured a lot of the
opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. And as David said, that may
not necessarily be the case each and every quarter, particularly in FICC and equities. So when we talk about like
a Global Banking & Markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance
across both FICC and equities in Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Super. That's really helpful. Thanks for the incremental color there. Just one other follow-up. David, you
mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the wealth platform that you've got. Could you just give us
a little more color as to what we're thinking about there that we should understand? Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I think one of the things that our wealth management franchise finds very attractive is we run an open
platform. And so, when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very, very broad, very, very deep, very, very unique
offering as one of the top five or six alt providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what
we're manufacturing out of our asset management business. But in addition, we want an open platform where we
deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different world-class managers around the world
across the spectrum. And so, I think that's a very, very unique offering that very, very affluent people who wealth
manage at Goldman Sachs find super attractive and super differentiated.

Brennan Hawken Q

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, wanted to ask one on your M&A franchise. So the recovery in
announced M&A has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategics. And given your strong
franchise among sponsors, curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe
when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2024
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah, Brennan, appreciate that question, and that's a sharp observation on your part. The sponsor activity is still
muted, but I would say it's definitely picking up. The engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully
improved. And as I've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying
things and selling things and the level of activity has been incredibly muted, and when you look at the LP
community, the LP community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more
capital and increase the velocity of capital return.
And so, I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. I'd say the activity and interaction and
engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout 2023. But I would say it's still operating at lower
levels. There's a lot of upside for our business. Our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity, and
so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets
broadly.
When I look at our leveraged finance deals book, it's still operating at historically very, very low levels. We feel
fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital flexibility. That was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously
very accretive and attractive business. We're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but I think it's coming, and
certainly the sustained level we've had over the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not
sustainable. It will pick up. It's just a question of when. And so that is a potential tailwind to our business in future
quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that color, David. I appreciate it. And then another question on alts. So, fundraising looks really
good. I know there can be some noise in the revenue. So just curious about the alts' revenue down year-over-
year and the AUS only up sort of marginally sequentially. Could you give us some color around what was
happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Brennan, it's Denis. So, couple of things. Obviously the movement in AUS is a function of how we fundraise,
how we deploy, and overall levels. We have had a lot of success fundraising not just in the last quarter at $14
billion, but now with the full 265-plus billion since the original Investor Day, but there is a lag in terms of when
some of that capital is put to a use and actually moves into AUS. Not all of our funds that are raised are AUS
immediately. So I think that is something you can look out for in future periods.
And then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as David was walking through our platform, our wealth
platform in terms of having Goldman Sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture or third-party platform, some
of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform as we look over the sequential
period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the quarter than we did in
the fourth quarter last year.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. David, you reiterated the desire for Goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some
cleanup from the past charges this quarter for GreenSky, the GM card, Platform Solutions still lost $117 million.
So I'm just trying to figure out in this context where transaction banking stands. I mean, you had 8% year-over-
year growth, so that's decent. But three years ago, March 1, you guys said transaction banking, you're building
global payments around the world. And then March 8 of this year on Bloomberg, it says that you're closing Japan
and now you're focusing on the US and Europe. So, on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions?
On the other hand, maybe you have more financial discipline and you're making sure these adjacent activities are
generating profits instead of just growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Look, Mike, I think you summarized it well. I think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. We're looking
hard. We are – I think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. We think
we've got very, very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. But
there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately, and that it's not just top line
growth, that it delivers profitability. It's something that fits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things
that we can bring to our clients.
I think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately, and so
we've narrowed that. But we remain committed, focused and growing, and I think this is a medium- and longer-
term project that we will deliver on. It's small. But I think we've got the right focus. We made a hire to bolster the
expertise and the leadership, and we're moving forward on that strategy.
And with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and clean up the after-tax loss from the platforms. It was
less than $100 million. We've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or
profitability in 2025, and we're executing against that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just to follow up on the transaction banking, you said some ambitions were too broad. Again, it's better to have
profitable growth than just growth. So, point acknowledged. But what happened? I mean, where were you kind of
underestimating expenses or the build-out costs or what was more difficult than you had anticipated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think there were a number of things, Mike, that came together. I think when you're building new
businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you
hold people accountable as you advance. And I think there were things where we thought we could do more
globally. And candidly, when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in
that context. And so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. That doesn't
mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think, for now, that's the right action.
I'd say secondarily, the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created
headwinds and a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. And so that's
something else that went into the mix. And so, look, I think one of the things that we try to do is to look at

everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional, and to be willing to say, okay, this isn't exactly
right, so we're going to adjust. And I think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always
with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders, driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive
returns to shareholders when we get some things right, when we get some things wrong, but when we look at the
information, the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning, guys. Wanted to follow up, David, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity.
Private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. Just wanted to better
understand what you're seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting
your IB and alt franchises. And just given some of the recent press coverage, maybe just speak to your growth
ambitions in the private credit space more broadly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I'll make a couple of comments, but I'm going to ask Denis to comment, too, because, as you know, Denis
ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. But I'd just say, first, the narrative that in some way,
shape or form this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, I think, is an oversimplification. As
transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community, the amount of activity that'll come out of the
syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully. We're very well positioned for that. We are one of the
largest players in that, and that area is operating at its cyclical lows at the moment. But that's going to continue to
be a very, very important part of capital formation and it's not going away.
The growth in private credit will continue. I think we're very well positioned for that. We have about $130 billion of
private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. I've said publicly we have aspirations to continue
to invest and grow, and we see a number of places where we can do that. We're very focused on that. I do think
it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. And so while there are lots
of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will
respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle is a little bit unclear at the
moment.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2024
But I think strategically we're in a very, very interesting position, because we have the ability to marry for our
clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. And you can see that.
I mean, I can point to a transaction that we've done in the last few months where we did just that. And in fact it
wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too. You can look at the Endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability
to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender, but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for
our investors as an example of a way that I think our franchise and our platform is differentiated. Denis, do you
want to add anything to those comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I think it's well covered. I mean, I think there's been a lot of discussion over the past year of sort of private
credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is the syndicated alternative didn't really exist, and so it was
really just a discussion around private credit. With first quarter activity levels, you now see a viable functioning
and healthy syndicated loan market. The vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing. A lot of that
refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures, with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-
based syndicated market. So, the reality is these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers.
And over time, I think there will be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly
lent solutions, in some cases existing in the same capital structure. And I think we're just in a healthier
environment, but from Goldman Sachs's perspective is positive, because the data points that we now see across
the leveraged lending market make sponsor-estimated weighted average cost of capital much more observable,
and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some
incremental sponsor-related change in control activity. So, I think the sort of two markets functioning side by side
is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Really helpful color. And for my follow-up, just on capital management, CET1 continues to build. You're well in
excess of the regulatory minimums. The direction of travel in Basel III, in terms of expectations around the
proposal is certainly more favorable. At the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the
SLR, which declined to 5.4%. I know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but was hoping you could
speak to how you're managing through leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment
and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Steven. So, you're right on all counts. Obviously we have a variety of both capital and
liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. The SLR is a slow moving ratio, as you know, but our bindingness
can move back and forth between various ratios over time, and we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with
respect to our activities to manage that. But I appreciate the question.

years, this has been a pretty consistent story. So, if we kind of move aside financing, love to maybe just drill down
on some of the individual products that are accelerating in equities and FICC and where you're most pleased with
the execution that has occurred over the last several years? And then, you're still where you see the biggest room
to close any gaps that are maybe still there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
At a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and I think we got right over a period of time, you
know, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in these business. The top 150
clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise. And so, your share with them and
managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. I think the thing that we've done well and
that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos, and the
ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we
might have been a decade ago. And so it's something we're very focused on.
There are times where there is more activity in commodities, there's times when there's more activity in credit,
there's times when there's more activity in mortgages. It moves and it ebbs and flows. But what we're really trying
to do is make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way. And we've made real
progress in that over the course of the last couple of years.
I think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, I think we stand
at slightly under top 3 with 117 of them. Don't hold me to that number because that is probably 117 – okay, 117 of
them. So obviously we have progress to make, because there's no reason why Goldman Sachs shouldn't be top 3
with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. And also when you look at top 3, there are also
clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be first or second. So we continue to drill down, we continue
to go talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them, and that
discipline and that rigor I think is helping us execute for them. But there's more work to do, and we don't take our
position for granted. We try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver
and execute for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Yeah, okay. Great. Thanks, David. Maybe a quick follow-up here for Denis. Just on the equity investments line,
not a great quarter there. Not a drag either. Feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal
quarter without big puts and takes. And so, just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a
more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? And then how the private portfolio is positioned
if we are moving into a better exit environment? Obviously it's been tough there as well. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks for the question. So, a couple of things. And it may have been embedded in your question, but
obviously looking at some of the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis, just a reminder that
in Q4 when we sold Personal Financial Management, that was reflected as a gain in equity investments, about
$350 million. That did not repeat. So that will give you some insight into how that's trending sequentially. On a
year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio sort of in line with what you're suggesting
we might expect. But we did see a particular markdown in public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate
equity investment results. We also, as you know, have focused on selling down portion of our historical principal

investments. So, a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what
the market conditions are will obviously contribute to the ultimate performance.
The other guidance that we have put out there generally medium-term guidance is that across both equity and
debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year, so you put that in a quarter, about
$500 million. Those are some pieces of color I'd give you.

Good morning. Actually just a follow-up on the last question and comment. The run-off of the historical principal
investment from the $15 billion here, the $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the run-off that you expect, or
was that alluding to the revenues per year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks. Let me clarify. I was making a comment with respect to revenue, and then, separately as it relates
to the rundown of that portfolio, I guess the way to think of it picking up questions from last earnings and/or this
one, the progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for
the pace over the course of this year and then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all
of it in line with our target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. So $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
On the historical principal investment portfolio, yeah, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion
per quarter for the balance of the year.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your financing business in markets. And obviously
there's uncertainty about the Basel Endgame proposal, as you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it
to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. But one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other
jurisdictions is in securities financing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. And if that part of the proposal isn't
materially altered and it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your
financing revenues? Is it a threat? Is it not a big deal? Can you offset it through pricing and product design? Just
curious if you can provide a little color on that.

Sure. So obviously where Basel III ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how
they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. But I would say the breadth of
our financing activities across both FICC and equity are much broader than that particular component, and we
expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both FICC and equities will remain high.
We have leading market shares and capabilities there. So we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. And
depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need either to
pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on [indiscernible] (00:53:48) and the implications
of it being soft. And, Denis, you mentioned more flexibility on capital deployment given the direction of travel in
Basel. I mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? You did $1.5 billion. Do you feel like
there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I appreciate the question that we were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility
that we expected. But also pick up on something that David said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very
committed to our capital deployment hierarchy, which starts with our client franchise. And some of the activities
where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. And so, we have a good amount of
cushion and flexibility at this point in time. And as our clients become more active, the first place that we're going
to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. And after that, we would of course as you
note continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend and only after that would we think about return
of capital.
