Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, we are pleased to share our first quarter results.
Earnings per share were $0.52. Earnings per share were positively impacted by our reserve release. Brendon will
fill you in on all the details. But despite the release, our earnings would have exceeded consensus estimates.

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision are up 18% year-over-year as a result of the implementation of the ONB Way.
Adjusted operating leverage also improved over 900 basis points, and our efficiency ratio was 54.3%.
Other highlights for the quarter include, in the period, commercial loans excluding PPP increased 2.6%
annualized because of record first quarter commercial production of $718 million. End-of-period total deposits
increased more than $800 million which was 19% higher on an annualized basis and our loan-to-deposit ratio is
now a very low 78%.
Net interest income dollars were relatively unchanged consistent with our guidance. Wealth management assets
under management grew nicely. Mortgage revenue was seasonally stronger than expected and all expense
categories were slightly better than we had planned.
During the quarter, we worked hard with our clients on the SBA forgiveness process for round one PPP loans and
originating new round two loans. Our team helped the SBA fund almost 10,000 loans in the first round. 75% of
those applications have been forgiven by the SBA already. Our focus on the forgiveness process had allowed our
clients to achieve forgiveness faster than most. I'm also proud of the work we have done to support the second
round. We have processed almost 6,000 applications totaling $578 million with an average loan size of 98,000.
Most of our credit quality metrics improved during the quarter. With consistently better than economic forecast
and the massive stimulus programs, we reduced reserves consistent with our modeling. We still have
approximately 30% of our reserves supported by qualitative adjustments given the higher-than-average level of
economic uncertainty that exists today. We continue to proactively downgrade our pandemic-impacted loans in
the [ph] watch (00:03:24) asset quality ratings and are still meeting weekly to review credit quality loan by loan.
We continue to believe that our historically strong and consistent underwriting practices, diverse and greater loan
portfolios and Midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better than most.
A quick update on hiring. We have added some excellent candidates during the quarter and we continue to have
a good pipeline of opportunities. We have a fantastic story to tell and we have strong interest from people wanting
to join our team.
Lastly, despite the ongoing distractions, we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities and I
think our results are indicative of our efforts.
I'll now turn the call over to Brendon.

Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 4. Both our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were $0.52. Adjusted
earnings exclude $1.5 million in ONB Way related charges as well as $2 million in debt securities gains.
Moving to slide 5. We are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue which was 18%
higher year-over-year. And despite the challenging operating environment we generated 919 basis points of
positive operating leverage.
Slide 6 shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix. Total average loans excluding PPP grew
$180 million or 3.7%. End of period commercial loans increased $59 million driven by record first quarter
commercial production of $780 million. Commercial activity remained strong throughout our footprint with
production well-balanced among our major markets. Commercial production yields increased quarter-over-quarter
3

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
to 2.89%, 75% of which were floating rate. Even with our seasonally strong production, our quarter end pipeline
increased 28% over prior quarter to $2.6 billion. We believe the current pipeline with over $600 million in the [ph]
accepted (00:05:20) category should lead to another strong quarter of production. The investment portfolio also
increased in the quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced loan growth. We are taking a disciplined
approach to putting excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio with new money yields of 1.35% and a
portfolio duration well within five years.
Moving to slide 7. Period-end and average deposits increased during the quarter by 90% and 13% respectively.
This growth has largely come from higher business and personal savings rates that have resulted from changing
spending patterns and added liquidity from the various government stimulus actions during the quarter.
Turning to pricing. Our total cost of deposits was 7 basis points for the quarter, a 2-basis-point-improvement over
Q4. In our continuing efforts to drive funding costs lower, we also reduced average borrowings this quarter by
$181 million.
Next on slide 8, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Net interest income declined $30
million quarter-over-quarter largely due to the decrease of $10 million in PPP-related interest and fees. Excluding
the impact of PPP, net income was in line with our expectations with a slight $3 million decline predominately due
to fewer days in the quarter. Net interest margin declined 32 basis points this quarter to 2.94% due to lower PPP
fees, fewer days and additional excess cash. For margin excluding accretion and PPP, fell 40 basis points to
2.74%. Excess cash and fewer days accounted for 8 basis points of the decline with the remainder due to new
business rates on loans and investments.
Slide 9 still trends in adjusted non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income of $55 million in the first quarter
was slightly lower than the $58 million we've recorded in Q4. The $3 million decline was primarily driven by lower
capital markets income. Mortgage revenues were better than expected with unseasonably strong first quarter
production of $518 million and elevated gain on sale margins. We also saw a nice growth in our wealth segment
due to increases in assets under management and progress in our ONB Way-related initiatives.
Next, slide 10, shows a trend in adjusted non-interest expenses. Adjusting for ONB Way-related charges and tax
credit amortization, non-interest expense was $115 million. These results are slightly better than what we outlined
in our fourth quarter call and they included $1.3 million reversal, a provision for unfunded commitments, which
runs through the other expense category. We do not anticipate additional material reductions in our unfunded
reserve in the near-term.
Included in our total expenses in Q1 were $1.5 million in charges related to ONB Way strategic plan. We have just
completed the migration of our data center to an offset location. Costs related to this migration will be reported in
Q2 earnings and should be immaterial. The second quarter charges should be the last of the ONB Way related
cost to impact earnings.
Turning to PPP loans on slide 11, you will see a record of those balances which stood at $1.1 billion at quarter
end. We continue to assist Round 1 clients with forgiveness with approximately 75% formally through the SBA
forgiveness process. We have seen stronger demand in Round 2 than we anticipated, having originated just
under $500 million through March 31.
As of late last week, Round 2 applications totaled $578 million with corresponding fees totaling approximately $26
million. This brings the total unamortized fees on PPP loans from Rounds 1 and 2 to $33 million. We would
4

anticipate most Round 2 loans to be forgiven and the corresponding recognition of the fee income to occur late in
2021.
With that, I will turn it over to Daryl to discuss credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Brendon. Slide 12 reflects the performance of our loan portfolio both on the current quarter and
historical trend basis. Total 30-plus day delinquencies continued their downward trend for the third consecutive
quarter following the 12 basis points at the most recent quarter's end. As our commercial delinquencies have
historically been on the low side, the improvement we have seen over the past several quarters had been
concentrated in the retail portfolio.
Stimulus payments, higher levels of discretionary funds, as a result of reduced spending during the pandemic and
seasonal income tax refunds, are all likely contributing factors to the historically low retail delinquency rates. We
will have to see what subsequent quarters may bring on the delinquency front, but the current level is, in all
likelihood, unsustainable in the long-term. Net charge-offs were well-contained with a very small net recovery
posted in the quarter. The lack of charge-offs has certainly been a very pleasant surprise given where we feared
we might be back in March of last year.
Over the past several quarters, we have been of the mind that charge-offs associated with pandemic would be
pushed out to the first and second quarter of this year. At this point in time, we are not seeing a strong potential
for significant charge-offs in the portfolio, although they certainly could occur if we get a setback in the progress
we are making on the pandemic front or the economy stalls for some reason.
Non-performing loans fell slightly in the quarter with both non-accrual and restructured loans reflecting modest
decreases in the period. As you can see, the gap between Old National and its peers in this particular metric has
favorably narrowed over the last several years.
We continue to perform well in the net charge-offs to non-performing loan category. As you can see over the past
three years, our peers' results have ranged from roughly 21% to 28%, while we have reflected results in the 1% to
4% range. With the net recovery results in the current quarter, we're off to a good start in this category for 2021.
The combination of swift vaccine rollout and generous government stimulus programs have certainly led to a
more rapid economic recovery than many of us could have imagined 12 months ago. I believe we all
acknowledge and understand how fortunate we are to have escaped a longer and more severe economic
downturn than we experienced.
However, in our opinion, we need to take this opportunity to step back and see how we might change approaches
to forward views of risk identification management. I think the industry does a relatively good job of understanding
credit risk based on historical performance, but many of us had to scramble back in March of last year to try to
figure out how an unprecedented event like a pandemic was going to impact our loan portfolios going forward.
In retrospect, we were able to get the job done. But the way we accomplish this was not as efficient or as
specifically forward risk-oriented as we might have wished. We have ongoing efforts in the bank attentive on
learning from this experience and intend to take steps even in the near term to make ourselves better on this
front.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brendon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Daryl. On slide 13, you will see the details of our first quarter allowance of $114 million, which is a
decline of $70 million from Q4. The improving economic outlook, including the impact of a successful vaccine
rollout and most recent government stimulus, led to an $11 million decrease in reserve needs. The improving
underlying quality of our loan portfolio led to an additional $7 million reduction. As you recall, we were measured
in our approach the reserve build at the onset of this crisis and will be similarly thoughtful if the economy
improves.
And although the economy is clearly strengthening, there remains an above-average amount of uncertainty. As a
result, we are holding larger amount of qualitative reserve today than as typical and we will continue to closely
monitor our portfolio performance and make the appropriate adjustments to our reserves in future quarters.
I would also like to remind you that we continue to carry $46 million in unamortized market from our acquired
portfolios. And while these markets will not directly offset charge-offs, any remaining market will increase through
margin upon resolution.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We were very pleased with the fundamental results of
the quarter. Record first quarter commercial production and earnings asset growth helped us deliver on the stable
net interest income we guided through last quarter. Our fee businesses, particularly mortgage and wealth,
continued to perform well and our credit quality metrics continue to exceed expectations.
Slide 14 includes thoughts on our outlook for 2021. We ended the quarter with a healthy $2.6 billion commercial
pipeline, which included $623 million in the accepted category. Lower new businesses – lower new business and
reinvestment rates will continue to put pressure on net interest margin, but we expect net interest income to
remain stable through continued earning asset growth. The PPP loan forgiveness process continues for our
Round 1 clients and Round 2 production is going well. We expect runoff of Round 2 balances to occur in the latter
half of 2021 and the recognition of most of the related $26 million in amortized fees to occur at that time. We
expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well. We were encouraged by the momentum in our mortgage
and wealth businesses but performance will be subject to industry trends. A strong commercial activity and rate
environment should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business. Deposit service
charges continue to lag historical levels with the receipt of additional stimulus further delaying the return of this
revenue line to pre-pandemic levels.
Other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term. Expenses should increase in 2Q with their annual merit
increases that were effective in early April. And we do not anticipate any additional material recapture and the
reserve for unfunded commitments. We are generally comfortable with the current consensus estimates on
expenses for the remainder of the year.
Lastly, a brief update on taxes. We continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we
work through the last of the remaining one year historical tax credit commitments. In total, we are expecting
approximately $5 million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of
approximately 20%.
With that we're happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including
Jim Sandgren.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Scott, you're back.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. I know. You remembered. Didn't need a repeat of last quarter. But I appreciate
[indiscernible] (00:15:25). So, hey, good morning. I hope you guys are doing well and appreciate the question –
you taking the question. Maybe first place to start off is just on the nuance of the margin. The core margin ex
PAAs and PPP down to about [ph] $274 million (00:15:43) maybe thoughts on what's going on there? And I
guess, more importantly, order of magnitude of further pressure just as you see it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes, Scott. This is Brendon. Yeah, I think it's difficult for us to pinpoint where the margin is headed. Obviously, the
excess liquidity in the system is putting pressure on margins. But our focus has been and will continue to be
maintaining the interest income stable. We think we have the earning asset growth potential to do that. And that's
where we'll be focused.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. And then just on the lending side, I mean you guys are really bucking the trend by
showing any growth on the commercial side, which is good. Guess I'm curious, Jim, to hear your thoughts on
competition and the dynamic there. Now that we're more successfully reopening, broadly speaking, are your
competitors doing the same thing or is it still an environment where you, guys, are just really well-positioned to
continue to take market share particularly in some of your newer markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes, Scott. Jim Sandgren here. Yeah, we continue to be really opportunistic. I think as we've shared in the past
calls, we've been out; we're out calling. Our leadership team has been out in the markets the last few months.
And if new clients and prospects are willing to see us, we're out making calls. So really liked the frame of mind. I
will tell you that competition is certainly starting to heat up particularly on the commercial real estate side. We're
seeing some great compression there. Also extended interest only periods on construction deals. We're seeing
longer term fixed rates without swaps and without prepayment penalties.
Again, we're maintaining discipline and we're still winning. And so, to see the growth that we had in the first
quarter with commercial line utilization down and we're starting to see the secondary market refinancing start
picking up. But again, I think our frame of mind has been very opportunistic and we've been out calling, and I think
other banks are starting to certainly pick up. So, competition is fierce, but I like our chances. We, obviously, built
7

the pipeline up quite a bit in the quarter. We finished the first quarter really strong from the production and feel
good about second quarter as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Scott, this is Jim. I would also add that, I think, you're starting to see the fruits of all of our efforts regarding new
hires start to impact us here. And I can think of – we were just in Wisconsin and we've got some great new hires
in Wisconsin that are really starting to get some traction at C&I space.
And as we continue to fill out the key markets, new hires, I think we'll continue to have opportunities to grow
particularly as their non-competes wear off, and they can be active calling on their former clients in the
marketplace. So, this is in a way we're driving new businesses. We've got incredibly focused effort. Jim and I are
out calling regularly and we're hiring new people to help augment some markets and some product classes we
continue to want to grow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
A quick question. This last quarter, just looking at the releases, you kind of shifted from the allowance per loan
losses to the allowance per credit losses. And I'm just wondering, do you have a reserve against securities or
unfunded loan commitments just because the fourth quarter matches up with what was disclosed today? And then
could you just repeat again what the unfunded loan commitment expense was in the first quarter and maybe what
that was last year?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, Terry, the allowance for unfunded commitments is related to credit losses and, obviously, associated with any
of those unfunded construction draws or revolvers and we've had that on the books for some time. We ended the
quarter $1.3 million lower than we did last quarter and that really runs through our CECL models, and the same
drivers that drive our allowance for credit losses are the drivers that drive our allowance for employment
payments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. And then, Jim, just the last page of the investor deck, your 20 peer banks, I just
noticed two announced an MOE last week, another one included in a deal this morning. I guess my question does
what does that say about mid-sized banks, and what does that say for Old National?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I think it continues to be a difficult environment out there, right? I mean, the operating environment is not
getting any easier. There's lots of competition. There's lots of need to continue to invest in talent and technology.
And I think revenue growth can be challenging for our industry. So I think all those things are driving those types
of conversations.
As I have said previously, we're open to all those kinds, any kind of transaction that will ultimately drive
stakeholder value and we'll just have to think – But anything in the MOE space, I think, requires a higher bar,
right, and you got to be really focused on culture, strategy and fit in addition to the financials because if you can't
get those things right, then the financials won't come; so obviously open. Anything that makes sense, our board of
directors would have to take a look at those things, but a slightly higher bar.

Hey, guys. Good morning. Jim, maybe a question on capital. You talked about the growth – the movers and the
drivers of the growth this quarter. Can you speak to your appetite for buybacks? Obviously, I heard the comments

Old National Bancorp

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
about a little bit cautious on the uncertainty with the economy, but you guys have a ton of capital. I'm just
interested in buyback priority.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Definitely on the table for us to consider, and we're going to balance those out with near-term outlook on
any potential M&A partnerships, and we'll just go for the trade-off. Clearly, as the economy gets a more stable
footing, we get more comfortable. I think they become more of a viable option. But again, I think we'll want to look
at how we can better deploy capital, what's the better use of capital, a buyback or an M&A partnership
opportunity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But I guess I shouldn't read into the lack of a buyback, meaning proximity to a deal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. That's been our stance the entire year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just on the reserve. Obviously, your credit has been spectacular over cycles. How do we
think about just the absolute level of reserve today versus maybe fast forward a year when we fully emerge? Can
you just remind us where the day one was and how you're thinking about that bogey?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Chris, this is Brendon. Yeah. So we started day one season with $96 million. We're at $114 million today. A
big chunk of that difference in our model today is the qualitative reserve, which we're holding significantly more
than we did at day 1, just reflecting the uncertainty of the economy. So that is that comparison. That said, we're
not sure what the economy would look like three quarters from now. We're comfortable with where the reserve
stands today, and we'll be flexible and move it up or down accordingly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then if I could just sneak one other clarifying comment. The NII stability, was that excluding both PPP
accretion or was that a GAAP number?

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning. A question for you, Brendon, just on the expense guide to clarify that. I see a
consensus of about $485 million for the year. Is that the number you're looking at or should we be looking at
something else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I'm thinking, Jon, that the second, third and fourth quarter numbers are reflective of our expectations. So
give ourselves credit for the $3 million fee relative to what the Street had. But, yeah, rough and tough, that's pretty
close.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Back on loan growth, any differences in recovery expectations across the footprint? And if you had to put your
finger on what is really driving the full optimism, what would that be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I'm going to start this off, Jon, and then let Jim jump in. Clearly, I think we've demonstrated our willingness to be
out seeing clients looking for opportunities. And it was all driven by the comfort around our credit quality and our
portfolios, right? We came in. We're known to be that relatively conservative lender. So we came in feeling pretty
11


Old National Bancorp
(ONB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
good about our portfolios. We were quickly able to jump in and analyze the portfolios and confirm that we should
continue to feel good about that.
So it didn't stop us where many of our peers took a pause there. They took a pause for a couple of different
reasons. They took a pause because I think they were worried about their own portfolios. But they also took a
pause because they had people at home, maybe not as proactive as our team members were. And so we
continue to do that.
Places like Michigan continue to have setbacks in terms of their COVID numbers. So that will probably put maybe
a little bit of pressure at least on the psyche of some of those people up there, and so we'll continue to watch that.
But I don't see a big change in our markets. This is still a Midwest-focused organization and they all seem to be
recovering on equal basis. But I do think it will – various competitors will come back in various ways. And as Jim
said, we've seen it most acutely on the commercial real estate sector where that seem to come back in a pretty
significant way, but we'll continue to be active.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. The only thing I would add, our clients and prospects we're talking to certainly in the manufacturing space,
some on the [ph] contract and spending (00:26:17) – very, very optimistic. And the biggest challenge across the
footprint is just finding skilled labor. And that's the big thing that's holding people back. And there's been some
supply chain challenges as well. But overall, I mean, it's really an optimistic outlook and they continue to deal with
those other challenges fairly well; so, optimistic.

Okay. Good. Just two more follow-ups. Slide 12, the credit slide. The nonperforming loans, they're coming down
and they're gradually coming down. And I'm just curious, if you could share with us the profile of what is NPLs and
maybe the flows in and out in terms of what you're seeing there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Jon. Let me start by saying what's interesting in this environment is there are still, what I would consider
maybe probably smaller banks than Old National that are really aggressive in taking some of these clients. And
so, through any cycle, that has a big influence on our ability to manage non-performers or move non-performers
out. These kind of liquidity in the market, who's taking these loans. So, we never – I think maybe for a quarter,
maybe two quarters, that slowed down a little bit. But really, not like [indiscernible] (00:27:38). So that's the first
ability for us to manage those.
On the nonperforming, we had a little less than $10 million in actual paydowns out of that portfolio. So again, to
the extent that they're able to find other banks that are doing that. The profile on our non-performers is really
across the board. We really don't have any industries that are concentrated in any of that. Really no C&I versus
CRE. It is just individual borrowers throughout that many different industries that have come on this list. And I
think as to Jim's comment earlier, it's just the way we've underwritten coming into the cycle.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2021
And Jon, you know our history here right? Where we tend to call them very early. And I think, if you look into the
graph to the right, in terms of what our charge-off looks like relative that portfolio, because we're early to call them
and really decide whether this is a credit that we think we can stick with or this is a credit that we think we need to
work out. I think that gives us an advantage when it comes to the actual loss of experience that we have with
those individual borrowers.
And quite often, we're able to rehabilitate them and they go back in the book and we recapture that interest
income that we didn't take all the time they were in that bucket. But I think it's just being proactive with those
situations and trying to get as accurately as possible when we see weakness.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's interesting you look at that chart in the upper right. On slide 12, and when we look at it every quarter but
when you really look at it, it's – you're right on that; it's impressive. And then, I guess the last thing, Chris and
Terry asked around it as well. But what is your appetite on M&A, excluding the MOE piece of it because I agree
that's a rifle shot and sticky situations on a lot of that. But what is your appetite and what are you seeing in terms
of deal flow and attractiveness of potential sellers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, consistent with my previous comments on the quarter, we're not seeing a lot of books being passed around
and those smaller opportunities. And our appetite, I think, is back. 2019 we were internally focused. 2020 was the
year of the pandemic and executing our ONB Way. And I think now we're in a position particularly as we get more
comfortable with credit that we could be in a position. And it doesn't mean that I wasn't active over those two year
period of time. I can tell you I was very active. I still continue to do that, a lot of that personally. And so absolutely
are in a position to – if one comes along that's attractive, that meets all of our hurdle rates, we would absolutely
take a look at it in this kind of environment particularly given our better ability to assess credit risk.

Ben T. Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Solid quarter, good start to the year. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more
hypothetically on credit. Now, if you look over the past couple of recessions, you see net charge-offs peaked in
and a bit of a bell curve manner about two or three quarters after the bottom from like a GDP perspective, I guess
you could say. So, this recession and recovery a bit different, obviously, because a lot of the stimulus and
government programs intervening, preventing a lot of aspects through deferrals. So just thinking hypothetically,
it's probably going to be a bit of a bell curve but elongated and less of a peak at the top, so as you guys work

through this year and your qualitative factors comes holding it back. Do you need to see continued improvement
or there's more time passing by before you feel more comfortable with that total allowance working back down to
the below $90 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Ben, I think you characterized it really well. I do think this recession is different. Probably it could be elongated,
maybe a lower peak. And I think the time is what's going to tell that story. And then in opening comments, we're
going to be thoughtful about our approach to reserving over the course of the year given the uncertainty. I think
your comments were appropriate in how we're thinking about it as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben T. Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Okay. Thanks. And then just thinking about loan growth in general. A lot of the bigger banks you guys all alluded
pulled back, and then most recently come back into the quarter. And some of the commentary at least from last
week on the really big regional banks that seen as the second half of the year is going to be the area where you
see actual growth being that you guys have seen core loan growth late last year and early this year. Do you feel
as though that the competitive aspects are to prevent you from going at the pace that you were or is the markets
going to be recovering?
Like I'm just trying to figure out [indiscernible] (00:32:49) core loan growth, is it a driver of you taking share or you
just knowing your customer because you are competing for slightly smaller customers? Or from a more nuanced
dynamic, is there areas within lending, whether it be C&I or CRE, that you feel as though you can [indiscernible]
(00:33:10) while the other people are still on the sidelines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I would just add a little bit of both, right? I mean we are taking share. We're taking share because we're just
a little bit more nimble, a little bit more focused. We're taking share because we're hiring new people. And then we
know our customers pretty darn well customers pretty darn well. And we're out making sure that we're meeting
their needs and their demands and working with them and looking forward, it's really hard obviously. That's why
we tried to provide the pipeline perspective. It's really hard to look out two or three or four quarters out in terms of
what growth might translate. We feel really good about, obviously we gave our pipeline numbers for the quarter in
the accepted category.
That gives us more comfort. It's hard to know how competition ultimately going to change those pipeline numbers.
But what I will tell you this, it won't stop our focus, I won't stop our efforts. We're going to outhustle everybody
around us. We're going to work really hard. We'll continue to put attractive people on the team to go out and grow
this business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben T. Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
And then finally, my last question kind of looks at more of the fee income. Obviously, mortgage is a bit out of your
control given the national dynamics of it. But are there any areas where you continue to see some outsized
growth. I know that wealth management had a good quarter. Service charges were downloaded but that's
probably a day count factor. Any areas within fee income where you've been adding some talent that maybe the
market isn't looking at it correctly?

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, I'm just saying the wealth management basis in the area we continue to grow and look for talent, and
fundamentally, we're changing our approach to that business. We're really focused on holistic financial planning
and less focused on individual transactions to grow revenue. And so I think those are probably as we've always
said a little longer term play they don't translate into results. But I think the quarter you're starting to see both we
benefited from obviously a better market by and large. But also continuing to hire people in that space, continue to
have a focus on that space.
I've never felt better about that business than I do today for us to continue to drive better than our historic run
growth profile. I think Treasury management an area to that we're also investing a lot in in terms of people and
technology. We feel really good about that business. Again, that's a little longer playing. It's not as big an impact
in the short run, but over the long-term, I feel better about our ability to grow that business.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Hey. Just – I don't want to make it put too fine a point on the PPP outlook, but so most of what you've
got left in fees is Round 2. Just as we think about the cadence of things, when most of the Round 1 forgiveness
fees, does that come in the second quarter? And then, how are you thinking about the Round 2 forgiveness in the
second half of the year? Is that going to be lumpier and geared toward the fourth quarter or evenly split through
the two quarters in the second half of the year?
And then, at this point, would you say – I mean, we're pretty much done with originations in Round 2. In other
words, what we see is what we get, and this is good days to go off of?

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. I would say, a vast majority of the originations that we quoted. Brendon gave you the first quarter through the
fourth quarter. And then, I quoted year-to-date, the $578 million. That's more than likely the bulk of what we're
going to be doing for the year given the programs likely to run out of funds here very soon. That's probably loaded
towards the fourth quarter, that Round 2 number is probably loaded towards the fourth quarter. And let's just say
90% of that number probably is collected this year. It's really hard to put a finer point on it than that.

Thank you so much. We appreciate your participation. One thing that I want to make sure we pointed you

ability to tell that story. So, hopefully, you had a chance to take a look at that report.
We think it's indicative of all of our hard work and energy. In addition to the commercial and all the other things
