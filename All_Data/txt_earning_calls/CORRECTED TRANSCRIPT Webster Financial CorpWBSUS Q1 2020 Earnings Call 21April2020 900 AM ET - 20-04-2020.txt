Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Webster's first quarter earnings call. We have
modified call this morning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. CFO Glenn MacInnes and I will review business
and financial performance for the quarter. I will also provide some additional information on the line of business
performance and COVID-19 related activities across the bank. After Glenn and I complete our prepared remarks,
I will review our credit profile including one, our exposure to industry's most directly impacted by the pandemic.
Two, a comparison of our current portfolio with the portfolio we had heading into the 2008 financial crisis, and
three, a portfolio by portfolio review of key credit metrics and industry exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer, Jason
Soto will join me during this portion of the presentation. After the credit discussion, HSA Bank President, Chad
Wilkins and Jason will both join me and Glenn in responding to your questions.
First, I want to acknowledge the fact that we are living in uncertain, challenging and unprecedented times. I hope
that all of you and your loved ones are healthy and safe, and I want to let those whose health has been impacted
by the crisis, know that the Webster Bank family has you in our thoughts. The way our bankers have taken care of
each other, our customers and communities over the last two months is truly amazing. I usually end my remarks
with thanks to our bankers, but today, I'm going to start by thanking each and every Webster banker for their
remarkable contributions during this challenging time. I'm so proud of the entire Webster team.
Webster Bank and the entire banking industry has rallied to be part of the solution to this health crisis and the
resulting economic fallout. I also want to publicly acknowledge the bold, swift and timely actions of legislators,
bank regulators, the treasury and state and local officials, each have collectively and individually reached out to
banks, listened to what's happening on the ground and rolled out creative and impactful programs to help those
individuals and businesses in need.

When you turn to slide 2, you can see Webster at its very best. Consistent with the way our values based
organization has operated since our founding during the Great Depression in 1935, we immediately took action at
the outset of the pandemic to support our employees, customers and the communities we serve. The safety of our
employees was and is our number one priority. We swiftly moved 80% of our workforce to remote or at home
work, thereby creating a safer, socially distance work setup in our buildings for those who need to be on site to
execute the central operations. We modified branch activities and hours to ensure the safety of our employees
and customers while being available to meet to our customer's needs.
This included moving to drive through and ATM service with bank lobbies open by appointment only. We
established a no interest loan program for our employees whose families have been financially impacted by the
pandemic. We've paid all of our employees 100% of pay including those who are home because of illness,
quarantine, higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids' home because of school closures. We've
increased the daily pay of those bankers on the frontline and have added PTO time to those workers as a future
benefit. We have not reduced our workforce by a single FTE during the crisis and we've augmented and
expanded our employee assistance programs to support our employees during the pandemic.
For our customers, just as we lead the banking industry with our foreclosure avoidance program during the Great
Recession, we immediately placed a moratorium on residential mortgage foreclosures relating to Webster owned
mortgages. We waived fees on early CD withdrawals, we increased the availability and amount of funds for
withdrawal by our customers and we work with our customers adversely impacted by COVID-19 through the
modification of loans, the deferral of loan payments and through participation in the SBA Paycheck Protection
Program and the Fed's Main Street Lending Program.
Here are some data points related to activities we've undertaken, both as principle and what we've done through
government programs. As of April 16th, we have modified over 2,000 units representing $476 million of residential
mortgages and home equities. That's approximately 6.5% of total home equity and mortgage balances, roughly
750 borrowers or $300 million of small business loans representing approximately 17% of our small business
portfolio outstandings and over 300 borrowers and close to $1.6 billion of commercial loans or roughly 13% of the
funded commercial loan portfolio.
With respect to the Paycheck Protection Program, we started accepting applications on Day 1 and despite
technology and process challenges experienced by all banks, we were able to help many business clients in
need. When the SBA stopped accepting applications last Thursday, we had more than 2,000 SBA approved loans
representing approximately $650 million. Most of which should be funded over the next week. We've continued to
process applications internally and we'll begin submitting those applications for approval when the SBA has
additional funding and opens up the process, which it looks now like it will be later this week. With respect to the
Fed's Main Street Lending Program, we have worked with our industry organizations and directly with the Fed to
be prepared to utilize these loan programs to help our larger commercial customers through the crisis.
And four, our communities. We've increased the amount of our 2020 philanthropy budget and reposition dollars to
support those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We've made more than $375,000 in donations thus far
to Feeding America, The American Red Cross and United Ways across our footprint to provide urgent basic
needs.
I'll now turn to our financial highlights on slide 3. Web quarter results continue to demonstrate our ongoing
commitment to strong execution on strategic priorities through any and all operating environments. Pre-provision
net revenue of $125 million was up modestly from Q4 driven by a slight increase in total revenue and a slight
decline in expenses. Earnings per share were $0.39 in the quarter compared to $0.96 in Q4 of 2019 and $1.06 in

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
the prior year's first quarter. The decline resulted primarily from an increased provision resulting from the adoption
of CECL, a weakening forward economic outlook and the impact of a significantly lower interest rate environment.
Glenn and I will walk you through the assumptions underlying our CECL process and ultimate provision number.
Our CECL process is strong, consistent with the requirements and controls of the accounting process. In this
quarter, that process included the appropriate amount of conservatism and thoughtful judgment to reflect the
uncertainty of the environment and the behaviors in our portfolio with respect to onset of the pandemic. Tangible
book value per common share increased 8% from prior year. Our first quarter return on common equity was
4.75% and return on tangible common equity was 5.95% with each reflecting the $68 million reserve build in the
quarter. A combination of a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decrease in expenses led to improvement
in the efficiency ratio, which was 58% in Q1. March 31st reported credit metrics remained strong, while our
forward forecast of economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the onset of the pandemic.
Slide 4 presents loan and deposit trends. Loan growth was strong as total loans grew 11% and commercial loans
grew almost 16% from a year ago or by more than $1.8 billion. Strong organic growth increase was augmented by
approximately $450 million in revolver drawdowns in the commercial portfolio in March, and we saw a reduction in
prepayment activity. Deposits grew 7.7% year-over-year driven by the inflow of HSA deposits and public funds
and transactional and HSA deposits now represent 60% of total deposits up from 57% a year ago. Also, of note,
footings at HSA Bank increased 9% from a year ago, for growth of $679 million during the year.
Turning to slide 5, I will spend a few minutes speaking to each of our three lines of business. In Commercial
Banking, loans were up nearly 7% linked quarter and 15.5% from a year ago, which includes the aforementioned
$450 million in net revolver draws. Pre-drilled, the year-over-year growth, while sponsor and specialty loan
balances, which saw the lion's share of the revolver draws, drove the linked quarter increase. Prepayments were
lower in the quarter, partially attributable to lower economic and transaction activity in the second half of the
quarter due to the emergence of the pandemic.
Deposits were up smartly some 15% linked quarter and 20% from a year ago, largely driven by the depositing of
revolver draws into DDA. Normalizing for revolver usage, deposits were up approximately 5% in Commercial
Banking in the quarter. Loan and deposit volumes in the quarter grew over 3% year-over-year increase to net
interest income in Commercial Banking despite rate pressure. Expenses were up 4.3% year-over-year, driven by
investment in people and technology. Commercial Banking PPNR was relatively flat year-over-year. While we are
appropriately cautious with new underwriting activities, I can tell you that we closed meaningful high quality new
business in the quarter, in segments that are not experiencing a material adverse impact from the pandemic,
segments such as software and technology infrastructure. In fact, in early April, we closed our largest agency deal
on a best efforts basis, a $350 million technology infrastructure deal where we held just over 10% of the risk after
close.
Turning to slide 6. In HSA Bank, we are continuing to make great progress. We concluded another successful first
quarter as we opened 338,000 new accounts for a total of 734,000 new accounts opened over the last 12 months.
In addition, we added over 1,000 new employers in the quarter. There was no material impact in the quarter
related to the previously reported movement of accounts tied to the decision by two wholesale partners, custodial
partners to insource account administration. And the accounts were up 6.4% to $3.1 million, while deposits
increased 8.5% to $6.7 billion. The 2019 year-end revenue report indicated an overall HSA market that slowed
marginally as the market growth rate of accounts was flat and the deposit growth rate declined by 3 percentage
points during the year.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
One important point to note is that HSA Banks funded account growth rate was 9.2% in 2019 compared to the
industry rate of 5.6%. In the first quarter, our funded account growth rate was 6.8% year-over-year, both reflective
of our consistently low percentage of unfunded accounts when compared to industry data. We had a good start to
the year from a sales perspective, as we signed several large employers in the quarter. We also announced a
major partnership with Jellyvision that will further enable our customers to make informed and smart healthcare
choices. We also launched partnerships with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Principal Financial Group.
These partnerships are all uniquely capable of delivering strong growth especially within the jumbo employer
market.
In addition, as you may have seen yesterday, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire State Farm
Banks portfolio of seasoned HSA accounts representing approximately $140 million in deposits. We expect to
close that transaction in the second quarter or third quarter. In response to the pandemic and consistent with all of
Webster, we were able to quickly transition 96% of our HSA staff to work from home in less than three weeks,
maintaining 24/7 customer support and continuing to meet service and quality metrics. In addition, we are working
closely to support our customers through the pandemic at a time when our services may be particularly critical
including capabilities, we have deployed directly or via partnerships such as eHealth, HSA, FSA Store, GoodRx,
Blink Health, Medical Cost Advocate and Healthcare Bluebook.
We feel with the current legislative and political landscape remains favorable for the HSA industry and the
chances of a near-term Medicare for all national healthcare solution are even more remote than they were a year
ago. Our relationship with WEX, our technology partner and Cigna, our largest HSA partner has never been
stronger.
I am on page 7, in Community Banking, we've done a tremendous job of keeping our employees and customers
safe while continuing to provide the standard of customer service our clients expect. Total community bank loans
grew by 5% year over year with Business Banking loans leading the way at 9%, deposits grew by 3% again led by
Business Banking. Non-interest income was up 9% as a result of higher mortgage and investment services
revenue. Many more customers have transitioned to self-service channels as digitally active households crossed
50% in the quarter for the first time and we see that trend continuing given the pandemic.
As you can imagine our Community Banking team along with the resources from across the bank are working
digitally – diligently in executing on the PPP Loan Program, which will help so many of our customers. We've
been focusing on customer outreach and support and I can't say enough about the way our community bankers
including all of those in our banking centers have delivered for our customers and communities during the first
quarter and over the last several weeks.
Before I turn over Glenn, I'd like to make a couple of comments related to capital management. First, we are
completely focused on internal execution and other than opportunistic HSA transactions, bank M&A remains a low
priority. We have a strong capital position enabling us to support our customers and assist in a financial recovery
in the country. As we announced this morning, our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.
Also after a modest repurchase of approximately 2 million shares in early Q1 before the onset of the pandemic,
we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until this pandemic is behind us.
I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Thanks, John. I'll begin with our average balance sheet on slide 8. Average loans grew $516 million or 2.6%
linked quarter. Growth was led primarily by the commercial business. A linked quarter increase of $329 million in
commercial real estate was the result of strong originations and a reduction in pay offs. On a year-over-year
basis, our commercial real estate loans grew more than $1 billion. Commercial loans now represent 66% of total
loans compared to 63% in prior year. Consumer loan performance was driven by a $96 million increase in
residential mortgages with some offset in home equity. On the deposit side, our low cost transactional and HSA
deposits have increased more than $1.2 billion from last year and now represents 60% of total deposits with a
combined [indiscernible] (00:17:30) basis points.
The Q1 seasonal inflow of HSA and government deposits-funded loan growth as well as a $200 million reduction
in short-term borrowings. With regard to capital, the modest average linked quarter reduction in common equity is
reflect of a Day 1 CECL adjustment of $58 million and approximately $77 million as a result of share repurchases
in the quarter. Likewise modest reductions in the common equity Tier 1 and tangible common equity ratios are
also reflective of CECL, share repurchases, and asset growth. We have elected to phase in the CECL impact on
regulatory capital, which favorably impacts our ratios by 20 to 25 basis points. Even excluding the phase and in
capital treatment, our capital ratios would remain very strong and well in excess of regulatory well-capitalized
levels.
Slide 9 summarizes our Q1 income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings. Net interest income was flat to
prior quarter as a $6 million benefit from loan growth was offset by the effect of a lower rate environment. This is
reflective in our net interest margin, which was lower by four basis points versus Q4, 16 basis points due to lower
lone yield, which was partially offset by 9 basis points from a lower deposit costs and 3 basis points from a lower
borrowing costs versus prior year net interest income declined $11 million, $31 million of the decline was due to
lower market rates with a partial loss set of $20 million from earning asset growth.
Non-interest income increased $2.5 million linked quarter and $4.8 million in prior year. HSA fee income
increased $3.4 million as a result of account growth and the seasonal increase in interchange. In addition our
mark-to-market on hedging activity increased $2.6 million, which was offset by decline in syndication and client
swap revenue. The increase in non-interest income from prior year reflects the mark-to-market on hedging activity
as well as higher mortgage banking revenue. Reported non-interest expense of $179 million declined modestly
linked quarter and grew less than 2% from prior year. Pre-provision net revenue of $125 million increased $3
million from Q4 and decreased $9 million from prior year. Provision for credit losses for the quarter was $76
million, which I will explain in more detail shortly. The efficiency ratio improved a 58% from 58.5% in Q4, reflecting
a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in non-interest expense. And our effective tax rate was
22.6% compared to 22.3% in Q4.
Turning to slide 10, I will review our results of our CECL adoption and the first quarter allowance. As we look at
the walk, the Day 1 CECL adoption was $58 million, a 28% increase in the allowance, resulting in a starting
coverage ratio of 1.33%. During the quarter, we had $7.8 million in net charge offs. We rerecorded a $12 million
provision as a result of loan growth of $855 million during the quarter. Loan growth primarily came from the
commercial categories and included $450 million in line draws in March, slower prepayment activity and loans
funded from our strong fourth quarter pipeline. The remaining Q1 provision was $64 million bringing our allowance
to $335 million or coverage of 1.6%. The provision is reflective of our economic outlook including GDP,
unemployment and housing prices and a qualitative assessment of our loan portfolio and how it will perform
through the pandemic. This was accomplished by reviewing higher risk sectors, loans participating in modification
programs and potential risk rating migration based on a granular bottoms up credit review.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
At the time we closed the books in early April, our outlook included a second quarter GDP decline of nearly 20%
with unemployment peaking just under 10% and a recovery beginning in the second half of 2020. As we move
into the second quarter, we will refine our assessment in three critical areas. First would be an update of our
outlook on macroeconomic variables. Second an updated review of higher risk sectors and a loan modification
programs. And third the assessment of the impact of government stimulus programs on our portfolio. Initial April
economic forecasts are projected to be more severe as the second quarter GDP decline could exceed 30% with
unemployment peaking at 15%. All of these areas are still developing, making it difficult to project how the
pandemic will impact the provision in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year. That being said our
provision in the second quarter will be driven more heavily by the expected duration and severity of the pandemic.
Slide 11 highlights our key asset quality metrics at March 31 prior to the effects of the current environment. Non-
performing loans in the upper left increased $12 million from Q4. C&I represented $9 million of the increase. Net
charge-offs in the upper right increased slightly from Q4 and totaled $7.8 million in the quarter. Commercial
classified loans in the lower left represented 287 basis points of total commercial loans. This compares to a 20
quarter average of 317 basis points. The allowance for credit losses increased to $335 million resulting in a
coverage ratio of 1.6%.
Slide 12 highlights our key liquidity metrics. Our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with a
strong competitive advantage more than $1.1 billion of core deposit growth in Q1 has maintained our favorable
loan-to-deposit ratio of 85%. We are predominantly core deposit funded with brokerage TDs representing less
than 0.5% of total deposits at March 31. In addition, our sources of secured borrowing capacity remained intact,
totaling over $9 billion at March 31.
Slide 13 highlights our key capital metrics. Our regulatory capital ratios exceed well-capitalized levels by
substantial amounts. The common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11% exceeds well-capitalized by $1 billion. While the
access for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is $809 million. The unprecedented environment makes it difficult to
provide formal guidance at this time. What I can tell you is, we expect average earning assets to grow in the
range of 4% over Q1, driven primarily by loan growth.
We expect net interest income to be flat to Q1 as a result of loan growth, Paycheck Protection Program volume
and lower deposit in borrowing costs to be somewhat offset by lower asset yields, as average market rates have
come down since Q1. Non-interest income will likely be flat to modestly down, given the mark, we recognized in
Q1, and non-interest expense will likely be flat to Q1's level. Our share count will be about 1.3 million shares lower
on average due to buybacks completed in Q1.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for a review of our credit profile.

Thanks, Glenn. Many of you know that I'm deeply involved in our credit execution as I grew up in commercial
lending and credit and served as Webster's Chief Credit Risk Officer during the financial crisis. As I said many
times, I'm proud of the credit risk framework that we have built over the last dozen years with respect to risk
selection, underwriting portfolio management and credit reporting and nearly $21 billion loan portfolio, we have
today has been thoughtfully and purposefully built. Well, I never predict credit performance the ultimate outcome
of which will be determined by the depth and duration of this crisis. I can't say that we have been true to our
underwriting guidelines and I'm very proud of our line of business and credit professionals who always put risk
management first. As I mentioned earlier Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer who joined us five years ago from
GE Capital is with us today on the phone and I will be – and he will be available for Q&A.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We'll now walk through the credit slides that we posted this morning with the earnings deck, I will respond to any
credit question during the general Q&A. Starting on slide 14, you'll see an outline for this discussion. As I
mentioned Jason and I will comment on our exposure to those segments most directly impacted by the COVID 19
pandemic. I'll then provide what I hope to be a clear and concise comparison of our current loan and securities
portfolios with our 2007 pre-Great Recession portfolios. And then I'll briefly walk through each of our loan
portfolios allowing Jason to provide some context with key metrics, so hopefully you'll get a sense to have a clear
granular view of the $21 billion we have in loans. I'll highlight on each slide without reading every detail, but I will
provide you with what I believe to be the key takeaways.
Slide 15 you've seen this disclosure from other banks as they have reported. This attempts to capture our loan
outstandings in each of the most impacted sectors including ratings, categories, modification and line draw activity
through 3/31, which Jason will update in a moment. I want to make clear we wanted to be transparent with this
disclosure. But this doesn't represent all of the loans that we think are at risk. Many of these loans are not at risk.
These are simply the categories that the industry has been reporting that are obviously most impacted in the first
order by the pandemic. In fact, 94% of these loans are pass-rated and you'll see here that there's been limited
modification and revolver draw activity. So I want to provide a little context there.
The key takeaway on this slide is that our direct exposure to these segments is modest on both an absolute and
relative basis. 94% as I said are in pass-rated categories, most representing 1% or maybe 2% of our total loan
portfolio. We are fortunate as our strategies have over the long-term been focused on less cyclical industries with
recurring cash flows. So on a relative basis, we've not really pushed hard on sectors like energy, transportation,
discretionary retail as focuses. The other point I want to make before letting Jason provide some context is that,
you'll see retail in a broadly defined represents 5% of our loan portfolio.
In this category, more than 50% of those loans are in high quality investor CRE and those are mostly in non-
discretionary pharmacy or grocery anchored. And for those of you who heard me talk about [ph] Bill Rang
(00:28:56) over 25 years with his retail exposure, he's always looking for non-discretionary. I'll also tell you that an
additional 20% of that retail exposure is fully followed in our ABL Group where credits are borrowing base secured
and often have cash dominion and I've been working with Warren Mino in that group for the entire 15 years, I've
been here and they have an unbelievable track record in managing even struggling large retail exposures. So,
we've got a lot of confidence within that pocket of retail.
Jason maybe I'll turn it over to you to make a couple of comments there.

Jason Soto
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Great. Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. To provide an update on the information on the slide as of
late last week, the overall piece of modification requests had slowed the last couple of weeks. Modifications are
up to $692 million versus the $517 million, revolver draws in these sectors are up modestly to $130 million versus
$122 million. That said, as John mentioned earlier, commercial modifications in total have been roughly $1.85
billion as of late last week. So we're clearly seeing modification activity beyond just these sectors.
Reality is that many of the companies being impacted may have a portion of their revenue tied to these sectors or
otherwise feeling the ripple effect of the current environment. It's a bit hard to capture all that with a straight top-
down approach by sector, and so for that reason, we're using a more granular bottoms-up approach to identify the
exposure to borrowers that we believe may be more impacted in the current environment. By exposure, we've

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
reviewed over 80% of the accounts in the portfolio and have reached out to the majority of those where we have
direct relationships.
We created a common framework to rate the potential level of impact to the borrowers, and we roll that up weekly
and have a call to review updates. Based on this, I believe we have a good handle on the exposure to borrowers
that may need some accommodation in the near term. I will also say that 90% of the borrowers that have
requested modifications are pass-rated and many have low loan to values [ph] junior capital (00:30:57), owner
and sponsor support and liquidity. So as soon we start to see a resumption of economic activity throughout 2020,
we're optimistic that the majority of these borrowers will recover and we will certainly do our part to support them
in a prudent way.

Thanks, Jason. Turning to page 16, these next three slides demonstrate the purposeful strategic shifts in our
portfolio since the Great Recession; this is the execution that I talked about earlier. The reason I think these three
slides are so important is that I've seen so many people use credit performance by asset class during the Great
Recession as a proxy for loss prediction during the next credit downturn like the one we are entering into right
now.
Again, I'll never promise or predict ultimate credit outcomes, but I can tell you that our portfolio today is vastly
different than what we had in 2007, not only are the portfolio dynamics different but the way we underwrite,
manage and report on risk is light years ahead of where we were in 2007 when we had only a few years earlier
transitioned to be an OCC-regulated commercial bank.
The key takeaway on this slide comparing Consumer and Business Banking loan portfolios and performance is
that the overwhelming majority of losses here come from broker originated, non-centrally underwritten out-of-
market mortgage and home equity loans and from a small portfolio of Business Banking unsecured loans.
We no longer originate out-of-market mortgages and home equity loans with few exceptions. We centrally
underwrite everything internally even correspondent in-market loans and we have been very disciplined on
underwriting guidelines over the last 10 years. Moreover, we have virtually no unsecured Business Banking loans
and we do not originate that product.
On page 17, it shows the same analysis for our Commercial Banking portfolios. We had outside losses in the
discreet Residential Development portfolio and a discretionary Aviation portfolio and equipment finance.
Consistent with my earlier comments, we have focused since the Great Recession on less cyclical verticals and
businesses and you can see here that our exposure in those two areas is minimal as a result.
Another key point on this slide is the fact that Sponsor & Specialty and leverage loans within our C&I business in
general performed at the same level or better than our other portfolios in the Commercial Bank, a point I've made
several times over earnings calls when asked about the nature of our leverage loans. While our sponsor and
leverage loan portfolios are larger today on an absolute basis, I'll remind you that they represent roughly the same
percentage of C&I loans as they represented in 2007, and they represent roughly the same percentage of Tier 1
capital plus reserves that they represented in 2007.
On page 18, this is a critical slide. You've heard me talk about the geography of our capital losses during the
Great Recession, here you can see that the single biggest category of losses or write-downs for us during the
financial crisis was not in the loan portfolios, but in trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio. Today
10

only 18% of our $8.5 billion securities portfolio was credit sensitive, compared to 44% in 2007. And the nature of
those credit sensitive instruments today is higher rated and higher quality. Again this was a purposeful strategy
shift from lessons learned during the Great Recession.
So the natural question after these three slides is, so you've eliminated those activities that drove the highest
losses, but are there other portfolios hidden in your overall loan portfolio that could blow up and have losses? And
again, I can't tell you that there's not going to be a specific segment or industry that will not have credit losses
depending on the depth and duration, but I can tell you our ability to monitor our portfolio, the surveillance we
have, the ability to look at correlated risk of cross portfolios, the quality of our risk management team is light years
ahead of what it was before. And I can tell you that we pivoted over time in the last 12 years on things like
contractors or traditional advertising based media so that we're able to make decisions quickly to reduce
emphasis in certain portfolios over time and we've done that.
So my confidence that there are hidden pockets of risk is much higher than it would have been during the Great
Recession. And I hope that those three slides provide some perspective on how thoughtful we've been about
building our portfolio, and the fact that we did take to heart lessons learned during the last downturn.
On slide 19, you'll see just an overview of the portfolio. And the truth is it's a straightforward mid-sized bank,
typical portfolio with obviously a sponsor book in there where we have industry expertise. You can see a high
level breakdown here of the $21 billion, and in the [indiscernible] (00:36:10) on the right you'll see where those
exposures reside. So for consumer finance, the $7.2 billion portfolio, $7 billion of that are prime end market
residential mortgages and home equity loans and then a small pocket of consumer finance which includes
LendingClub. I will speak to each of these on the following slides.
Our commercial real estate is comprised of a majority of it in our Commercial Banking investor CRE book run by
Bill Wrang for over 21 years here, who's had great asset performance even during the Great Recession. That also
encapsulates our Business Banking investor CRE and owner occupied CRE and it also includes owner occupied
middle market commercial real estate loans as well as some technology infrastructure data center like real estate
secured businesses. The C&I is typical C&I in middle market, in Sponsor & Specialty, it includes our enterprise
leveraged loans, asset-based lending and equipment finance and then you'll see the investment securities where
we make the point again on the breakdown between non-credit and credit sensitive instruments.
And on page 36 in the supplemental information, please don't turn to it now, you'll see a detailed breakdown of
the investment securities portfolio, which I will not cover here.
On page 20, residential mortgage. The key takeaway on this slide is that our $5 billion mortgage portfolio is a high
quality, prime, in-market, centrally underwritten portfolio with high FICO scores and modest LTVs both at
origination and when updated for today. Credit performance not surprisingly has been outstanding. And I told you
that we've only had a modest level of modification in payment deferral request to-date on this portfolio.
On page 21, home equity is pretty much the same story as mortgages, in-market, prime, strong FICO and LTV
metrics at origination and even slightly improved when updated today. We managed this book effectively through
end of draw on much of the portfolio and we have not seen interestingly any defensive drawdown activities on the
unfunded portion of these home equity loans thus far into the crisis. I also want to highlight one carrot there that
close to [ph] 50% – 5-0 (00:38:35) of this portfolio is in a first lien position.
On slide 22, personal lending, a very small $220 million, 80% of it represents LendingClub. And as you know, it's
about $176.2 million and has been coming down since a peak of about $230 million, $240 million. We stopped
11

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
purchasing lower tranches in 2017, purchasing just A's and B's. And recently just A's and we are no longer
purchasing LendingClub. If you look at it the FICO scores are strong and have been improving and we have not
seen credit performance in this small portfolio deteriorate yet, we'll obviously watch it closely. We've got good
geographic diversity in the portfolio and over the time we've been involved with LendingClub we have seen
performance in the portfolio that meets or exceeds expectations.
On page 23 in commercial real estate, our total CRE portfolio, we've had meaningful and targeted growth over the
last few years as we are good at it and we've been underweight compared to peers and when compared to
regulatory concentration hurdles. Majority of this business is in our investor CRE line within the Commercial Bank
led by the same management team for many years and through cycles.
I'll provide more detail on that $3.8 billion representing the 62% you see in the top chart there on the next page.
The overall portfolio was well diversified with limited exposure in more volatile sectors. And you know very little
hotel exposure, very little discretionary retail exposure, we've had less office exposure as well than we did you
know 10 years ago.
So on the next page let's do a deep dive on our largest exposures and our largest part of the portfolio. Focusing
on investor CRE, we've had a targeted strategy of growing multifamily and industrial selectively financing office
projects and strong markets. As I mentioned I think six times on this call already and I apologize, Bill Wrang with
us for more than 20 years who came out of Aetna, manages this portfolio. It's more of an institutional quality real
estate portfolio, it performed exceptionally well during the last downturn. It tends to be lower yielding but more
resilient during a tough credit time. We partner with experienced sponsors and equity partners and provide well-
structured solutions with sufficient cushion to withstand volatility.
If you look here at the origination metrics they've been very steady over the last few years despite competing in a
highly competitive lending environment, and that discipline tends to serve us well. It's also translated into very
strong updated portfolio statistics which are at the bottom chart there. So we're not talking about 80% loan-to-
value real estate loans, we're talking about a portfolio of 60% loan-to-value real estate loans with an average debt
service coverage ratio of nearly two times. Overall, and not surprisingly, asset quality is really strong in this
portfolio, and we've been reaching out to our customers aggressively and we will be managing through whatever
the crisis brings us, but we feel really good about this portfolio.
On page 25, you'll see the C&I portfolio balanced and diversified. This includes our sponsor and leveraged
portfolios, which are primarily industry focused, collaterally focused businesses in ABL and equipment finance,
[indiscernible] (00:42:16) businesses in middle market and Business Banking, both meaningful concentrations are
in broad diversified categories such as services and communications, a good portion of which is software
technology and infrastructure originated in our sponsor business. And we've maintained lower exposure in
construction and retail, as well as finance companies which we feel could represent correlated risk with our
broader portfolio, so we have deemphasized over time those segments.
On page 26, we'll talk about Sponsor & Specialty and Leveraged on these last two pages, and I'll ask Jason to
provide a little more color and context. One of the important things that we always talk about and I'm not sure is
fully understood is that our Sponsor & Specialty business is $3.3 billion or something. Only a third of that is
leveraged loans. We're reporting here leveraged loans which are leveraged at origination based on regulatory
definitions, generally three by four senior to total leverage. So a full two-thirds of our Sponsor & Specialty portfolio
is acquisition and industry specific financing that does not qualify as leveraged loans.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Most of our leveraged loans are in this book, over 80%. We've been lending to sponsor backed and leveraged
companies since 2004 when Chris Motl and I arrived at the bank and as you saw earlier in the presentation, the
performance has been strong and in line with overall C&I even through a cycle. We meaningfully shifted this book
over time to make sure that we're lending to non-cyclical end markets that have recurring, protectable, predictable
streams of cash flow. You'll see that software, tech and infrastructure has grown from about one-third of the
portfolio to almost 50%, again that's because of the nature of the transactions in the underlying companies and
these companies seem to be less susceptible to this particular crisis as well.
Healthcare is another defined vertical what we seek to support routine medical services that will benefit from
demographic trends, and at the same time we've shifted away from some segments that are less predictable and
less protectable from a cash flow perspective.
And the last slide I'll cover before I let Jason provide a little context on Sponsor & Specialty is slide 27, and this is
something that I talked about a little over a year ago on an earnings call when we talked about leveraged lending.
This page shows comparative metrics between what we're originating in Sponsor & Specialty and the broader
leveraged loan capital markets. On average, we have 1 to 1.5 turns less leverage on the deals we do versus the
market at less risk. We've maintained discipline on covenants with only 7% of our book being covenant lite where
the general market is almost 84% covenant lite.
The leveraged deals we have, those that are leveraged loans are still 0.5 to 1 turn inside the broader leveraged
market, and non-leverages are almost 2 turns inside the market. When we look at the borrowers' ability to service
debt, we have a very strong profile with 85% to 90% having fixed charge coverage ratios of greater than 1.5 times
and on average for both leveraged and non-leveraged deals in sponsor, our loan-to-value, that's the loan to the
enterprise value, is between 35% and 40% on average. In most cases with significant cash equity or junior debt
beneath us and the sponsors that we have worked with through financial crises with relationships over a long time
have deep financial and management resources to help us through a downturn. We saw that during the 2008
crisis.
Jason, can you put maybe a finer point on some of those or fill in something I might have missed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, look John, I think you hit all of the key points. I guess the only thing I would say is we've really increased the
percentage of direct deals that we've done over the last four, five years from about half to about two-thirds which
we think is important.
And I guess the last thing I'd probably add, and I think it just speaks to the credit culture here at the bank is our
strategy in sponsor and leverage have not only been deliberate but it also has been very collaborative between
the lines of business and credit. We've been particularly disciplined in moving away from the areas that you
mentioned like traditional media, restaurants as well as smaller cyclical credits where we've had some historical
losses. And we've also been very clear about our underwriting parameters as we've grown.
And for example, in [ph] tech and infrastructure (00:46:56) which is the largest segment, when we talk about
financing or recurring revenue business models, 90% of the exposure in that book has over 70% recurring
revenue. There's only one deal that has less than 50% of recurring revenue in that book, which again represents
almost half of the sponsor book.
13

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
If deals come in outside those parameters [indiscernible] (00:47:17) generally just pass. And again, it's not to say
that those deals will be bulletproof right. It really depends on the end markets those customers serve and the
competitive dynamics, but our thesis is that the services and software being provided are making customers more
efficient and smarter about their businesses. So we expect that once installed, the revenue will be sticky.

Hey, good morning, everyone.

Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. To start on the reserve, so given – Glenn you called out some of the assumptions in the 1Q
reserve and the economic outlook appears to be a bit worse than that. Just based on how you guys are seeing
how CECL is now working, should we see a COVID-19 impact in the reserve in 2Q similar to what we saw on 1Q
given the change of model assumptions look like they're coming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No, I mean we don't see that. I talked in my comments about – first let me back up and just say our CECL is an
estimate of multiple scenarios and modeled bosses as a result of that and then we did a bottoms-up granular
build as I indicated. So I think our reserves that are provisioned in the second quarter will depend less on like a
2Q shock and more on the expected duration and severity of the economy over the next one or two years, right.
And so we additionally we have to assess the impact of the stimulus programs, and our own loan modification
14

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
programs. And then we'll evaluate that over the next couple of weeks, but I don't see it as anywhere near where
we were in Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Steve let me give you context too, I know it's so hard for you and obviously it's hard for all of us because what
we're doing is with the knowledge that we have as we're going through the process, we're giving – we use a third-
party obviously with respect to data like many of our peers do and then we look at that and we look at the
applicability to our portfolio with what we're seeing, the results of our bottoms-up approach to looking at all the
commercial credits reaching out to our borrowers and it all filters in and what we try to determine at that time with
the best forward outlook we have on the economy and the best information we have on portfolio performance is
our models assess the life of – life losses, lifetime losses, life of loan losses in the portfolio.
And so, what I think will happen in Q2 is the banks will continue to revise based on what the forward outlook is,
and I think Glenn made a really good point. I also think that we'll have better indications of how much the fiscal
stimulus and other programs have helped to help maybe mitigate or offset some of that, and at the end of the day
depending on the depth and severity of the future economic forecast at that point in time that will impact and
influence the magnitude of either additional provisions or no additional provisions or if somehow we miraculously
start to reverse course the release of provisions over time. But I think it's really based on you know what the
macroeconomic forecasts will be as we approach the end of the second quarter.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
John in terms of the specific exposures, I appreciate all the color you're giving on credit, but if we look at the most
impacted sectors on slide 15, which is really helpful, but there's a lot to unpack on that slide. Can you walk us
through which of those do you see as the most risk specific to Webster and maybe which do you see as being
less risky, just specific to you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. And I'll let Jason obviously because he's got a good perspective on it for us. And you know I think
restaurants are obviously probably at risk. I look at that portfolio we do have some you know broader – those
aren't you know on the corner store restaurants, for the most part they're brought our sponsor backed restaurants
with high brand names, so you know we believe there's a good chance of survival but they'll be impacted. We
have very little oil and gas, very little travel and leisure from a hotel perspective.
So for me I think about restaurants – I think about what exposure we might have to nondiscretionary retail,
although I said that that's relatively small. So I would say that those are probably the most directly impacted.
Jason, I don't know if you want to provide some color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. Sure. Happy to. Yes, I'd echo the comment on restaurants, right. Luckily we have a relatively small exposure
and it's a portfolio that we've actually been working down over the last couple of years. I would also say that our
average [ph] whole size (00:53:05) in that portfolio is subsequently less than other parts of – most of that
exposures in the sponsor portfolio. And we haven't to-date taken material losses, so far we've got borrowers who
15

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
are – have multiple locations diversified geographically. But that's certainly part of the portfolio that I would be
concerned about.
We've already talked about retail, a lot of that is collateralized. I guess a few of the other sectors that I'm focused
on is things like advertising base which again we don't have a ton of companies that put on host or support
conferences and large gatherings, right, in business services to those. And also we're seeing a lot of pressure at
the moment in some of the routine healthcare services like dentists, optometrists, physical therapy, things like
that. But you assume that most of that will recover. So there are definitely some pockets that we're looking at. You
could even focus a little bit on perhaps smaller [indiscernible] (00:54:09) consumer behavior change after this.
Those are the things that I start to think about in the areas that I focus on.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And maybe if I could squeeze one in for Chad. If we look at footing and account
growth in HSA, it seems to slow year-over-year for you and the industry. Is this a new normal for the HSA
business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Chad, do you want it directly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chad Wilkins A
HSA Bank, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I would say it's not a new normal. I think that we're going through; one, we've seen some as
I've talked in multiples over the last several quarters, we've seen slowness related to some of the tailwinds
subsiding in the industry. I do think that in a recession, there's an opportunity for HSAs or high deductible plans to
grow more significant because they tend to do well in economic downturns [indiscernible] (00:55:05) reduce
medical costs and so on.
I think there is a potential impact, ongoing impact as we look throughout the year with regard to the current
pandemic [indiscernible] (00:55:18) benefits plans and/or you've seen some [indiscernible] (00:55:25) of folks
impacting plans. So we're paying close attention to that. We haven't seen any impact yet in the first quarter other
than perhaps some slowdown in some of the RFP volume in the end of the quarter.

Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So obviously, it's a million dollar question on how you guys are thinking about the reserve and how you build that
going forward, but just trying to put that into some sort of context, so if we look at what you added or you added
for the loan growth this quarter, it looks like it was like a [ph] $135 million (00:56:14) reserve. Can you just maybe
help us sort of understand why that – why that reserve came in the way it did, you're sitting at [ph] $160 million
(00:56:22), where it could go just kind of – just framing that a little bit for us...
[indiscernible] (00:56:29)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. So Collyn, yeah, so most of the growth that we had in the quarter as I said in my prepared comments, was
on the commercial side. So we're up by $855 million. So depending on what portfolio grows and the risk profile of
the portfolio that will drive the reserves for the quarter. So that's why it's a little lower than the total reserve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Collyn, it's – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, go ahead. Go ahead, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No, I was just going to say, it's really hard to give any more context except to say. I think we chose, as Glenn told
you, the actual underlying economic performance variables on unemployment and GDP and house prices that he
used, we then did a qualitative review as Jason spoke to really bottoms-up and I think we really know our portfolio
very well, looked at potential risk rating migration over time, the level of modification activity and what we tried to
do was on the day that we put our pencils down we tried to using our models and using our Q-Factor come up
with life of loan losses across the $21 billion loan portfolio and across a securities portfolio of $8.5 billion.
And so I think when you think about what all the other banks are doing, some of them put their pencils down
earlier, we tried to take a conservative approach at our current economic forecast also looking at some of the
potential behavioral elements in our portfolio. And so we feel really good that we meet the requirements of CECL,
17

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
and obviously what happens with this, the good part about it is as we move forward based on actual
[indiscernible] (00:58:11) portfolio and based on a forward look of the economy our – the view will change and the
models will change and it's really hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison. What I can tell you is we feel really
good about our portfolio as I walk through, our CECL is not an indication that we're trying to get ahead of some
issue we don't see. We literally feel like right now that's the appropriate number given all the information we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess it is a hard question to answer, but just anecdotally and you guys
have so much detail, which the five of you offered were fantastic. Thank you for that. But the question obviously is
the duration of this – of the COVID-19 experience, do you have a sense of what [indiscernible] (00:58:59) the
majority of your customers like how long they can sort of withstand and stay operating and stay afloat and
modify? And I mean is this something they can carry through the next quarter or two or if this goes, I'm just trying
to get a sense of where their heads are on how they're thinking about the duration of this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. And I will let Jason comment here as well. I mean obviously that's a tough question. But the sense – I think
the sense is if you look at – I mean Jason made a very important point. We showed 3/31 modifications in line
draws, we then also on the documents we then told you verbally what it was as of April 16 and we made a
comment that the activity had slowed which is interesting, right. So the number of modification requests and the
number of defensive line draws slowed over time. That's actually a positive sign.
We're working with a lot of our borrowers. Regulators have given banks greater flexibility in terms of being able to
make payment deferrals and modifications over time. And I do think that given the parameters and bank's capital
position, and this just isn't for Webster, I'm giving you kind of a general view, that we have the opportunity to
modify three months, we can do another three or six month modification at the end of that period. There's a lot of
liquidity coming into the market. There's a lot of programs like the Main Street Lending Program hasn't even hit
yet which will give some larger borrowers opportunity for additional capital if they can't get it from their banks. The
PPP program is being refunded. The checks are coming out to individuals and families.
So I think there is a sense that if we actually start, what is it, Opening Up America Again, within a reasonable
period of time that all of those bridges with the bank support and with good operating management by our
borrowers that we can get through this.
So, that's anecdotal, right. You're asking me an anecdotal question, I'm giving you an anecdotal answer that says,
we haven't seen a lot of our borrowers say, if I don't get out of this in the next two months, I'm gone, right. If
everybody is working together and there is a feeling that banks can be supportive, sponsors can be supportive of
their companies, the government is providing financial support. So that's just my view. Jason, I don't know if you
have anything else to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, look I think you hit all the right points in terms of the stimulus, unemployment benefits, PPP. As
evidence of that perhaps is we've actually seen some borrowers withdraw modification requests once the PPP
sort of went into effect and so we're seeing some evidence of that support. And then what I could do is, I could
break down if you think about the type of modifications that we've been doing by line of business. I would say
18


Webster Financial Corp.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
generally three to six months right. So, on the consumer side it's been almost all three months. So, we'd obviously
have some ability to further extend if the impact of the virus goes on further.
On our small business, Business Banking about a third has been up to three months and two-thirds has been up
to six months. On the commercial side, it's been up to three to six months. And two-thirds of that is payment
related balances more covenants and borrowing base. So I kind of look at this right now between the stimulus
programs and the modifications that we've been granting three to six months plus the benefit of those programs
feels like a lot of our borrowers can withstand that timing of impact.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:02:47) so I wanted to ask about the leveraged loans. You mentioned about how sponsors have
been willing to step up and support their companies. If we look back to the financial crisis, how much – do you
have a sense of how much new capital was actually contributed by sponsors to support their companies, to
support the challenges they face back then?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
I don't have a number David, and I would be doing you a disservice if I guessed one, but what I can tell you and if
you remember in that call a year ago I talked about that our credit performance in our Sponsor & Specialty
business was actually better than many of our secured lending portfolios. It was one of the best performers in
terms of actual loss. It had risk rating migration in it, but what I can tell you just again anecdotally and from
experience is that if a sponsor has significant cash equity in a platform company unless there is some sort of
paradigm shift that makes that company completely not valuable, if 70% of the capital structure is their equity and
we're lending at 30%, 40% of the capital structure, they're not just going to turn over the keys if they think that this
is a temporary crisis.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
So again I think it comes back to depth and duration, and we have evidenced that during the financial crisis, if
we're backing good sponsors, who are buying good companies [indiscernible] (01:04:08) with banks providing
covenant relief and additional liquidity and the sponsors providing capital support, those businesses tend to make
it through. And again that's anecdotal, can't make any promises, but that's what we've seen and we saw during
the financial crisis.

Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
John, if you don't mind I could jump in a little bit as well. I would say that as you all know the level of dry powder
that's out there sitting in private equity funds right to support existing investments has never been higher. And so
– and you couple that with the fact that the multiples for LBOs have gone up and so the percentage of equity
that's in these capital structures disproportionate increase versus the amount of debt that had gone on.
So you know I think there's going to be a lot of incentives to support borrowers that have good business models,
that are experiencing sort of deep short-term impact. And we were actually already seeing that with some of the
modification requests that we've got and we're sponsoring and we'd be willing to put in some equity, provide us
with a little bit of a [indiscernible] (01:05:10) to get access more liquidity and things like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And you just touched on in a little bit for one of my follow-ups. Are you getting anything in return for providing you
know loan modifications to these leveraged borrowers either in the form of consent fees or additional equity
contribution from the sponsors to provide those modifications?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, we are getting some additional equity, we are getting in some cases that [indiscernible] (01:05:41) revolve
for $2 million more and we'll give you a guarantee. We're taking the opportunity to add in LIBOR floors on a good
substantial portion that are coming in, which is obviously helpful in a different way. So we're not – I don't think
we're focusing so much on big fees right. Our goal is to help our borrowers at this point get through the time, but
also improve our position where we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
That's right. I'd remind you that these are really strong relationships over time, so both parties work to get to the
best outcome, so good answer Jason and the answer is yes, we're close to these folks and we work with them not
at cross-purposes.

So it was a couple months that we've been talking to them. As far as competitive, I think it landed more on our
ability and our capabilities from an acquisition standpoint less on price it wasn't – it wasn't an auction or anything
like that. And we've struck a very good partnership with them which we're looking forward to working with them
going forward.

Q
First – Good morning. First looking at the level of PPP lending, it was a little bit smaller than what we've seen out
of some of your peers. Was this a choice at Webster or was this something structural that limited the level of
production? And as we look at future SBA programs coming onboard, what level of participation should we expect
from Webster?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
That's a good question. Now certainly we wanted to help every small business borrower and customer of Webster
that we could. We got through, let's say, approximately 30% applications approved, 30% funding plus or minus a
few percentage points on both sides of that. We fully expect to trump those numbers significantly higher over the
next few days as we've got internal approvals, so I would say, no, the answer is we – at yeoman's effort we
repositioned almost 300 people in the organization to go through it.
Obviously there were technical issues at points with [indiscernible] (01:08:32) system. We've worked on trying to
make our automated process a little bit more efficient. So I'd say we're kind of right in that national average,
although you're right to point out that we trailed some and we're going to work our butt off to make sure that when
the funds come up – open up again that we close that gap a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. And then can you disclose what the kind of weighted average fee was for the [indiscernible] (01:09:02)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think we're probably in the range between 2% and 3% [ph] Timor (01:09:11) And we're funding basically the
PPP all after 35 basis points. So it helps us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
And then just last one for me. Not sure if you can disclose this or not, but the current reserving for the
LendingClub loans and for the restaurant portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No. We're not going to disclose by segment, although again I'll just make a qualitative determination that didn't
drive reserving disproportionately to anything else and it's less than 1% of the portfolio and it does not have a
disproportionate impact based on our loss modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Just wondered if we could go back to slide 15, which by the way your detail is great. I really appreciate that. If we
can just start by looking at the total – the total of $2.8 billion that you have here, how much of that is real estate on
this slide if you know approximately? I mean, obviously you gave us the detail around the retail being 58% CRE,
so that puts it at $600 million. Just didn't know if you had how much is actually real estate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Right, Jason probably does not have that off the top of the head, but I would actually want to – I asked you first
Jason, and then otherwise I can give a relatively rough estimate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The main components in there that are retail and is hotels and motels, right. So it does not include some of
the multifamily and office properties that I mentioned before. it's also going to be in retail as we talked about 58% I
think is the number is CRE collateralized retail and we talked about some of the characteristics of that, right. So
call that $600 million or so, call the hotels another $125 million. There may be a little bit scattered in the
restaurants in our small business but that's probably the sum total of the real estate, a little less than $1 billion is
my guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And on construction and related?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A

Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then in your Travel & Leisure category, what primarily is that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So that's everything from fitness facilities to conference providers or companies that support conferences
[indiscernible] (01:12:03) rock climbing, those types of golf clubs, YMCA. It's a variety of different types of leisure
activities for the most part, a little less in travel unless we do have one or two borrowers that support travel
events, right. They put on travel shows and so that's probably the lion's share that goes in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey guys. Follow up on the – Glenn, the average earning asset growth you're expecting I think 4% in the second
quarter here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just the composition of that, I mean the $650 million that you booked quarter-to-date is roughly half that 4% move
and it sounds like you're going to – you're going to be doing more on the program refunds. So my question is, is
this 4% growth – is this going to be entirely PPP or is there going to be any core loan growth along this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No. So, I think a lot of our commercial growth came in at period end. So, we'll get to pull that into the second
quarter and on a PPP side it's probably about half of it. And so I'd say, above 5% on average, if you look that is
probably about $500 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. And Casey, if that question also kind of tries to get to, what's going on in the core underlying, I made the
comment, we closed the big deal in April on a technology infrastructure transaction. I looked at our pipeline, it's
clearly lower than it's been, generally this is a seasonal low pipeline anyway, but it's slightly lower than last year.
As I said, we're going to be more careful obviously, you're lending into uncertainty. And so you need to make sure
that the underlying fundamentals work obviously, only cutting the other way, you do have a little bit more
leverage. And I use that word, I probably shouldn't use that word, but as a lender you have a little bit more
leverage to make sure that your structure and your pricing work. So I would say, Glenn is right, it seems...

[indiscernible] (01:15:51).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
... in fact it – yeah, in fact, we had a lot of fundings at the end of the year, we'll carry – at the end of the quarter,
we'll carry through the next quarter. We've got PPP and through some from the Main Street Lending Program.
And then a lower level, but a decent level of organic growth. And then the last thing, I will say is we do anticipate
and I'm always asked about pay downs. I do think just with the general level of uncertainty and lower economic
activity, we'll probably, see lower pay downs, which will help to keep that earning asset number up.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Okay, great. And just if I place together the NII and earning asset, it looks like you're implying a NIM down about
10 bps in the second quarter. Can you just confirm that and then if you could – were spot rates for loan yields and
deposit costs at 3/31 basis points, if you have that Glenn?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So – Yeah. So I think your NIM is probably in the range and I think if you look at our outlook on rates going into
the second quarter, we're assuming the 10-year – it's probably around 70 basis points with three-month LIBOR,
about this is – and this is the full quarter average about 77 basis points. So one month LIBOR about 53 basis
points. And you've seen that trade up close to 70 basis points, but we think that will come back in, and if that
comes, obviously around 24 basis points. So, the market rate continue to go down. And I think – so I think, if you
look at our net interest income you have continued rate pressure, but is offset by loan volume. So the net result is
our net interest income is flat, basically flat quarter-over-quarter. But I think your NIM estimate is probably in the
range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just last one on the capital management front. No, I understand that PPP is – carries a zero risk
weight, but it does hurt the [ph] TC ratio at 7:7 today, where is – is there a floor (01:17:52) that where you guys
would not want to go even you would not want to see that dip below even regardless of what you did with PPP?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think we have plenty of room there. It's – it would be very low – I mean, it's gotten below 7% before, we didn't
have any issue with it.

Hey. Good morning, Matt. And you put out a whole bunch of good credit pieces in the last few weeks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
I appreciate that. Thank you. Just on the PPP, wanted to just a point of clarification, how are you treating the fees,
are those going to roll through NII or non-interesting income? And then what is your average life of loan there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So we're assuming about 24 months in the average life of loan and yes it will roll through NII, until to the extent,
there's any pull forward, obviously, that would pop NIM, right, and then net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then just looking at some of the more granular aspects of the C&I portfolio, you mentioned that
your equipment finance is 7% of that book. Can you just walk us through some of the common types of equipment
that you like to underwrite or stay away from? And if you have it, I would love to hear how much of this equipment,
if you know is active versus idle right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes, that's a great question and obviously, we've lowered the amount of disclosure because the portfolio used to
be over a $1 billion, it's much smaller now. I can tell you that it's generally things like yellow metals, fleets of
school buses, tractor beds and other things. Jason, I don't know, you probably have more of a granular insight
into the collateral types. I don't think, we have the active and dormant stats right now, but Jason, do you have
anything to add there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, I don't have the details on what's idle and what's sort of working at this point, but you hit the major
categories. It's primarily trucking, it's auto transport. There's some yellow iron and cranes, a little bit of
construction, we've reduced that a fair amount as well as buses, whether it'd be mostly charter buses. So it's – but
it's definitely more on the trucking side, which it's interesting, we're seeing modifications there, but – and there are
certain companies that just flat out. It just depends on what markets they're serving, right. So but, yeah, that's the
primary breakdown.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And I think, I think Matt, I may have shared this and I'm not sure, I believe that of the 300 Commercial Banking
units, of modifications, the actual borrowers that about 100 of those are small ticket equipment financed. So, we
are seeing some activity there, but as Jason said, it's kind of hit or miss in terms of what's happening there. So
small dollar amounts, but more higher volume request for modifications in equipment finance. But we'll try and
disclose more next time around.

million healthcare loans in the C&I portfolio. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the types of healthcare
whether it's hospitals or outpatient, skilled nursing, nursing homes that type of thing?

Jason Soto A

Okay. Yeah, it's mostly skilled nursing right, is what we've got is probably about $300 million. And then we've got
what I'll call some senior living facilities right, that are sort of lump to the same category whether it's independent
living, assisted living and memory care. I think John mentioned before in his comments, data centers is a big – is
another section of about $250 million and those are real high quality assets with 10 year to 15 year contracts with
really, really high quality borrowers, AA, AAA borrowers take-or-pay contracts. And then on the mid-market side,
it's more owner occupied type properties in footprint.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. I guess going back to the reserve given your assumptions that we could be fairly much in a V-
shaped type recovery. Can you just talk about the magnitude of difference, if I get that if unemployment goes
where GDP falls 18% goes down to 30%. It's probably not as big as the initial GDP move. But what's the
magnitude if you assume instead of a second half recovery is maybe a 2021 recovery. So, we actually go through
say three more quarters of very depressed economic activity?

I'm not sure I can quantify that for you, Ken, what I can say is that, if the assumptions around recovery end up
being more dire as you move forward. We'll probably see some of the management overlay that we put forth this
quarter actually flow into the numbers. So, we might not need as much qualitative adjustment to the underlying
models, but I would say, Glenn, what's the most recent April – the difference in terms of what we see in terms of

So, it's probably another 12 basis points lower in Q2, but then the recovery is much stronger. I'm not sure Ken,
just to go back a little bit – I'm not sure we're thinking of a V-shaped recovery. We're thinking of a more gradual
recovery towards the second half of the year and that's really what our estimate again is a mix of multiple
scenarios and multiple model losses and that's really what we're focused on. But it is something as John indicates
that we're monitoring very closely and I don't think anyone has a precise answer right now, but based on
everything, we've had and making model adjustments and then looking at our portfolio building it up from a
granular basis and seeing how our customers would behave over the next 90 to 120 days, this is where we ended
up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah and Glenn I completely understand where you're trying to get to, but it's exactly what Glenn said, because
we're going to see – if we see risk-rating migration depending on the impact of all of the stimulus and the
government programs and our modifications, over time, we're going to see changes in whether it's a V or a U or
an L-shape. And so we kind of have to wait to see how that plays out to really figure out, because we may have a
more – a longer recovery period, but we may see a really strong impact of fiscal stimulus and all of those
variables go into our modeling and our CECL; and we kind of have to wait to the end of the quarter to see where
that is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Go it. Yeah. I guess I was trying to figure out like whether it be like, I say an L-shaped recovery you less GDP
decline. Like, if that could have say multiples of the reserve build they saw this quarter. Again I am just trying to
size the impact on what matters more to your reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. I think in all of those different models, we ran I don't think its multiples, right. I think multiples is maybe
more the depth or another shock or some issue, but in terms of the nature of the recovery if you think I think that
30

death may be more impactful than the duration in some respects. So, I do think that if you look at our going out if
we end up going away from a V or U more towards an L, but it's not multiples...

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Just on the PPP. Did I understand you right that it looks like the margin on that program was about either from 75
to 125 basis points to 200 to 300 basis points on rate with a 75-basis point funding? And then did you – what kind
of additional fees are you incurring in those, I mean, earning? And are you dealing with existing customers and
are those providing additional relationship activities that you might develop into other business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think we're probably...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So I think – Bernie, its Glenn. Good morning. We're probably – we have a coupon of about 1% and then with the
fees, we're probably in the range between 2.5% to 3%. The funding is at about 35 basis points through the [ph]
PPLF (01:26:51), which is – you set up uniquely for this. So that that gets you probably maybe a little higher than
what your range was.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
So the program has about a 1% interest rate and then has sliding fees depending on the size, you got to look for,
we're doing, I think 80% – about 80% of our applications that have been below $350,000. So those carry higher
levels of fees, so you kind of put that all together and it increases NIM to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
The average life does mean, your spread could be 2.25% to 2.50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And your question on customers versus non-customers, we have – we work with both and we haven't denied. We
– our primary focus is to help our customers. And as you can tell Bernie from the stats we gave, unfortunately,
when the money ran out, we haven't helped as many customers as I would have like to help, albeit, we did an
unbelievable job, [indiscernible] (01:27:45) the people working remotely from – and bringing people in from other
areas and leveraging technology. But we've accepted applications from both primarily, roughly 90% of the
applications we received both from customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Would that provide you with any opportunity to do more business with them? I mean I'm just wondering if it allows
you to get deeper into the customer?

John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you, philosophically, it's not our primary concern. Right now, to try and be part
of this solution and I'm actually talking with other bank CEOs on a frequent basis about making sure that this
program does, what it should be. But certainly, if you're there and you take care of your customers and non-
customers, presumably, that's going to have an added benefit overtime. And I think you know we'll obviously be
able to talk about impact to customers and non-customers as the program works itself through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Very helpful. Thanks. On the securities portfolio was the increase on slide 6 as a result of market appreciation
with major drops in interest rates or did you add to the to the portfolios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
36. Okay. Yeah. So we did add to the portfolio, you can see that in our balance sheet period and I think grew up
$283 million quarter-over-quarter.

Bernard Robert Horn Q

Bernard Robert Horn Q

So you actively purchased additional securities, it wasn't just from the increased rates drop?

Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
I mean, in part to [indiscernible] (01:29:36) at six-year duration in part to help or improve our asset sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Early in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Yeah. Yeah, so I guess that partially answers my next part of the question, which is given that that portfolio has
swung from a total loss to – I mean from a loss to a gain any – given that interest rates are so low where they are
right now can you comment on whether you might change your outlook on how you hold that securities portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
I think it's too early...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A

...too early to say, Bernie. In terms of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
We obviously like it from an interest rate risk standpoint, we use it to manage our asset sensitivity and we use it
the best portion of our liquidity. So I think we'd sort of triangulate those three and we arrive at where we think we
could be, obviously, there's a lower risk weighted securities, so it doesn't take up a lot of capital either. So, we like
where we're positioned right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
Okay. Last question is on, could you comment on the CD roll forward and re-pricing of what you're seeing there?

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think we've seen the CD balance has come down, part of that in response we pulled back on a lot of
promotional programs in most of our markets. So, I think you see – what you see in these customers sort of
pausing and moving into other funds, not locking up their money over a longer term. And so as a result our CD
portfolio has shortened, but again it helps our asset sensitivity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Robert Horn Q
President & Portfolio Manager, Polaris Capital Management LLC
And any comment on the amount of those CDs that will be re-pricing over the next two or three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.

Operator: Gentlemen, our next question is from the line of William Wallace with Raymond James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A

Hey good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
On the – on slide 15, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the risk migration of the ratings within the
past category as you modify these loans and if you didn't give it already how has that modifications number
changed since 3/31?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll let Jason do that. We did update William the revolver draws modifications on those pages with and
Jason will repeat that for you. And there hasn't been – let me make one general statement and I can give it to
Jason. There hasn't been much risk rating migration yet right because you're going through this process and
you're really looking at reported numbers where your customers are and things that are purely temporary and
35

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
COVID-19 related from a modification perspective don't necessarily warrant a downgrade based on regulatory
guidance specific to the pandemic. So, we haven't seen much and I think when all of you get on the calls with all
of the banks in the second – for the second quarter earnings, you're probably going to be able to see a better
indication of actual ratings migration. But Jason do you want to update those modification stats and revolver
draws stats from page 15 as of April 16th?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Up from $517 million to $692 million and revolver draws only up modestly from $122 million to $130
million. And in terms of the risk rating migration yeah I think we're sort of taking a – all right ,let's wait and see, so
to speak and as we get more information as to how long the pandemic will – pandemic impact will last, but we've
made sure, as Glenn went through that we've captured an appropriate reserves to reflect the modification activity
that we've seen and the potential risk rating migration we expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, I mean, I know it's impossible to know exactly at what point, you'll start to adjust, but is it three months
when you start to worry about what the cash flow recoveries for these loans might look like, is it six months or is it
too impossible to give it...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, no. I don't think there's a rule of thumb. So you saw a downgrades. We have higher classifieds in the
quarter. We're watching every single loan in every single portfolio. So, we're just being disciplined to the approach
that you downgrade once the ongoing financial metrics trigger into a new grade category or if you think you're
potentially at risk for further downgrade and it goes to watch special mention or substandard. So, we'll do that and
we're still doing that. I'm just saying given where we are, we have not yet seen a meaningful risk rating migration
that you may see depending on the depth and duration of the downturn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, thank you very much. Appreciate it guys.

question.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys, good morning and thank you for all that detail on credit. Just two quick questions. First, can you give
us a sense for what percentage of your commercial loan portfolio do you think ultimately will go into forbearance?
And then, secondly, if you could just, Glenn, clarify your comments on the margin, I missed those? I apologize,
the outlook for the margin.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Okay. No, Mark, actually it's great to have you on the call and we've gone a long time on this call, so appreciate
you hanging in there. I'll take a crack and then maybe see if Jason wants to put another comment. What's very
interesting is and we talked about this that, if you look at the modifications through April 16th, right, we gave that
number verbally on the whole portfolio slightly up and the revolver draws. We've seen a slower trend right, so it's
hard to predict. Again looking at depth and duration, it's who's going to come to us for more modifications. We
don't know whether the PPP program if in fact, even if they authorize another $250 billion, if you look at the
statistics, probably, everybody that qualifies doesn't get funded.
So maybe, if those people who are eligible and do not receive a loan, maybe they come and ask for modifications,
so there could be an uptick after that. But what's fascinating is, is the amount of defensive draws in the portfolio
and the amount of modification requests is sort of kind of slowed down with respect to pace and trending. So it
doesn't look like now at least in what we're seeing that we're going to see a flurry of additional modifications, I
think it will be dependent upon particular challenges by independent – under independent circumstances by
borrower. Jason, I don't know if you think that's accurate, correct me if you if you want to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Soto A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. All I'd say is we've actually seen net revolver reductions through the first half of the month from we talked
about the $450 million or so that were draws in March and almost $100 million that has been paid back down, so
that's a bit of an encouraging sign. And again across all the lines of business we've seen less modification over
the last couple of weeks in the last week in particular. It's hard to peg exactly where we think this might end up.
But what I can tell you is we do have that weekly update and bottoms up approach that we go through updating
those numbers exactly. And so, we do think we're going to see more than what we've seen so far. It may slow
down for now. We may see another waive when some of the initial modification requests be granted sort of come
back for further discussion once we have more information. But we're on it and we have a very good feel as to
what we think we might see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And Mark I don't know if you were on the call at the beginning. But I did give as of April 16th right in the mortgage
and residential books combined that's about a $7 billion prime book, about $476 million or 6.5% had requested
and been granted modifications as of April 16th, that's last week. In small business, 750 borrowers reflecting $300
million or 17% of our Business Banking, $1.7 billion Business Banking portfolio, 17% have been modified. And in
commercial about 300 borrowers representing $1.6 billion or 13% of the commercial funded loan book had been
requested or granted modifications.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. And then the question on the margin for Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. And so Mark, good morning. We're assuming the following as far as our average rate forecast for the
second quarter. We think in a 10-year swap of probably around 70 basis points, three-year LIBOR rate on
average around 77 basis points and a one-month LIBOR rate somewhere around 53 basis points. And of course,
37


Webster Financial Corp.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
[indiscernible] (01:38:41). And so it's making that sort of assumption, again I would say that you can assume that
our net interest income will be flat quarter-over-quarter say at [ph] $2.30, $2.31 (01:38:53) somewhere around
there. There continued to be margin pressure. And it could be 10 basis points to 12 basis points depending on the
mix. So it's hard to tell this early, but I mean that's about where we think we'll be at this point.
