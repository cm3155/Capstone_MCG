Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Alan, and good morning everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call. We had overall I consider a
strong quarter with strong earnings and returns, very good expense control, strong fee income, especially in
insurance and investment banking, excellent asset quality which Clarke will talk about, really good progress on
merger integration, and excellent internal recognitions, including an outstanding CRA rating for our community
development effort.
If you're following along, on slide 4, we always like to focus on the most important which is our culture. As you've
heard us say many times, we continue to reiterate culture is the primary determinant of our long-term success.
Our purpose really connects with our teammates. We've been really excited about this. Our teammates are driven
to really help our clients. We really enjoy serving our communities and our shareholders. Even with COVID, we've
made great progress in activating our culture, created a culture council which works every day with our [ph] EL
team (00:02:30) causing our culture to really come alive. So, we've made excellent progress in terms of culture,
which is ultimately the driver.
On slide 5, just a couple of points and some things that I think are good with regard to how we're serving our
communities. We were very excited to be the first issuer of a social bond of the US regional bank, $1.25 billion
bond that was well, well received 120 investors very favorable pricing. We're very excited about that in terms of
our ability to focus on affordable housing and other community needs.

We became the lead investor for Greenwood, which was very excited and innovative digital banking platform
designed for Black and Latino consumers and business owners. We signed The Hispanic Promise, a first of its
kind national pledge to prepare, hire, promote, retain, and celebrate Hispanics in the workplace. And we received
100% score on Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. And we were named Best Place to Work in
2021.
We also continued to make great progress in terms of executing on our $60 billion community benefits
agreement. And we already hit 114% of our annual target. We were very proud to be recognized once again by
FORTUNE as one of the world's most admired companies.
On slide 6, just a few indicators for you about how well the merger is going. I just want to point out to you that the
risk of executing our merger has already been reduced substantially and is going down daily as we do
conversions and we're getting a lot of the actual merger work done.
A huge amount of work has already been done on the core bank conversion. And you'll see in the bubble chart
there that a number of conversions has already been done. For example, Truist Securities conversion, wealth
brokerage conversion. We did a huge amount of work in terms of grading all of the Truist jobs and that has all
been executed. We're already in the process of testing protocols for our core bank conversion. Our wealth trust
conversion is well along, occurring in just a few weeks.
So, you can see that we're making tremendous progress. And I just want to emphasize the point that for those
who think that the risk is going to remain high and won't subside until we do the final branch conversion, that is
not a good way to look at it. The risk of being mitigated daily as we do these various conversions and make
progress in terms of preparing for the final conversion.
We did close 226 branches in the first quarter which was part of our strategy. We have been very, very happy with
our teammate reaction to that. They're very, very engaged. Recall that we promised all of our client-facing
performing teammates that they would not lose their jobs. And so, it's going very, very well. And our clients are
very supportive because, remember, most of these branches are very, very close to each other. And so, it's no
inconvenience to our clients. We are very focused on meeting our expense targets which Daryl will talk about.
And we believe we will be able to accomplish that.
Just a few performance highlights on 7 and 8, I think it was a very, very good quarter. We had strong adjusted net
income of $1.6 billion or $1.18 per share adjusted, both up 42% versus the first quarter of 2020. We had adjusted
ROTCE of 19.36%. Recall that we said our mid-term target was in the low 20s, so we are well on the way to
achieving that already. And we have huge cost savings yet to come.
We recorded investment banking and trading income at a record level, along with insurance. It was offset some
by decreases in residential mortgage income and commercial real estate related income. Strong expense
discipline, as our adjusted noninterest expense decreased $57 million most sequentially.
And our merger related and restructuring charges decreased $167 million. We significantly had lower provision for
credit losses of $48 million versus $177 million in the fourth quarter. So, we had a reserve release of $190 million.
Clarke will talk about that more if we have questions.
NPAs decreased $88 million or 6.3%, which we were very happy about. We completed $506 million of share
repurchases. So, we had a total payout for the quarter of about 83%. We did redeem $950 million of preferred

stock during the quarter at an after tax cost of $26 million or $0.02 per share, which was not excluded in terms of
our adjustment to net income.
So, overall, if you look at slide 8, you'll see how the adjustments with the merger-related charges having a diluting
impact of $0.08, incremental operating expenses related to the merger that are not in our ongoing recurring
charges going forward, was $0.10 and an acceleration for cash flow hedge unwind expense of $0.02.
So, overall, it was a very strong quarter across a wide array of performance areas. Importantly, we continue to
execute on our T3 concept, which is the concept of seamless integrating technology and touch, so that we yield a
high level of trust creating a very high value proposition, which is providing excellent client focus, which is
ultimately the most important factor in terms of judging our current and our future performance.
Now, let me turn it to Bill for some additional detail. Bill?

William Henry Rogers, Jr.
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Great, Kelly. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from page 9, our clients continue to adopt
digital at a rapid pace. Since last March, the population of active mobile app users has increased 11% to more
than 4 million users. And that marks an important milestone along our digital journey at the company. We're
absolutely committed to meeting our clients where they are. And increasingly, these interactions are happening in
the digital space.
Our digital commerce data bear this out, as digital client needs met have improved 44% since the first quarter of
2020 and represent more than one-third of total bank production of core bank products. This percentage is even
higher when you include LightStream and mortgage.
As we accompany clients along their digital journey, we often interact with them across multiple digital products
and services. Mobile check deposits and Zelle are two examples; both of which were up significantly from a year
ago, and this just creates additional opportunities to deepen those relationships. Importantly, the increase in
digital transaction activity allows our teammates to spend less time on manual execution and more time assessing
and meeting client needs enabled by our integrated relationship management.
We're also excited about the new Truist digital experience that's rolling out to our clients later this year. In order to
complete the digital migration ahead of the core bank conversion, we're utilizing an innovative proprietary
approach known as a Digital Straddle. The Digital Straddle allows us to migrate clients to the new digital
experience in waves, reducing migration risk, as Kelly discussed earlier, and avoiding a one-time migration early
next year. We recently launched a successful internal pilot of our new digital experience and expect to migrate our
clients on a series of waves during the third and fourth quarter.
Let me now turn to slide 10 and talk about loans. First quarter balance sheet dynamics reflected a combination of
mild loan demand, ongoing government stimulus, and elevated liquidity. Average loans decreased $8.2 billion
compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to a $4.5 billion reduction in commercial balances and $3 billion of
residential mortgage runoff. The decrease in commercial loan balance was primarily attributable to lower revolver
utilization and continued paydown of PPP loans, which outpaced new loan commitments. Approximately $3.3
billion of PPP loans were repaid during the quarter, impacting average commercial balances by $1.8 billion.
Revolver utilization remained low as clients continued to hold elevated liquidity and access to capital markets. In
addition, the dealer floor portfolio continues to experience headwinds related to supply chain disruptions. Average

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
consumer loans decreased $3.6 billion as ongoing refinance activity impacted residential mortgage, home equity,
and direct loan balances. These declines though were partially offset by higher indirect auto balances which
benefited from strong production, especially in the prime segment.
We made a conscious decision in support of our purpose to lean in on PPP loans, and we've been the largest
lender in many of our markets. And while revolver utilization is at an all-time lows, our commitments are steady.
Also acknowledged that our prime mortgage portfolio is more susceptible to higher prepayments. We recognize
these are headwinds, but we're also optimistic that given vaccination rates, government stimulus, and our own
view of productivity and pipelines, all supported economic recovery and corresponding core loan growth.
Let me switch to the next page and talk about deposits. Average deposits increased $7.9 billion sequentially and
are up more than $48 billion from the first quarter of 2020, reflecting government stimulus and pandemic-related
client behaviors. Average balances increased across all deposit categories except time deposits. While the
largest increases were in interest checking and money market and savings, the deposit mix remains favorable as
noninterest bearing accounts represent one third of total deposits.
Truist continues to experience strong deposit growth, while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of
rate paid, as we continue to experience net new household growth. During the first quarter, average total deposits
cost decreased 2 basis points to 5 basis points and average interest bearing deposit costs declined 4 basis points
to 7 basis points. Due to new stimulus, we're up double digits in total deposits since the quarter end.
And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to discuss the overall financial performance.

Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. Continuing on slide 12, net interest income decreased $81 million
linked quarter due to fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion, and lower earning asset yields. Reported
net interest margin was down 7 basis points, reflecting a 4-basis point impact from lower purchase accounting
accretion.
Core net interest margin decreased 3 basis points, as deposit inflows resulted in higher combined Fed balances
and securities. Interest sensitivity decreased slightly as the investment portfolio grew in response to the elevated
liquidity.
Turning to slide 13. Noninterest income decreased $88 million despite record income from insurance and
investment banking and trading. Insurance income increased $81 million linked quarter, reflecting seasonality,
$28 million from recent acquisitions, and $19 million due to a timing change related to certain employee benefit
accounts. Organic revenue grew 6.4% due to strong new business, stable retention and higher property and
casualty rates.
Investment banking and trading rose $32 million, benefiting from strength in high yield investment grade and
equity originations, as well as a recovery in CVA. Residential mortgage income decreased $93 million due to
lower production margins and volumes. Commercial real estate income decreased $80 million due to seasonality
and strong fourth quarter transaction activity. Other income was down $18 million as lower partnership income
was partially offset by gains from a divestiture.
Continuing on slide 14, expense discipline remained strong in the first quarter. Noninterest expense was down
$223 million linked quarter, reflecting $167 million decrease in merger-related and restructuring charges. Adjusted

noninterest expense decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower professional fees and non-service related
pension costs, offset by personnel expense. Personnel expense increased $34 million, reflecting higher equity-
based compensation, higher incentive compensation and payroll tax resets, partially offset by lower salaries and
wages.
Turning to slide 15, we are taking full advantage of our unique opportunity to build the best of both franchise. The
best of both is harder to execute in a typical acquisition, but we are convinced that the client benefits and internal
efficiencies justify the effort and expense.
As we said in January, we continue to expect total combined merger costs of approximately $4 billion. This
consists of merger-related and restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion and incremental operating
expenses related to the merger of approximately $1.8 billion. These costs are not in the future run rate and will
come out in 2022 after we complete the core bank conversion and decommission redundant systems.
Since the merger was announced, we have incurred $1.3 billion of merger-related and restructuring charges and
$900 million incremental operating expenses related to the merger.
Continuing on slide 16, strong asset quality matrix remains relatively stable, reflecting diversification benefits from
the merger and effective problem asset resolution. Nonperforming assets were down $88 million or 2 basis points
as a percentage of total loans, largely driven by decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio.
Net charge-off came in 33 basis points, which was at the lower end of the guidance range. Linked quarter
increase was mostly driven by seasonality in indirect to auto. The provision for credit losses was $48 million,
including a reserve release of $190 million due to lower loan balances and improved economic outlook. The
allowance for credit losses was relatively stable at 2.06% of loans and leases. Our exposure of COVID-sensitive
industries was essentially flat at $27 billion.
Turning to slide 17, Truist has strong capital and ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.1%. With respect
to capital return, we paid a common dividend of $0.45 per share and had $506 million of share buybacks. We also
redeemed $950 million of preferred stock, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.02 per share that
was not excluded from the adjusted results. We have $1.5 billion in repurchase authorization remaining under the
share repurchase program the board approved in December.
We intend to maintain approximate 10% CET1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions, stock repurchases
and changes in risk-weighted assets. As a result, we anticipate second quarter repurchases of about $600 million.
We continue to have strong liquidity and are ready to meet the needs of our clients and communities.
Continuing on slide 18, this slide shows excellent progress towards the net cost saves of $1.6 billion. Through the
first quarter, we reduced sourceable spend 9.3% and are closing in on our 10% target. In terms of retail banking,
we closed 226 branches in the first quarter, bringing the cumulative closures to 374. We are on track to close
approximately 800 branches by the first quarter of 2022.
We reduced our non-branch facilities by approximately 3.5 million square feet and are making progress towards
the overall target of approximately 5 million square feet. Average FTEs are down 9% since the merger
announcement. We expect technology savings of $425 million by the end of 2022 compared to 2019. We
continue to look at these expense buckets and are broadening to look at other across the board. We are highly
committed to our $1.6 billion cost savings target.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Continuing to slide 19, the waterfall on the left shows that we measured core expenses and cost savings.
Beginning with adjusted noninterest expense and then adjusting for the non-qualified plan and the insurance
acquisition expenses, we arrive at a core expense of $3.065 billion. If you adjust for seasonality of high payroll
taxes, equity compensation and variable commissions, core expenses would approach fourth quarter target of
$2.094 billion (sic) [$2.940 billion].
Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 19.36% for the first quarter. We maintained our medium-term
performance and cost saving targets for 2021 and 2022. Further moderation of the merger and economic risk may
enable us to revisit our target CET1 ratio.
Now, I will provide guidance for the second quarter expressed in linked quarter changes. We expect taxable
equivalent revenue excluding security gains to be relatively flat. We expect reported noninterest margin to be
down high single digits driven by a mid-single-digit decrease in core margin and 3 to 4 basis points of purchase
accounting accretion write-off. Noninterest income should be relatively flat due to the growth of the balance sheet.
Noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization expected to be relatively flat. We anticipate net
charge-offs in the range of 30 to 45 basis points and a tax rate between 19% to 20%.
As we look out into 2021, improving economic conditions may allow for further reserve releases. Overall, we had
a strong quarter including excellent expense management and strong asset quality. Now, let me hand it back to
Bill for an update on IRM.

William Henry Rogers, Jr.
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl, and I'm going to take us to page 20. I'm going to take this opportunity to share our progress on
Integrated Relationship Management and share two examples of what we call natural fit businesses working
together to benefit our clients. When Truist was formed, we said we'd create value by combining our distinctive
client-focused banking experiences with greater investment in technology and a stronger mix of financial services
offerings. As Kelly noted earlier, we call this approach T3, touch integrated with technology equals trust.
We're confident in the strategy because it really builds on Truist's strengths. Those strengths include industry-
leading client service and loyalty; an advice-based business model; differentiated offerings including Truist
Securities, Truist Insurance Holdings and the Truist Leadership Institute; and leading technology like our mobile
banking app.
Integrated Relationship Management is a framework for putting T3 into practice across Truist through all of our
lines of businesses, and most importantly, for all of our clients. We start with the client, understand their needs
and engage our business partners through our common technology-based referral and accountability process.
As mentioned, we have natural synergies, which is the relationship between Commercial Community Bank and
Truist Securities. This business is by nature a little lumpy and episodic driven by client needs, but we're very
pleased with our momentum. Referrals are up by a factor of 3 in one year and have more than doubled since the
last quarter. We continue to train bankers and are increasing both in number and quality of referrals. As we share
client wins, teammates gain confidence and motivation to fully leverage all the tools that we have for the benefit of
their [ph] light (00:23:50) clients.
Moving to slide 21, I'll discuss the effort of Truist Securities and Truist Insurance Holdings and the relationship
with heritage SunTrust clients in particular. Referrals to insurance have increased more than 2.3 times compared

Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
to the first quarter of 2020 and more than 50% sequentially. We've aligned systems and trained around similar
practice groups which allows us to double down on industry expertise for our clients.
I can really speak from experience that this was a real area of excitement from heritage SunTrust, and this is
really just in the early stages of growth. So Integrated Relationship Management is working. It's been embraced
fully by our teammates, it's in support of our clients, and a distinguishable benefit for our shareholders. Keep in
mind this is a long game, but you do see the beginning of this incremental opportunity in the overall insurance and
investment banking results even in this quarter.
So, Kelly, let me turn now back over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill. I appreciate that. So on slide 22, I just want to point out and reemphasize our value proposition.
We believe it is a very strong value proposition driven by our purpose to inspire and build better lives and
communities. We have an exceptional franchise with diverse products, services and markets, some of the best in
the world.
We are uniquely-positioned to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns while investing in the future, and you're
seeing that happening already. We have very strong capital and liquidity position, with very strong resilience in
terms of our risk profile enhanced by the merger. So we have a growing earnings stream with less volatility
relative to many of our peers over the long term.
So if you think about the quarter and all – and overall and ramping up, I'll just say, again, I think it was a very
strong quarter. These are very interesting and challenging times, but look, things are getting better, COVID is
getting better. It's too soon to declare that it's over, but hospitalization rates are down and infection rates are down
and vaccines are getting out really, really fast so we're encouraged by that. The economy is clearly improving.
We have said before, and I would reemphasize, we believe as we head into the second half, we will have a
snapback economy. This economy was not wounded before we headed into this, we simply shut it down for
appropriate reasons. Now, we're beginning to see the opportunities that we believe could happen, which is turning
it back on is easier than it might have been on the other types of economic crises that we've seen.
So, Truist is positioned really, really well. We have a great culture. We have great markets. We have a great
team. We have a great purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities, and is creating really engaged
teammates. We have real benefits from the merger that are being realized every single day. You've heard some
of those. We have very strong performance in T3 and IRM as Bill described and that's really powerful.
The merger integration is on track. We are reducing risk every single day. It's all going really, really well. We
believe we have the opportunity to accelerate into what I consider to be a very positive snapback economy. We
fully believe our best days are ahead. Alan?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Kelly, Bill. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you share with us, if you look at the credit outlook for your company and the industry, we've seen an
incredible reduction in the credit cycle because of the policies pursued by the Federal Reserve and the US
government last year. Can you guys give us your thoughts on how you see credit cycles going forward?
Are they permanently potentially flattened because of what we saw last year or is this just such an aberration that
we shouldn't really read into what we're seeing with this lowered, flatter credit cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I would say, and Clarke, he may have some detail on that, Gerard, I don't believe this eliminates ongoing long-
term credit cycles. I mean I think to believe that, you would have to believe that we have somehow fixed the
economy and fixed the nature of humans making decisions and humans getting greedy, and humans indulging in
excesses. I do not believe that has gone away nor will it go away.
Once we flush through these massive amounts of stimulus into the economy, we will undoubtedly see some
excesses. It'll likely lead to some corrections down the road that nobody is projecting now, and I don't project it in
like two or three years, but there will be some excesses created out of all this excessive money into the system.
So, we have had a – heading into the pandemic, we had about a 10-year kind of steady economy. Most people
would say, and including myself, that we were probably heading into correction. Now, we've had what will be two
or three years of COVID experience. We haven't had a [indiscernible] (00:29:36) excesses. That will flow in two or
three years.
So we'll end up with about a 15- or 16-year protracted period of relatively stable [ph] exile (00:29:44), the blip from
COVID, but then we'll go back to fairly normal kind of economic variations in my view.
Clarke, what do you think?

Totally agree. The credit stress was resulting from the shutdown of the economy, not underlying credit
considerations that you would normally see. So we've been around a long time. Credit cycles will come and go.
Lending involves inherent risks. You're going to have a credit cycle in the future so that's why you always have to
stick to your long-term underwriting principles and you can never forget there will be another credit cycle. So I
agree, Kelly.

Gerard, maybe just add to that, is keeping our diversified balance sheet is the key to that. So we're not going to
lose our discipline and [ph] blink (00:30:36) because of this cycle, and we want to anticipate a highly-diversified
business and a strong capital base to fulfill our value proposition.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, your franchise obviously is located in some of the stronger economies in the
US, particularly economies that are more open than some of the coastal economies in the north. Can you share
with us the outlook for, if you look beyond the current quarter and look out into the second half of the year, about
loan growth and loan demand?
I know there's excess of liquidity, you touched on that, Kelly. What do you guys see, the turning points where you
could see an acceleration of loan growth possibly in the third or fourth quarters of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gerard, I'll take that. I think, first of all, what you noted is exactly right about our franchise. I mean I think
whatever happens and whenever it happens, I think we'll be disproportionately positively benefited. So I think we'll
sort of be the first in that cycle. And we see that not only in the face of the markets being more open but just the
migration. I mean the migration of companies and the migration of individuals, I don't think that's quite showing up
in the data yet, but that's got to show up because we absolutely, absolutely feel that.
That being said, if we start – someone's saying the second quarter is the starting period for loan growth, I think it's
reasonable to think that's sort of core loan growth. Let's exclude PPP from that because we're a little over
weighted in PPP, so we've got pay downs related to that. But if we look at core loan growth, I think we have
reason to be positive for the latter part of the year in virtually all of our businesses.

So, maybe CRE [ph] being the lone (00:32:21) example on the opposite side, but core C&I and then the growth in
mortgage, and then businesses like LightStream and indirect auto and others that are more positively inclined. So
I think your general premise is right and I think we are well-positioned, and I think that's a latter half of the year
phenomenon.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. The specific question is, can you give an update on the annualized cost savings as a percentage of the
ultimate target? It was $640 million annualized in the fourth quarter versus the target of $1.6 billion. And along
with that, you're still sticking to $29 billion of expenses by the fourth quarter that's down despite an increase in
volume-based expenses such as for insurance and capital markets. And why is that? And if that's the case, why
wouldn't you be upping your ultimate merger expense saving target?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Mike, that's a great question. If you take our – on the slide that we had in the deck and look at what our
core expenses are, the $3.065 billion, and if you back out the seasonality that we had in the first quarter to the
payroll, tax resets and the equity, that's about $50 million there, we're probably at $3.015 billion, give or take a
little bit there.
We did have higher incentives. Higher incentives this quarter were really driven by our performance in revenues
and just overall great performance throughout the company. So, I kind of carve that out. But, from a core
perspective, I think we continue to make good progress. We are totally committed to getting to the $2.940 billion
that we talked about last quarter. We're on track to get there.
If you noticed in our comments, we said we're looking at these five buckets, but we're also broadening out and
looking at other areas as well. And we are going to hit our targets, for sure, and if we exceed those targets, we will
continue to make good investments in the company to continue to compete and win in the industry.

quarter or no?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
When you say updated it, we really just gave targets for the fourth quarter. It's going to be lumpy, but it's hard to
project a trajectory down every quarter just because of you have a real business that's dynamic and moving, but

we made good progress from fourth quarter to first quarter, and we will get our target by the fourth quarter this
year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And the second question, since insurance is such a standout, I have our firm's insurance analyst, Elyse
Greenspan, to ask the follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elyse Greenspan Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So, I was hoping to get some color within insurance on the organic growth. It's [ph] up to
(00:35:41) 6.4% in the quarter. On the last quarter's call, you guys had pointed to 5% for the first half of the year.
So, I guess what's coming in better than you had expected and how do you see the rest of the year progressing
from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, Elyse. This is Chris Henson. We did have a very exciting organic growth number. The elements of it would
be pricing, retention and new business. So I would say pricing was not a, what I would call a continued surprise.
We bounced – increased around 7%. We think rates are generally going to – we anticipate it to continue
increasing throughout 2021.
Retention, we did level off in retail, so we're just under 91%. We were having a little drift down. As you know,
we're in a – that time of the market, where a lot of that risk gets shifted to the wholesale segment. Wholesale is
actually up to 84.6%. So, retention actually continued to perform just maybe a touch better, but we do continue to
see that shift to wholesale.
New business would be an area I would point to that might have been a brighter spot than we would have seen a
quarter ago. New business production was up 12.8%, which is very solid. And what we saw in the quarter was
every month, that got better. February was better than January, March was better than February, et cetera. And
that's kind of what drove the 6.4% organic.
And I would also piggyback on the comment Bill made earlier, IRM is actually – is real, it's having an impact. And
when we say that they're linked pretty heavily to the Commercial Community Bank, CIG, Wealth, the Retail
Community Bank, we're actually spending time talking about that and making sure we have alignment,
expectations in place, and that's having a marginal impact as well.
In terms of outlook, the second quarter, we'd expect commissions to be up about 3%. We're moving out of the first
quarter which is our second highest quarter of the year into our seasonally strongest which is Q2, and certainly
while there's still uncertainties with COVID and impact it's going to have on the economy, et cetera, we think the
outlook is still very positive in this business, because we think we're going to continue to see increased pricing.
We haven't seen a lot of failures in the business, so we think we're going to continue to see stable exposure units.
E&S volumes are still strong so – and given that we are diversified in both wholesale and retail, it really helps us
in this type of market.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
So, we think pricing momentum will be a [ph] continuing catalyst (00:38:35) for all the reasons we talked about,
COVID, [ph] cap (00:38:38) losses, et cetera. And in this quarter, pricing being up in the 7% range, it was flat with
Q4, we did see an umbrella in excess of 14%, D&O of 11.5%, for example, professional liability up 11%. But
another area where we've been hit disproportionately is commercial property. Commercial property was up 8.5%.
We have a lot of that. That's very helpful to us.
And coverage is all – coverage classes, about half of the coverage classes were up, and all account sizes were
up in the 6.5% to 8.5% kind of range. So, I would say for the next quarter, outlook would be mid-single-digit
organic growth even given the uncertainties. So there, we feel very solid about that as we kind move through. And
we think there's upside in terms of the economy continued benefit to driving even stronger new business. And I
think we continue to mature, as Bill pointed out, with respect to our [ph] earn (00:39:40) process and that gives us
really good positive hope as well.
We did close one small acquisition in the quarter and we certainly expect to be open to do more of those
throughout the balance of the year as well. So on balance, we feel really good about the prospects for the balance
of 2021.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Just the first question, I just wanted to make sure I understood the expense guide for 2Q, because I think you
mentioned, Daryl, relatively flat Q-on-Q and I wanted to understand if that was right and maybe some of the things
that you're thinking about that keep it flat instead of maybe coming down a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Betsy. In my prepared remarks, we did say that we thought expenses was – and the adjusted basis
backing out the merger and restructuring, the incremental MOE, would come in relatively flat. And I think we
continue to make good progress in the buckets that we're showing and we are starting to broaden out in other
areas.

And we will have higher revenue and fees in certain areas just because of seasonal strength in the second
quarter. But net-net, we feel pretty good on how the quarter's going to come in, and from an expense perspective,
I think we're on a good trajectory and we're going to hit our targets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And so you – from what I'm hearing from the prior conversation too is that the expense improvement, acceleration
is picking up as you move through the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
That would be the anticipation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just separately on the revenue side, I know you haven't baked in the revenue synergies, but I just
wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you could speak to what you're seeing so far in terms of picking up
new accounts or expanding the product set of the accounts that you're with relative to what maybe your budgets
or goals have been so far. I know COVID kind of put a wrench in that, but maybe you could speak to how you're
migrating at this stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, it's Bill. I think as I said earlier, you see that in the core results amidst of the penetration that we're
experiencing, the referral volume that we're experiencing. You probably see it most acutely in the results in
investment banking and in insurance, but it's really sort of – look at some of the overall revenue line, it's really
everywhere. I mean, so we've been careful about pointing out one specific revenue synergy against one specific
thing because that's not the goal.
The goal is to expand all of our relationships. The goal is to listen to our clients, put an integrated system
together, have it, the – a highly – technology supported one platform with really good accountability and strong
teammate [indiscernible] (00:42:50). And that's the value proposition. So, I think the real answer is just see it in
the overall results.
Again, I pointed out too that we're more acutely obvious, but literally in all of our businesses, you see the
advantages of what we're implementing as part of the Truist value proposition.

Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
...on to that – so, Betsy, I just want to tag on to say that in the Commercial Community Bank, for example, we saw
referral activity up 15% this past quarter, which is a really good number in household growth and all the
commercial segments. So I think it's a function of what Bill was saying, we're just beginning to see movements
sort of across the board.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Yeah. That was kind of my question, in particular, post – as we've been reopening, do you feel like that has
been picking up, and then I can hear in your answer, it seems like the answer is yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
So, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that – that's the other part of your question, yeah. That's to the – I think we're
again experiencing that a little disproportionately. We're probably leading the country in terms of reopening and
reactivity, and we feel that in virtually all of our business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
We came into the first quarter of last year with a lot of excitement, and then second quarter with COVID, we all
just sort of hit a wall. But the excitement sort of perseveres through the balance of the year and we're just saying,
and I think Bill would agree, just consistent improvement sort of month-on-month.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Okay. All right. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Can you guys talk a bit about your strategy of deploying liquidity in the securities? Last quarter, you purchased
a lot of securities, a little bit less this quarter. What's kind of just the philosophy and capacity as we look forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Right now, Matt, what we are doing is we are investing our excess liquidity that we've gotten in from our
deposits. We're averaging about $20 billion at the Fed which we think is a comfortable cushion to basically handle
any volatility we might get there. The investments we're making is a combination of mortgage-backed securities
and US Treasuries.
We are averaging up a little bit on the yields that we have on the portfolio that we have out there today from that
perspective. I think the way we think about it is we're going to have a liquidity for a fair amount of time and we're
going to have cash flows. And kind of dovetailing into what Bill said earlier, that the best thing that could happen
16


Truist Financial Corp.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
to us is loan growth starts to pick up second quarter into the second half of the year when we basically – basic –
run off some securities that are in the mid-1% ranges and we reinvest them into loans in the 2% to 4%, 5% or 6%
range and basically keep the balance sheet about the same size and just improve our revenue and earnings
overall. So, I think that would be the strategy for us to do that.
If, for whatever reason, that the Fed starts to shrink their balance sheet and liquidity comes out, you got to
remember, we have $8 billion to $10 billion of cash flows coming off this portfolio every quarter that we can
absorb anything. So, I think, we're taking good balance risks. Our target right now is to keep net interest income,
even with a runoff of purchase accounting flat for the next several quarters. And, hopefully, that will pick up
towards the end of the year, as we get meaningful loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then I just want to follow-up on the last question, [indiscernible] (00:46:41) question regarding
revenue synergies. I understand kind of pushing at all the businesses and not trying to necessarily kind of track it
separately. But as we think longer-term and the opportunities become a little more apparent and, I guess, I'm
thinking loan growth picks up and there's some loans that legacy BBT offered that SunTrust didn't and vice versa.
It would seem like the numbers could start being a little more material. And I do want to see if, over time you
might provide more details on the magnitude of the synergies. So far you've talked about kind of capital market
sizing for that in the fourth quarter. But bringing it all together over time, is that something you'd consider?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Matt, I think we will definitely do that. We're trying to provide, you know, timely information on the most marginally
important issues. But as Bill and Chris illustrated, we really have a broad-based opportunity, not just loan
deposits, all types of fee income. We are really just scratching the surface. The reason we keep emphasizing this
[ph] IRM (00:47:53) concept is because that is the most powerful concept, and we think we have an edge on that
because it focuses on all of the client's needs, all of the time. We build a culture where everybody works together.
We build systems to allow for information to be integrated across organizational boundaries. And so, yes, you're
right, I think you can be positive in terms of expected revenue enhances as we go forward as we begin to
penetrate more of our client's needs.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
My first question is, as we think about the prospects for loan growth bouncing back for the rest of the year, could
you remind us how many of your clients are either non-investment grade or don't have a debt rating? I guess the
big struggle investors have is the capital markets are wide open, private equity firms continue to be aggressive in
private credit, and sort of wondering, what that universe is of your clients that potentially would need a bank
balance sheet in order to expand?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, this is Bill. The key is to have a really balanced portfolio. So, we have a good number of clients who
won't access the capital markets. That's sort of that core strength of that middle market community banking
model. And they'll use bank loans as their primary avenue for growth.
Then you see the other side of that. I don't think that's the only equation. If rates go up, certainly, on the long end,
you can see large corporates going back to bank loans. They are the most efficient way of borrowing. We've got a
lot of revolvers out. Just a little bit of revolver utilization increase is a pretty significant loan driver for us.
So, I don't think we necessarily think about it as the non-investment grade and the investment grade in terms of a
separation. We think about it in terms of the balanced portfolio, and we drive it from the client needs. So, if the
client wants capital markets, and that's the most efficient way, we have great access and great capability and
great products. For those that want to have a bank product, we've got a great portfolio of those type middle
market clients and we're able to serve them. So, I think our optimism is really predicated on just this concept of a
balanced portfolio, one versus the other. Does that make sense?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, it does. And I think, Bill, that's a great point on long rates rising and revolvers becoming more attractive. I
think that point hasn't been made as vocally. So, thank you for that. And the follow-up question is clearly
consumers and corporates are awash with cash. Do you expect that those cash balances have to be drawn
before corporates especially re-lever, or are your clients telling you that they're going to keep a little bit more cash
on hand given what they went through during the pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Erika, I think everybody is trying to figure out the answer to that question. You've got consumer and business. I'll
comment on business and Chris can comment on consumer. I think what you're going to see is that businesses
are going to end up maintaining more liquidity than you would expect as they began to weigh in on new credit
facilities, whether it's capital markets or whether it's bank balance sheets.
And the reason is because I think you're going to see leaders of businesses that were very unnerved with the
Great Recession, and then just a few years later got very unnerved with the COVID experience. The end result of
that is going to be psychologically a very reserved view that argues for maintaining liquidity even as you're
borrowing. So, I personally expect that you're going to see borrowing increase faster than most people expect as
we head into the latter part of this year and still maintain liquidity.

Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Erika, for consumer, what we're seeing right now is checking balances are about 30% higher and savings
balances are up 140%. Obviously, a lot of that is driven by stimulus. But, for lending to occur, there's got to be
demand. And I think we are seeing spending now on nondiscretionary type things which – I mean, discretionary
type of things, excuse me. And I think when cash depletes, there will be more lending. But it is tough today for
home equity type products as a result of all the stimulus.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on the fee income side, I think embedded within your
kind of flat revenues and flattish NII, kind of flattish fees. And Chris had talked about the plus 3-ish-percent
outlook for insurance. So just wanted to understand and given that there was a gain in there too this quarter, just
what are some of the other moving parts of fees as you look outward? Daryl, you had sounded very optimistic at
the beginning of the year about the outlook for fees. I'm just wondering what you think continues to be the other
positives and then some things that might be settling back out off of recent strength. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ken. From a fee perspective, I think insurance, as Chris said, will have its largest quarter of the year in the
second quarter. So that will be strong. Second quarter activity is usually strong in the payments area and activity.
So I think all those will be relatively strong. I think we're calling for tighter margins in the mortgage area so that,
even though we'll have higher volumes, we might have lower revenues there potentially.
And then if you look into investment banking and trading areas, we did have a CVA adjustment this past quarter.
For that to continue, we'd have to have rates continue going up. We don't really have a good prediction if rates
are going to go up or not, export or not. So, we're just kind of saying that's relatively flat. They do have strong
pipelines though in the M&A area and other pieces. So, net-net, I think they'll still be strong, but CVA was a
benefit for us this past quarter.
But I think, overall, Ken, we feel pretty good about fees. And right now, we're staying relatively flat and we'll just
see how the quarter unveils and, hopefully, we can beat that performance.

Got it. Great. And secondly, you've teased out before this potential to relook at that 10% CET1 and obviously
getting through the rest of the pandemic would probably be priority one. But what are the other factors that you
need to continue to evaluate that? And could it be a big delta or are you talking about just modest changes as you
continue to tighten up on what this company looks like over the long term? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Ken, you've heard us say that the relationship between capital and risk is what drives our capital
decisions. Going into the merger and up to the current moment, we've judged that the risk externally were
substantial. We judged that the risk of making sure we do the merger right were material. And so, as we look
forward, what we see is that the risk externally are mitigating, COVID is mitigating, economic risks are mitigating.
So, assuming that it's not some huge existential event that we don't anticipate, the external factors are mitigating
meaningfully. Internally, as I described earlier, the risks are reducing daily. And so, it does set forward the
opportunity for us to have some capital actions that can be attractive to our shareholders.
It's hard to judge right now the materiality of that because you literally have to take it a day at a time. One thing we
should have all learned is the projecting out in this kind of environment six months or nine months now is just not
rational. And so, you have to kind of take it more carefully. But as we do, as we see risk began to continue to
materially mitigate, we do have meaningful opportunity in terms of capital deployment.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On the margin front, I know you guided to some incremental compression in the second quarter and then in the
fourth quarter saw a bit greater pressure than expected, I think. How should we think about a bottoming of the
margin? When do you think that can materialize? You expect that from the third quarter and maybe give us some
thoughts around what could drive that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, so if you look at margin – and I'll start off with our core margin. Core margin was 2.69%. We're
guiding that to be down mid-single digits. So, I think we'll stay in the 2.60s. Given what we know – it's really a
20

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
function – this is like as hard as it's ever been and trying to forecast actually a margin number out because of all
this excess liquidity going on and what's happening with the loan portfolio and all that.
That said, we expect to get more deposit growth as the stimulus plays out. That's going to continue to put
pressure on core margin. No matter what we do with those funds right now until loan volume picks up, we're either
going to put it at the Fed or we're going to invest the dollars. So, our core margin is coming down.
We believe that we can probably stay in the 2.60s for most of this year, hopefully. And if, as loans pick up in the
second half of the year, we might be in the higher range of 2.60s. But right now, I will just say mid to lower 2.60s.
And then if you just look at the GAAP or reported margin, we are running off a purchase accounting accretion. It's
about 3 or 4 basis points a quarter is what it's been doing the last couple of quarters. That will continue. So, we're
at 3.01%, and you adjust for core coming down and then you take 3 or 4 basis points down, that will come down,
probably end up in the 2.80s, give or take, by the end of the year depending on what happens with the accretion
runoff.
But that said, and I think the important thing there is that we are focused on managing NII, and we're guiding for at
least flat, if not better, than flat NII as the year plays out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks, Daryl. That's helpful. And then separately, on the loan growth front, you mentioned a couple
of times now the likely inflection in loan growth ideally in the back half of the year, it seems like, maybe if you
could help us think about that, the pace of growth that could materialize in the back half. And more importantly,
what type of loan growth is fair to assume as we look going into 2022, talking about the low-single-digit pace as
being reasonable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, as Kelly noted earlier, I mean, it's hard to project out a lot of months here, because there are a lot of
binary events that are going on. But we just look at things like pipelines, we look at things like productions, we
look at things like the impacts of those. So, I do think – if you look at overall and think about core and think about
that base, I mean, we're talking about single-digit kind of growth through the latter part of the year.
The things that could influence that more would be, as I mentioned earlier, revolver utilization changing, things
like that. But I think when we look at sort of the core growth part, I would think, sort of, averaging single-digits.
And then, of course, for us, you just have to remember, we have a little bit of that PPP headwind in the total loan
growth. But we really think about, sort of, core second half of the year, some type of single-digit opportunity.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2021
Thanks. Good morning. Kelly and Bill, I wanted to follow up on your ESG commentary in the release. How have
your discussions evolved with different stakeholders? Are the investments you're making in ESG a source of
differentiation? Or are they table stakes? And how are you thinking about the financial impact of ESG?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we feel very good about the long-term financial impacts of ESG. It's clearly the right thing to do for our
communities, for the economy at large. To be honest, it's bumpy right now for all of us to figure out what the near-
term economic impacts are because we're all fairly new at this. But there's no doubt that the long-term economic
impacts will be very positive, not to mention the quality of life and the future for our kids and our grand-kids. And
so, we're really committed to a very aggressive and broad-based ESG program.
You've just seen a lot of things we do. And like our social bond, Daryl has done a lot of things already in terms of
bringing our environment. We have lots more plans as we go down the road. So, it's something that we all in the
corporate community need to be highly invested in, Truist is. I think it's net accretive long term. In the short term, it
could be a little bumpy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think as Kelly said, I mean, we view it collectively as an opportunity versus a requirement. And I think
that's how we want to think about it. And I think our teammates have embraced that. And I think there are things
that will just make us a better company and a better society.

That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may as a follow-up, a separate question for Daryl. Could you give some
additional thoughts around the variability on either side of around the $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of merger costs
on slide 15, with seven quarters to go through 2022, how do you think about the potential for these to come in
either better or worse? Any perspective there would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Bill, I would tell you we're on track of getting about $4 billion. Last year, we did about $1.3 billion. And if you add
the two numbers together, this year we'll probably be $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion as well this year as the numbers
come through, and then we'll finish out and get the rest in 2022. So, I think we're just on track right now. Our main
focus, to be honest with you, is to really do a great job on the convergence to make sure everybody has a really
positive client experience. That would be the best outcome of all and [ph] what the cost portion (01:03:25) that we
have in there should be able and enable that to happen.

Very helpful. Thank you.

Operator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for
any additional or closing remarks.
