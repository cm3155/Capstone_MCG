Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good evening, and thank you for joining us today. I've spent a lot of time in these last few weeks in front of our
advisors. First traveling with our top-producing independent advisors on a great trip, great to see the success in
their business and the positive nature of how they feel about the firm. And then, attending our RCS conference,
our RIA division and clearing firm. Again, that division's over 10% of our Private Client Group assets now. And it's
great to see the growth and the enthusiasm there also.
Now turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment, which included a regional banking crisis,
heightened volatility and rapidly rising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the last
fiscal year. That's our third consecutive year of record results in very different market environments, was achieved
by staying true to our core. We put clients first. We act with integrity. We value independence and think long term.
These core values are more than words on a page. They are lived day in and day out by our advisors and
associates. This dedication and focus provides stability during tough economic times, and what makes me
confident about our continued success in the future.
Reviewing fourth quarter results starting on slide 4, the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $3.05
billion, and net income available to common shareholders of $432 million or $2.02 per diluted share. Excluding
expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $457 million or
$2.13 per diluted share. The increase in Asset Management revenues and interest-related revenues drove
significant revenue growth over the prior year, with net revenues increasing 8%.
Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters, including an
incremental $55 million provision related to the previously disclosed SEC industry sweep on off-platform
communications. This provision resulted in an impact during the quarter of $0.26 per diluted share. We generated
strong returns for the fiscal fourth quarter with an annualized return on common equity of 17.3%, and annualized
adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.2%, a great result, particularly given our strong capital base.
Moving on to slide 5. The year-over-year client asset growth was strong, driven by organic growth and all of our
affiliation options along with market appreciation. We ended the quarter with a total client assets under
administration of $1.26 trillion, PCG-based assets in fee-based accounts of $683 billion, and financial assets
under management of $196 billion. With our continuing focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality
financial advisors, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this year with
domestic net new assets of $14.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 5% annualized growth rate on
beginning of the period domestic PCG assets.
For the fiscal year, domestic net new assets of $73 billion reflected a 7.7% annual growth rate, which is a leading
result in the industry. During the fiscal year, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee
channels, financial advisors with approximately $250 million of trailing 12 production, and nearly $38 billion of
3

client assets of their previous firms. These results do not include our RIA and Custody Services business, RCS,
which had another strong year in recruited results.
More importantly, we continue to maintain a very low regrettable attrition levels of financial advisors of about 1%.
These factors contributed to our annual NNA growth of 7.7%. Total clients' domestic sweep and Enhanced
Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $56 billion, down 3% compared to June of 2023. The Enhanced
Savings Program with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance coverage continued to attract significant
cash this quarter, partially offsetting a decline in client sweep balances, largely due to quarterly fee billings and
cash sorting activity. Total bank loans increased 1% from the preceding quarter to $44 billion, reflecting muted
loan demand to our target markets, given rising rates and the macroeconomic uncertainty.
Moving on to slide 6. Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.27 billion
and pre-tax income of $477 million. Year-over-year, results were lifted by strong asset-based revenues and the
benefit of higher interest rates on interest-related revenues and fees. The Capital Markets segment generated
quarterly net revenues of $341 million, and a pre-tax loss of $7 million. Revenue declined 15% compared to the
prior-year quarter, mostly driven by lower fixed income brokerage and investment banking revenues. However,
we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in M&A and advisory revenues this quarter. Additionally, our
public finance business had improved results with debt underwriting growing 32% sequentially.
The extremely challenging market environment, particularly for investment banking has strained the near-term
profitability of segment results. And as we explained previously, the segment results are negatively impacted by
amortization of share-based compensation from prior years, as well as growth investments. We remain focused
on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $100 million, and net revenues of $236 million.
The increases in net revenues and pre-tax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher
assets in PCG fee-based accounts at the beginning of a quarterly billing period, and strong net flows in Raymond
James Investment Management, which generated $920 million (sic) [$921 million] (00:09:33) of net inflows during
the fiscal fourth quarter, and $2.2 billion of net inflows in the fiscal year.
The Bank segment generated net revenues of $451 million, and pre-tax income of $78 million. Fourth quarter NIM
for the Bank segment of 2.87% declined 4 basis points compared to a year-ago quarter and 39 basis points
compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to a higher-cost mix of deposits. We continued to add diverse
higher-cost funding sources with our Enhanced Savings Program, and consequentially shifted more of the lower-
cost suite funding to third-party banks. In a few minutes, Paul Shoukry will discuss this further. While this
negatively impacted the Bank segment NIM, there is an offset in higher RJBDP third-party bank fees. So, still a
net positive for the firm overall, while also providing advisors an attractive deposit alternative to offer their clients.
Looking at fiscal 2023 results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $11.6 billion, and record net
income available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, up 6% and 15%, respectively, over the prior year's
records. Additionally, we generated strong returns on common equity of 17.7%, and adjusted returns on tangible
common equity of 22.5% for the fiscal year.
On slide 8, the strength of the PCG and Bank segments for the fiscal year primarily reflects the benefit of strong
organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital, and the benefit from
higher short-term interest rates. When compared to the record activity levels in the year-ago period, weaker
Capital Markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage
revenues, despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition, which we completed in June of 2022.

And now, I will turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting on slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $3.05 billion in the fourth quarter,
up 8% over the prior year, and 5% sequentially. Asset management and related administrative fees grew 12%
compared to the prior-year quarter, and 5% sequentially due to the higher assets in fee-based accounts at the
end of the preceding quarter. This quarter, fee-based assets declined 2%, which will be a headwind for our asset
management and related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.
Brokerage revenues of $480 million were flat year-over-year, and increased 4% sequentially. Year-over-year, the
lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment were offset by higher brokerage revenues
in PCG. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of
$202 million declined 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, the 34% increase was driven predominantly by higher
M&A and advisory revenues, as well as a solid quarter for public finance. We are cautiously optimistic that the
environment for M&A is improving, and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new
business activity.
However, there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deals launching and closing, given the
heightened market volatility and geopolitical concerns. So, while we may not see a significant improvement in the
next fiscal quarter, we are hoping for better results over the next 6 to 12 months. Other revenues of $54 million
were down 33% compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower revenues from affordable housing
investments. The pipeline for that business remains strong, but several closings slipped to fiscal 2024 due to
higher interest rates.
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$56.4 billion, down 3% compared to the preceding quarter, and representing 5.1% of domestic PCG client assets.
Advisors continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. The Enhanced
Savings Program grew approximately $2.4 billion in deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming
into ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisors, highlighting the attractiveness of this product, and
Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.
As many eligible clients have now taken advantage of this product, the pace of flows into the Enhanced Savings
Program has understandably decelerated. Through Monday of this week, sweep and ESP balances are down
approximately $620 million for the month of October, as growth in ESP balances was more than offset by the
quarterly fee billings as expected. We continue to believe we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic
than we are to the beginning. However, until rates stabilize, we would not be surprised to see further yield-seeking
behavior by clients.
Sweep balances with third-party banks were $15.9 billion at the quarter-end, giving us a large funding cushion
when attractive growth opportunities surface. The strong growth of Enhanced Savings Program balances at
Raymond James Bank has allowed for more balances to be deployed off-balance sheet. While this dynamic has
negatively impact the Bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower-cost sweep balances being
swept off-balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution, while also optimizing the
firm's funding flexibility. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Turning to slide 12. Combined net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $711 million, nearly
flat from the immediately preceding quarter as a sequential decrease in firmwide net interest income was offset by
higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks. If you recall, on our last earnings call, we anticipated a 5% sequential
decline in these interest-related revenues. So, we are pleased with the better-than-expected result, which was
partly a function of higher-than-anticipated yields on RJBDP third-party balances.
The Bank segment's net interest margin decreased 39 basis points sequentially to 2.87% for the quarter, while the
average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 23 basis points to 3.6%. While there are many
variables that will impact actual results, absent any changes to short-term interest rates, we currently expect
combined net interest income in RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal first
quarter as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter. And that's just based on spot balances after the fee billings this
quarter.
As experienced over the past two quarters, this guidance may prove to once again be conservative if cash sweep
balances stabilize around current levels and/or if the Bank assets grow more than anticipated during the rest of
the quarter. But as we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing NIM over the near term, we are
more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long term, which
we believe we are still well-positioned to do.
As many of you may recall, our expectation has always been that the industry would over-earn an interest income
early on in a rising rate environment, and then experience some normalization of interest earnings as clients
redeploy their cash to higher-yielding alternatives.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13. Compensation expense was $1.89 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 62%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 61.4% during the quarter,
which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for Capital Markets. Non-
compensation expenses of $576 million increased 1% sequentially. As Paul Reilly mentioned earlier, the fiscal
fourth quarter included the incremental provision related to the previously disclosed SEC industry sweep on off-
platform communications of $55 million, resulting in an impact during the quarter of $0.26 per diluted share.
Combined with the provision in the fiscal third quarter, we are confident that we are now fully reserved for this
matter. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $36 million increased $2 million over the prior-
year quarter, and decreased $18 million compared to the preceding quarter. I'll discuss more related to the credit
quality in the Bank segment shortly.
In summary, while there has been some noise with elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters this year,
adjusted non-compensation expenses, excluding loan loss provision and those legal and regulatory provisions,
came in very close to our annual expectation of $1.7 billion, reinforcing that we remain focused on managing
expenses, while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients.
Slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pre-tax
margin of 19.2%, and adjusted pre-tax margin of 20.3%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges
impacting Capital Markets in the aforementioned legal and regulatory provision.
On slide 15, at quarter-end, total assets were $78.4 billion, a 1% sequential increase. Liquidity and capital remain
very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well-above our $1.2 billion target.
The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.9%, and total capital ratio of 22.8% are both more than double the regulatory
requirements to be well-capitalized. The 11.9% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects nearly $1.5 billion of excess capital

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
above our conservative 10% target, which would still be 2 times more than the regulatory requirement to be well-
capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in
growth. We also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility,
and nearly $9.5 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the fiscal year, the firm
repurchased 8.35 million shares of common stock for $788 million, an average price of $94 per share. As of
October 25, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the board's approved common stock
repurchase authorization. While we didn't complete any repurchases in the fourth quarter due to self-imposed
restrictions, just to be prudent, given our knowledge of the aforementioned SEC off-platform matter, we remain
committed to our planned repurchases to offset dilution from the TriState Capital acquisition and the share-based
compensation as we previously discussed.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total
loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.17%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage
of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.07%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on
corporate loans as a percent of total corporate loans held for investment was 2.03% at quarter-end.
We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of
inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates, and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio.
Given industry-wide challenges, we continue to closely monitor the commercial real estate portfolio and, more
specifically, the office portfolio. We have prudently limited the exposure to office loans, which represents just 3%
of the Bank segment's total loans.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I said from the start of the call, I am pleased with our results for the fiscal 2023, and our
ability to generate record earnings, even in challenging market conditions. The record results this fiscal year once
again highlight the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses. And while there is still near-term
economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength, and are well-positioned to drive growth over the
long term across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be negatively
impacted by the 2% sequential decline in assets in fee-based accounts.
Near term, we expect some headwinds to interest-sensitive earnings at both PCG and the Bank segment given
ongoing cash sorting activity. However, I am optimistic we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as
current and prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values, and leading technology and product
solutions. Our advisor recruiting activity has picked up significantly over the last two months with record numbers
of large teams in the pipeline.
In the Capital Markets segment, as we saw this quarter, there are some signs of improvement in investment
banking, and we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there's still
reason for optimism, we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions,
and would expect activity to likely pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
And in the fixed income space, the dynamic for the last year persists. Depository clients are experiencing
declining deposit balances, and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our
brokerage activity. We hope once rates and cash balances stabilize, we can start to see an improvement. So,
while there are some near-term challenges, we believe the Capital Markets business is well-positioned for growth,
given the investments we've made over the past five years, which have significantly increased our productive
capacity and market share.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal quarter down 2%
compared to the preceding quarter, which should create a headwind to revenue. We remain confident that strong
growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of
financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help
drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, operational and marketing synergies.
In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and
prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate, and
are starting to experience growth. We expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with
the current level of rates. With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However,
spreads have improved, and with ample cash sitting on third-party banks and lots of capital, we are well-
positioned to lend once activity increases.
In closing, entering fiscal 2024, we believe our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses, along with
our ample capital and liquidity has us well-positioned to drive future growth. I want to thank our advisors and
associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and
every day, especially in uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most. Thank you for all you do.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line
is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Was hoping you could expand upon the record backlog you talked about for advisors joining your
platform, maybe some context around the size and scope of that. And also, it seems like there is more industry
movement. You mentioned attrition being very low for the year. Just wondering if you're seeing any uptick in terms
of attrition across your platform more recently, as you mentioned, more advisor movement across the industry?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Okay. Well, good question. I think that first, the attrition still stayed around 1%. That's slightly up from last year,
but it's the same ballpark kind of rounding. So, we're happy to see that given the market's been very, very
competitive. If you look at industry data, advisor movement is down about 15%, industrywide, if you believe the
data. But what we're seeing in terms, what we're not seeing in number of advisors, we're seeing in size of team.
So, just last month, we added a bank platform in $3 billion in assets, 27 advisors.
And when we look at the backlog, especially in the last two months, the number of teams that are generating $10
million to $20 million of revenue, we've never had so many come through at once. So, that has been a really big
pick-up that – and the pipeline, not saying we're going to close them all, but we've never had this many at one
time where we're down to the final kind of negotiating line, so, as well as people that have committed, we haven't
announced. So, it's been a pick-up from a little slower activity. But I would say that between last year and this
year, it's just last year it was larger teams at the end, this year, it's just significant number of very large teams that
are in the pipeline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a question, as you think about this coming fiscal year and expenses, if the
Capital Markets activity remains somewhat depressed or around these levels, should we think about non-comp
expense or I guess how should we think about non-comp expense and levers that you think or you're looking to
pull to potentially improve the profitability and/or even maintain profitability in a more challenged revenue
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, for the Capital Markets specifically, most of the expenses are comp expenses. And we had
continued to invest in that business, even through this difficult environment, we were opportunistic, as we
explained in our Analyst Day in adding about a dozen MDs particularly to our healthcare group and other groups.
So, we're still investing in the business long term. We think it's attractive. We have a great platform there.
Really if you look at the losses that [indiscernible] (00:32:47) segment generated this year, about $150 million of it
or $135 million of it or so was related to growth expenses and retention expense, deferred comp expenses that
9

were advertising throughout the year. So, more than the entire loss of the segment was really growth related or
deferred comp related. So, overall, the firm non-compensation expenses, we expect will continue to grow. We
managed them very well this year. I talked about excluding the legal and regulatory and the loan loss provision,
very close to that $1.7 billion target we laid out a year ago. And we expect it to continue growing from this level
because a lot of those costs are growth expenses, whether it would be the FDIC insurance expense as we
continue to put more deposits at the bank, et cetera.
So, they were negatively impacted this year by the legal and regulatory after a very benign year last year. But net-
net, we would continue to expect non-compensation expenses to grow, while also being very focused on
managing the controllable expenses that we can manage while still ensuring high support levels for advisors and
their clients.

Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. So, just with the nearly $1.5 billion of excess capital above that 10% target, you mentioned the
suspension of repurchases in the quarter due to knowing about the regulatory matter. I guess when we think
about the pace of repurchases in fiscal 2024, Paul, should we still think about that $300 million to $350 million per
quarter run rate, or should we expect a little bit of a catch-up given there were no repurchases last quarter and
given how much excess capital you have on the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think when you think about excess capital, I would just start with capital prioritization framework that we've
been following almost since our inception, really, which is first and foremost to use the excess capital to invest in
growth. So, Paul talked about the prospects that we have for organic growth, which we're pretty bullish on right
now, just given the pipelines, not only in PCG but really across our businesses. And then, we're also active on the
acquisition front, looking at opportunities that are good cultural fit first and foremost, but that would also be good
strategic fit, and pricing across all M&A right now is challenging because there are gaps between buyers and
sellers. But we feel like we can, through continued dialogue, find good opportunities there over time.
And then, to the extent that we can invest the capital in growth and we have this our ongoing dividend, which is
20% to 30% of earnings, and then buybacks, and we do have to play some catch-up on the buyback since we
didn't do any this quarter, I think we'd have about $250 million more to offset the issuance associated with
TriState acquisition and two years of share-based compensation. So, we'll get back to doing that. And then, we
have a commitment to offset dilution going forward, which is about $200 million a year. But if we have the excess
capital, which we currently have and we deem the price to be attractive, then we would obviously be opportunistic
above and beyond that offsetting of dilution.

Great. Thank you. And then, just for a follow-up, just want to touch on the admin comp line within the PCG
segment moved lower sequentially in the quarter, came in a bit lower than expected. I guess if we take a step
back and look at the full year, that admin comp grew by more than 15%, which is a similar rate to fiscal 2022,
although I think there were some acquisitions in there and some unusual or higher-than-expected raises that went
into effect over that period. I guess as we look out to fiscal 2024 or over the medium term is how should we think
about growth in that admin comp line on a normalized basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Hey, you touched on it. I mean, that 16% growth in PCG admin comp does include growth investments, full year
of Charles Stanley is in there, as well as all of the support staff for all of the advisors that we bring on-board that
their compensation goes into the admin comp as well. So, we've invested in the platform, and this year we added
on top of that, as you pointed out, we are very generous in passing on the financial success with associates in the
form of higher raises last year. And that's reflected in these numbers as well. Looking forward, we are again
focused on – while expecting continued growth in this line item, certainly we'd expect it to sort of be a reduction in
the growth rate from what we experienced this year given the aforementioned factors.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Rubin Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. This is Ben Rubin filling in for Brennan. Thank you for taking my question. I first want to ask about the
composition of the loan book. We did see some growth in the loan book in the balance sheet for the first time in
several quarters. And I guess my first question is, how are you thinking about balance sheet growth on the loan
side in fiscal year 2024, maybe on commercial versus consumer underwriting? And then also, what type of
balance sheet growth does your NII guide interpret as we look to next quarter? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The near-term NII guide factors in very modest loan growth, just given the environment still in terms of the
demand being pretty muted, particularly on the corporate side now. But we were pleased to see the growth during
the quarter, and a lot of it was driven by securities-based loans and residential mortgages. And while we expect
mortgage volumes to decelerate, given much higher rates now, we are optimistic about the securities-based loan
portfolio in both Raymond James Bank and TriState as we look forward over the next 12 months, and that's based
on two factors.
The first is the repayments of those balances have really stabilized as you would expect accelerated significantly
as rates were rising, almost doubling in some cases over the last 12 months. And so, that has stabilized, and we
are starting to see new originations. And on the TriState Capital side, a lot of benefit from what they call
transitions or essentially existing clients bringing on and recruiting new advisors. So, we are optimistic about that
portfolio going forward over the next 12 months.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I would just add, we are open for business. We have more than adequate cash in the buffer, and certainly the
capital. And it's really just the loan demand. So, hopefully the SBLs continue to go from being repaid to starting to
grow as we saw the indication last quarter. The mortgage business is obviously slow. And the commercial loans,
we're open to it, but it's a very slow market, and the spreads are widening for the deals that are coming out. But
again, it's more of a muted market. So, you saw this quarter, we're open for business. We have to find the loans
that we're comfortable with, so.

Benjamin Rubin Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. That's very helpful. And then, for my follow-up, I'll kind of touch back on what Dan's first question about net
new assets. So, net new asset growth in the quarter was 5%. It's a bit below the high-single-digit percentages you
guys have been printing in recent years. I was just wondering if you can give me some color if there was any
noise, any advisor departures that were lumpy that may have impacted the quarter, and whether or not this, let's
call it, mid-single-digit range is more appropriate, or should we kind of – is it some revert back to the high-single
digits once the advisor market if it does improve from here? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think for the quarter, I mean, it's been a dynamic year in a lot of ways in terms of as you look at advisor count, I
think that we had one program which we previously talked about that we exited. From the platform, we kept 60%
of advisors, 40% left, and it cost us $4.6 billion in assets and 60 advisors, but we think from a profitability and long
term, it was the right program. If you look just this month, again adding a $3 billion bank program and 27 advisors
just among the crew, a lot of big projects like that. So, we're still optimistic whether we can hit to double-digit suite
in a couple of quarters, that's a big number depending on the markets. But we expect to do very, very well. But
that'll be up to kind of recruiting and what happens to the Capital Markets, so [indiscernible] (00:42:42).

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. So, wanted to start off with a question on spread revenue. Came in better than your guidance in the quarter.
It also trended better than what we saw at some of your peers. And given you have a larger proportion of client
cash that swept to third-party banks, to what extent did the spread revenue benefit from improved pricing from
those partner banks provide any incremental boost? We know banks are seeking out alternative sources of
liquidity. There's a lot of demand for that. Whether you benefited from any improved pricing on some of those
third-party sweeps?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think our better performance than many peers is really just a reflection of our long-term focus of kind of
maintaining a flexible approach that's focused on giving clients as much FDIC insurance as possible. And you see
that with the growth in Enhanced Savings Program balances, which give us more flexibility in that dry powder that
effectively puts more sweep balances with third-party banks as we await growth of the bank's balance sheet, as
Paul discussed earlier.
And that dynamic, as you point out, Steve, is absolutely correct. The demand from third-party banks is only
increasing by the week. And as contracts renew, we are able to renew at more favorable terms. So, that played a
role. But bigger picture, what really played a role was us just maintaining that sort of long-term flexible approach
to managing the balance sheet, and offering clients as much FDIC coverage as we possibly can through our
various products.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And for my follow-up, wanted to drill down in terms of some of the October deposit trends, Paul, that
you had cited. Given the sensitivity of spread revenue to changes in deposit mix, I was hoping you could provide
some additional granularity disaggregating the sweep and ESP deposit levels, and maybe help size the impact of
the advisor payout.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
When you say the advisor payout, are you referring to the quarterly fee billings or what do you...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Quarterly fee billings, which honestly I care less about that. I really just was hoping to get the ESP and sweep
deposit levels...

Paul Shoukry A

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Got it. Yeah. So, we were down as of couple of days ago $600 million. But this does bounce around from day to
day. I mean, we had a $200 million positive day yesterday, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
At quarter-end, we had a $500 million day. So, the balances are at numbers we're not used to, high and low
coming in and out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
The Enhanced Savings Program is up probably $200 million to $300 million so far this month. And so, the offset
to that would obviously be the sweep balances, which frankly are doing much better than we would have
expected, given that we had the quarterly fee billings earlier this month as well.
So, net-net, for cash to be down $500 million to $600 million when you add those two components, considering
the $1.2 billion of quarterly fee billings, we're pretty pleased with our situation right now. But again, day to day
could change today or tomorrow. So, we're going to monitor it closely.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The important thing for us. I mean just not on earnings, but the fact that we have so much money to third-
party banks that we could use if we wanted it. And we really [indiscernible] (00:46:58) haven't been borrowing. So,
we have a lot of comfort to be able to go ahead and still have all the flexibility we need. But there has been the
mix change with ESP with higher deposit costs, and that's what you've been seeing net-net.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could provide us with some more color around deposit cost
mix, and specifically the pick-up in money market and savings account yields.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think we just sort of covered the growth in the Enhanced Savings Program balance. For us, I mean, in
terms the deposit costs, that is the biggest factor because that does cost somewhere around 5%. And so, to the
extent that the mix of the total client cash balances shift to those Enhanced Savings Program balances, you're
picking up probably 350 or so 3.5 percentage points of costs effectively. So, I would say that's probably the
biggest factor and the higher deposit costs.
And while you saw the NIM really contract sequentially, it was largely due to us intentionally growing the higher-
cost deposits. But again, a lot of that is geography because effectively what we have done is raise the higher-cost
deposits of the Bank segment through the Enhanced Savings Program, and then essentially shifted more of the
lower-cost sweep balances to third-party banks. And so, that shows the NIM at the Bank segment contracting
sequentially, but you see the corresponding benefit to the firm with third-party fees, which shows up in the PCG
segment. And that's why, as Steve pointed out, we were able to generate better-than-expected and better-than-
industry trends at least [indiscernible] (00:49:09) sequential basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah, very clear. I appreciate that context. Also for my follow-up, how has feedback and adoption for RCS been?
I was curious on what the mix between outside advisors joining the platform was versus the transition of existing
advisors on the platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the growth has been great. We're over 10% now of our assets in the RCS division. When we
first probably opened it, we had a bigger movement of internal people who wanted to go RIA that just switch
platform, which again as part of the noise and advisor count, when advisors move from our employer independent
division, we count them as advisors. And once they're in the RCS, they're not registered, they're RIA, so they're
one firm, right. So, we drop them out of the advisor count, so.
But the assets would stay, and I think the proof point in that is the growth, the NNA in assets, which I think for the
year and for the quarter have been above most of the players in the market. The speed and the recruiting outside
has picked up too now that we've gotten the platform much more robust, increased the technology significantly.
Hopefully, the long-term growth will come from the outside. But we do have people here. If they want to operate in
the RIA format, they're welcome to switch affiliation options. But that has slowed down over the last couple of
years from the initial opening of it, so more people came over.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe, Paul, I mean, you talked a lot about sorting, I guess, starting to
decelerate, ESP growth decelerating. You have some pricing benefits on third-party sweeps. If we look beyond
the first quarter or next quarter in terms of the guidance on rate-sensitive revenue, do you start to see things
stabilizing? I guess, I'm not asking for specific guidance, but if you could kind of help us think through the puts and
takes, and when we start to see those revenues maybe potentially stabilize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I don't think anyone can really tell you exactly when cash sorting will fully stabilize across the industry. I know a lot
of firms have been trying to convince you of that for the last 12 to 18 months, but we've been trying to be pretty
transparent with you guys. And so, what we have said in the last three months at least is that we feel like we're
closer to the end of the sorting dynamic than the beginning, and you sort of are seeing that in the numbers. But
we're not going to sort of declare an end to that dynamic until we have several months of data to support that.
But to your point, longer term, we are excited about the position that we're in now with the strong capital position,
with the $16 billion almost of cash with third-party banks. That gives us a lot of dry powder to really grow the
balance sheet when the attractive opportunities come. And we think we'll be in a position of strength there
because not a lot of other firms in our space will have the capital and funding to pursue that attractive growth. So,
we're in a great position. Again, it's a reflection of that long-term client focus, the flexible balance sheet that we've
always strived to maintain, even when being criticized for it over the last few years. But we're in a pretty good
position now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Jim, I think for us to really be able to call it in, and is really when interest rates stabilize, if the Fed was starting to
raise rates again and ultimately the securities in I guess money market funds and you have a higher-rate
competitor, so you have to raise rates. I mean, that's really the dynamic. And it appears that the Fed is closer to
the end of the cycle of doing that and rates stabilize, I think the sorting will stabilize also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. That's fair. And maybe just the follow-up on the credit side, some pretty big additions to reserves. You said
you feel comfortable. I guess, what changes that, you mentioned macro. Just trying to think through how you're
feeling about the credit provision story there given that loan growth has been pretty flattish.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We think credits are up. We like the profile. We like the risk. We've always tried to be proactive on adding to
reserves to make sure we're well-reserved and often are a bit ahead of movements. The one thing we don't
control sometimes is our models. Some of our macroeconomic models are based on [indiscernible] (00:54:10).
But we try to stay ahead of the credit and we're – as you could see in 2009 through a very tough credit period, we
did pretty well, we're pretty credit-tough. Maybe it was different this cycle and starting in COVID, we have sold off
16

loans, so we didn't like the credit yield trade-offs and risk trade-offs, and we've continued to do that kind of a one-
off basis. So, that's been an extra tool that we use to manage credit. So, we're feeling pretty good. Now, if the
economy spins out of control, then we've got other issues. But it seems like even if things slow down, which they
may, as long as people are employed and buying, we think we'll get through it pretty well, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. So, the additions are more macro-driven rather than specific concerns internally?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say the additions this quarter were sort of a number of item-specific loans, where we, as Paul said,
tried to get in front of it with additional reserves when possible. There are also modest amount, I think charge-offs
were flat sequentially. So, nothing dramatic. We feel good about the portfolio overall, but we try to get ahead of
things, especially when the market environment is as unpredictable as it is as Paul said.

Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul and Paul. And most have been covered here, but I do want to just touch on the fixed
income businesses briefly. So, your debt underwriting obviously had its best quarter in some time, can be a little
bit of seasonality there, but did have a better result than some peers. So, just curious whether that's some
idiosyncratic deals or if you're actually seeing conditions for that business maybe starting to improve a little bit
from depressed levels.
And then, I guess conversely, the fixed income brokerage business took a little bit of a step lower from already a
pretty tough level. So just, whether you see any catalysts on the horizon that could drive better results there as
well?

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think the fixed income debt, certainly the activity was up. We did have a pretty big deal in the quarter also. So,
that was part of the pick-up. And long-term client were in rotation. We happened to have a big hard turn for kind of
the big underwriting. So, it's a little bit of both, I would say. But certainly the big deal had an impact.
And the lack of interest rate kind of, as Paul talked about, was the depositories without excess cash still waiting
for stabilizing too, so that part of our franchise has certainly been slow. And I think in general, the trading has
been, as you look at spreads, whether in triple-A munis or mortgage securities or stuff, they have very high
spreads right now. People are just waiting for rates to pick up because certainly the spreads there are higher than
they've been in a while, but the activity is not way up.
So, I think people are waiting to feel like they know where interest rates are going to stabilize. And until then, it's
going to be a tough business, maybe a little better. It's hard [indiscernible] (00:57:48) a lot lower, not impossible.
But when it really picks up, I think you're going to have to see more of a stabilized outlook and interest rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Got it. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:58:02) done extremely well since joining us, so. They've been a great addition, and well-ahead
of what we would expect, and the traditional business has been at lows given this interest rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. Okay. Good color there. And then, just a follow-up briefly just on kind of corporate M&A. I hear all the
comments around growth opportunities with capital, and obviously opportunistic buybacks. But just more broadly,
how you would just characterize the flow deals you're seeing across the firm right now? And then, just where the
appetite is at the moment, just given the higher cost of capital, how much of that calculation maybe appetite for
M&A has changed, because you guys clearly have been acquisitive over the last several years here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that first, cost of capital is in packing deals. So, it's two things. First, it's pricing. So, with the buyers, the
cost of capital saying, well, this is significantly higher, and pricing has been slower to come down, which isn't
unusual in another M&A cycle, so that went through. The prices the slowest to adjust. And so, we have empathy
for M&A bankers as we look at things too, we have the same thing when you look at debt was free and you layer
on a seven or eight or nine or whatever the cost of rate is, especially for a lot of M&A firms where it's more higher-
risk debt, I mean it impacts the pricing. It just has to.
So, we see that both in the M&A business, it's back up. So, you can see people doing deals now in the fourth
quarter. We don't expect the next quarter to be a lot different. But the backlog is good. People are waiting, but that
gap, which I think a lot of it's from leveling pricing, and the cost of capital is impacting it, and we see it all the firms.
And I'd say the same thing. When we run numbers, it has an impact, even with our excess capital, we assume we
have to replace it. It makes it tougher. Unless prices adjust a little bit or cost of capital falls, it's going to be harder,
18


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
or people just waited out long enough and go, okay, the lower price is the new price. It's going to take one of
those factors for it to really pick up. So, that's why we gave more of a 6- to 12-month outlook in our M&A
business, just we think that the market is starting to see that, but let's see if that adjusts or not. And I don't think
it's going to happen overnight.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on the bank capital rules. We've seen
some proposals from the banking regulators, including the Basel III Endgame proposal. Just curious how you see
that impacting the opportunity set for your Capital Markets business given you're under the $100 billion asset
threshold. Just curious how you think about the opportunity set for yourselves. But then, as you look out over the
coming years, I'm sure eventually you probably hope you cross $100 billion and grow to that level, just how do
you think about that impacting potentially your Capital Markets business, which area you think might be more
impacted, and how do you think about preparing for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, couple of things. First at our $78 billion and 1% growth, it's going to take a lot of time to get to $100 billion.
And I think people forget that one of the big jumps in our assets is because of the TriState acquisition. We have
no plans to acquire another bank. In fact, it took us five years of looking to acquire TriState, which was the perfect
fit to joining the family. But we're not looking for another banking franchise. Almost anything else we do doesn't
significantly drive our asset size.
So, we think we've got certainly, I'd say five years, you have to cross, and then you get a year to comply, so. And
it could be much longer. So, most of all the rules as you cited are with the $100 billion. And so, I think we have
time to do that. And having said that, we're already internally doing studies on the impact of reporting
requirements, the capital requirements, the technology, everything that's going to be impacted and the regulatory
expectations, which do change when you cross $100 billion. So, we have both inside and outside help. We've
been hiring some people. And this is kind of five years in advance.
19


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2023
So, we're not taking it for granted. We know we'll grow. But as you said, almost the $100 billion became the old
$500 billion before they changed the rule – $250 billion. So, it has brought a lot of those rules down for
significantly higher lift. But I think right now that's in the future for us still a ways.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And just to add one thing to that timeline, one of the reasons that it'll be – we expect it to be around that long is
because one of the things we did during COVID is really accommodated client cash balances on the balance
sheet for the securities portfolio. So, we expect over the next year, for example, for a lot of the banks' loan growth
to be essentially funded with securities that mature out of that portfolio. So, you don't get as much net growth
movement from the loan growth because it's a repositioning of those assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Paul. It's a clarification there because we still expect to grow the bank loan portfolio, so. But it's
being funded on-balance sheet, not off-balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And just a follow-up on that point, as banks that are impacted by the rules either pull back in certain areas
or reprice certain products, how do you think about the opportunity set for you guys to step in, given that the rules
won't apply you for many years? Where do you see the biggest opportunity set for your Capital Markets business
are more broadly from these rules impacting a lot of banks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think that if you look at acquiring Capital Markets businesses or fixed income businesses or Asset Management
businesses really don't significantly impact our asset size. So, what would really impact that is acquiring a bank
because you're acquiring balance sheet, those businesses, especially the M&A, fixed income like even today we
operate – when Morgan Keegan joined us seven or eight years ago, we had $1 billion of inventory, they had $1
billion in their inventory. Today, we have less. We've operated well-under $1 billion in inventory.
So, we think there's a lot of room to acquire a lot of business, if those businesses in that space without really
altering trajectory I talked about to $100 billion. It's the banking size that impacts the balance sheet really. And
that is not our focus, so.
