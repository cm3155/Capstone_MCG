Head of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you so much, Allan. Good morning to all. Thanks for joining us at the end of a very long week. First this
morning our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our results
and our outlook, and will refer to our presentation which you can find at investor.citizensbank.com. And then, of

And now for some quick housekeeping. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are
subject to risks and uncertainties, and you should review the factors that may cause our results to differ materially
from the expectations on page 2 of the presentation and our 2019 Form 10-K. We also utilized non-GAAP
financial measure, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the presentation and to utilize the
information about these measures and the reconciliation with GAAP in the appendix. [Operator Instructions]
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We are in the midst of unprecedented
times with the coronavirus representing an unseen enemy that's wreaking havoc with people's lives and with our
economy. As a large regional bank, we have an important role to play in supporting our customers through these
challenges and in providing essential services to ensure smooth functioning of the economy. I am pleased with
our performance to date. Citizens is rising to the occasion. We are working with borrowers on loan modifications
and on access to government programs to ensure they have the best possible chance to make it through the
crisis.
We have used our strong balance sheet to meet over $7 billion in commercial line draws. We have kept our
branches open to serve individuals and small businesses. We have two-thirds of our staff working remotely and
we have taken precautions to protect those colleagues who must report to work, and have provided them with

additional compensation. And we have made $5 million in grants to small businesses and non-profit partners to
help our communities through these difficult times. In short, we are doing what a responsible corporate citizen
should be doing.
Our financial performance in Q1 was heading towards an excellent quarter prior to the disruption caused by
COVID-19 in March. Nonetheless, we had a very good revenue and PPNR results faced by record mortgage
revenue, strong loan growth, and expanding NIM. If you [indiscernible] (00:03:36) charge-offs as our credit costs
in Q1, we would have had a $0.94 quarter. But, of course, the new CECL accounting standard requires a
recalibration of lifetime losses on the loan portfolio, given the significantly changed macro environment. This led to
a $600 million provision, representing a $463 million or $0.85 reserve build over charge-offs. As such, our
underlying EPS was $0.09 in the quarter. We have $0.06 of notable items to our TOP program and Franklin
integration costs. So reported EPS was $0.03.
Now, this is more frontloaded than many analysts have modeled. We've assumed a deep recession in Q2
followed by a V-shaped recovery in our forecasts, which is true; would take us back to more normal provision
levels over the balance of 2020. If the recovery is more U-shaped, provisions will be higher. Safe to say, there's a
great deal of uncertainty over the economic outlook. We feel good that we have a strong balance sheet position
with CET1 at 9.4%, our LDR at 95%, and a strong LCR with enormous contingent liquidity.
Our tangible book value per share held steady at $32, and we are confident it will sustain a strong level of PPNR
over the balance of [audio gap] (00:05:03) decision to suspend share repurchases for the balance of 2020 should
maintain a strong CET1 ratio through varying economic scenarios, including a U-shaped recovery. We have
provided significant granular information on our credit portfolios in our investor deck. We believe we have
maintained a highly prudent credit risk discipline. And as a reminder, our DFAST credit losses have consistently
been better than the peer average.
We have continued to make progress on all the strategic initiatives that we had teed up for 2020. Our colleagues
have done a fantastic job of dealing with the COVID-19-related crisis, while also making sure we are hitting our
key BAU deliverables. Current environment presents new risks and opportunities. We are looking for ways to
incorporate these into our strategy with an eye towards coming out of a crisis stronger than our peers. We are not
cutting back on investments designed to drive future customer acquisition and revenue growth. All-in-all, a
challenging time. We are handling things well. I hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
With that, let me offer a welcome to Brendan as our new Head of Consumer. And now, I'll turn it over to John.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce; and good morning, everyone. On page 4, let's start with a brief overview of our headlines as we
navigate this unprecedented environment. We entered this crisis from a position of balance sheet strength. For
example, after the stress experienced in March, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.4% even after
increasing our balance for credit losses $2.2 billion and funding approximately $7 billion of line draws. Our ACL
for loans ratio of 1.73% compares well to stress loss scenarios as well as to peers, and our tangible book value
per share at quarter end is nearly $32 per share, which is stable versus fourth quarter.
Our liquidity ratios were stable, with an LDR of approximately 96%, and we remain in compliance with the LCR.
Earnings at the PPNR level proved to be resilient as we've generated record revenues in fee income, while
absorbing significant negative COVID-19 impacts in multiple fee categories. As a result, we have been committed

to investing in our strategic initiatives including the TOP 6 transformation program and our portfolio of strategic
revenue initiatives.
Moving to page 5, I'll cover some of the ways we are supporting our customers. Many of our customers have
been directly impacted by the pandemic and we have been swiftly moving to assist them during this difficult time,
while still taking appropriate steps to mitigate risks. So far, we've delayed payments on loans were about 70,000
retail customers and about 2,400 small businesses. A number of our commercial clients have taken the defensive
position as they prepare to weather the storm.
Through April 15, we funded about $7 billion in commercial line draws. After the initial rush to draw down on loans
in March, we've seen the pace of line draws slow considerably. Finally, we have been literally working day and
night to facilitate the FCA payroll protection program for smaller companies with less than 500 employees. As of
April 15, we have received applications from over 35,000 companies and have approximately $4 billion in loans
registered with the SBA.
Let's move to page 6 and cover CECL. We increased our allowance for credit losses by approximately $900
million to $2.2 billion at March 31 from approximately $1.3 billion at year-end. This was created in two steps. The
first was the previously communicated day one impact of $451 million effective January 1. The second was the
reserve build of $436 million recorded as part of the first quarter provision of $600 million, which also included
$137 million of charge-offs. At quarter end, the ACL to loans ratio was 1.73%. Retail portfolio had an allowance to
loans ratio of 2.31%, based on longer duration or unsecured loans, while commercial portfolios had an allowance
to loans ratio of 1.2%.
We have also summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario, which is a foundational element of
the CECL reserve estimate. At quarter end, we elected to use the March 27 Moody's baseline which integrates
COVID-19 effects as our base scenario. Given the uncertainty of the continued economic outlook, we also
included an alternate Moody's pandemic scenario and an internally generated scenario. Further, we incorporated
the [indiscernible] (00:10:02) factor to fully account for the benefit of our expected customer assistance efforts and
the impact of the various government support programs on our portfolio.
In general, our economic scenario assumes a steep drop in GDP in 2Q followed by a V-shaped recovery in the
second half of the year. If this scenario plays out, provision requirements over the balance of 2020 will factor the
[ph] impact (00:10:26) for loan growth. If the pandemic impacts are deeper or it takes longer for the economy to
recover, then we are looking at a U- or L-shaped recovery; or if government programs are less effective, we could
require meaningful addition to provision.
Now let me move to the highlights of our underlying results covered on slides 7 and 8. Despite the backdrop of
COVID-19 pandemic and CECL-related reserve build, our results highlight our operational discipline and the
benefit of our diversified business model. We have record revenues and fee income, an improved net interest
margin, and strong liquidity and funding metrics. For the quarter, we reported EPS of $0.09 which was down
$0.84 year-over-year and down $0.90 linked quarter driven by the $0.85 impact of COVID-19 reserve build of
$453 million.
[indiscernible] (00:11:23) $678 million was up 3% year-over-year and down only slightly linked quarter despite
COVID-19 headwinds and the impact of seasonality. We saw strong balance sheet growth including 2% average
loan growth with [indiscernible] (00:11:38) of 7% which benefited NII and help offset the impacts of the more
challenging rate environment. And record fees were driven by record results in mortgage banking and wealth. We
also saw strong underlying performance in capital markets and FX and IRP before COVID-19 impacts.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
On page 9, net interest income increased 1% linked quarter, as the benefit of 1% interest-earning asset growth
and improved mix was partially offset by the impact of the more challenging rate environment and day count. Net
interest margin increased 4 basis points liked quarter, as loan yield benefited from widening LIBOR/OIS spreads
as well as mix. Our proactive pricing actions produced an 11 basis points decline in deposit costs which helped
mitigate yield curve headwinds, as one month LIBOR dropped 38 basis points.
Moving to fees on slide 10. Non-interest income was up 16% year-over-year, with relatively stable levels on a
linked quarter basis. Record results in mortgage banking and trust and investment service fees were partially
offset by the impact of COVID-19 that included a total of $36 million of fair value markdowns on loan trading and
customer derivative assets in the linked quarter as well as the impact of a shutdown and other categories.
On a sequential basis, mortgage banking fees achieved another record, by doubling to $159 million which
reflected strong refi lock volumes and improved gain on sale margins. While management posted another solid
performance with trust and investment services fees up 2% sequentially, the strong managed money sales offset
the impact of market declines.
Capital markets fees of $43 million decreased $23 million from record fourth quarter levels driven by $21 million of
marks on loan trading assets Foreign exchange and interest rate product revenue decreased $25 million from
record fourth quarter levels including a $15 million reduction from a net CVA adjustment, given the falling rates
and lower activity caused by reduced variable term lending volume.
Turning to page 11. Non-interest expense increased $30 million or 3% linked quarter, margins reflecting
seasonality and higher revenue-based compensation. Salaries and employee benefits were up 9%, given the
FICA tax and 401(k) match seasonal impacts along with higher compensation tied to strong mortgage originations
in the quarter. Year-over-year, our noninterest expense was up 5%, largely reflecting the impact of growth-
oriented investments, annual merit, and revenue-based compensation which was partially offset by efficiencies
generated from our TOP programs.
Let's now discuss the loan trends on page 12. Average core loans were up 2% linked quarter and up 3% before
the impact of one sales activity tied to our balance sheet optimization initiatives. During the quarter, we sold an
additional $500 million in non-relationship mortgages which, coupled with fourth quarter activity, reduced average
loans [ph] by almost $1 billion (00:14:52).
On a linked quarter basis, core commercial loans were up 3%, driven by the impact of higher line draws and
strength in CRE. Core retail loans were up 1% linked quarter and up 2% before the impact of the loan sales
activity, given growth in education and merchant financing partnerships. On a linked quarter basis, period-end
loan growth was 7%, driven by 15% increase in commercial given higher line of credit utilization and relatively
stable retail loans.
Moving to page 13. We saw nice average deposit growth of 1% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year as we
benefited from investments we made over the past several years to expand and enhance our capabilities. On a
period-end basis, deposits were up 7%, keeping pace with loan growth. We continue to manage down our deposit
costs across all channels, reducing CD rates, retail money market [ph] promo rate, and taking down the savings
rate (00:15:50) in our digital bank and managing commercial deposits aggressively. As a result, our interest-
bearing deposit costs were down 15 basis points.

Next, let's move to page 14 and cover credit. We continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
instituted a variety of measures to identify and monitor various potential risks. Nonperforming loans increased
11% linked-quarter, driven by a $69 million increase in commercial, largely tied to its new [ph] noncore-related
loans (00:16:26) and modestly higher retail. The NPL ratio of 61 basis points increased 2 basis points linked-
quarter and improved 2 basis points year-over-year.
Net charge-offs came in at 46 basis points for the quarter, up modestly linked-quarter, reflecting an increase in
commercial partially offset by a decrease in retail. The allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans ratio ended
the quarter at 283%, compared with 179% in the first quarter of 2019, up from 184% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Turning to page 15, we have been highly disciplined on credit with prudent risk appetite. In consumer, we remain
focused on super prime and prime borrowers. The weighted FICO score across our portfolio is at 760, and
approximately 90% of the retail portfolio has a refreshed FICO of 680 or better.
Overall, our commercial portfolio is highly granular and diversified in terms of geography, industry and asset
class. Roughly 60% of the portfolio is investment grade on a bond equivalent ratings basis and the risk ratings
improved year-over-year. And we remain underweight to peers in commercial real estate. We have been very
disciplined around client selection and [indiscernible] (00:17:45) developers that we've seen perform well and
responsibly in prior cycles.
And on slide 16, it's also important to note that our company-run DFAST gearing adverse scenario results
performed in line or better than the peer average, which we believe indicates that we are relatively well-positioned
to managing the current crisis.
On page 17, we highlight the granular and diversified nature of our commercial portfolio, along with the areas in
commercial that have been most immediately impacted by the COVID-19 shutdown and low energy prices. We
have run a deep dive across the majority of the commercial portfolio to identify cash flow and liquidity
vulnerabilities, with an eye towards helping our customers through these challenging times, while taking additional
steps to more tightly manage risk. Together, these sectors account for approximately 11% of the total CFG loans.
Overall, we think that the percentage of our portfolio concentrations to these areas of perceived risk are largely at
or below [indiscernible] (00:18:47). We highlighted on the slide some of the factors that we consider to be risk
mitigants to these portfolios, and we have individual tear sheets in the appendix on each industry that provides
more detail on the factors we are monitoring.
Moving to slide 18 on retail credit. Our fresh FICO scores on the consumer side of the house are around 760 and
70% of the portfolio is collateralized. So for some of the areas of potential concern, I will just highlight briefly, in
education, we got again very high FICOs and the InSchool book is 95% co-signs. In the education refinance
portfolio, borrowers have been in the workforce for six years on average and 55% of them have advanced
degrees, and about a third of the portfolio has been co-signed.
The consumer unsecured book includes $2.5 billion of short-duration merchant partnership loans, largely driven
by the Apple platform, as well as loans [indiscernible] (00:19:48) ADT and Microsoft and a firm for Peloton. It's
important to note that the vast majority of this portfolio is subject to loss-sharing arrangement. And the remaining
$1.5 billion is our unsecured installment portfolio, which has very high FICO scores of 760 on average. As with
commercial, we've included more details on these consumer portfolios in the appendix.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
On page 19, as previously mentioned, we feel well-positioned to manage through the current environment with
strong capital and liquidity positions. Strong deposit growth kept pace with elevated loan growth, leaving our
liquidity metrics steady. We have a diversified funding profile with very strong [indiscernible] (00:20:31) core
deposit and substantial capacity to do more for our clients as they manage through the crisis.
In March, we announced that we would cease share repurchases and with the extent of the pandemic disruption
becoming clearer, we have decided to extend that through the end of the year to ensure that capital levels are
strong to meet loan demand. We expect to remain well-capitalized and intend to maintain the dividend at the
current level.
On page 20, I want [indiscernible] (00:20:59) a few exciting things that are happening across the company. While
we are first and foremost focusing on helping our clients, we have not stopped working to help build a better
company. We are driving forward on our strategic initiatives so that we emerge well-positioned for the future. We
are continuing to execute on the transformational TOP program, and we are also moving forward with our major
strategic revenue initiatives, while considering new opportunities arising from the current environment in an effort
to drive higher revenue growth coming out of the crisis.
Moving to page 21, given the impact of the pandemic, it's challenging to predict an outlook for the future. And we
no longer affirm our full-year 2020 guidance. Nonetheless, we do, however, want to offer some higher level
commentary on key categories for full year 2020, with a reminder that we currently expect to see more of a V-
shaped recovery start to play out in the back half of the year. We believe we can deliver modest growth in net
interest income, which includes the benefit of the PPP program. We expect that strong loan growth will more than
offset a meaningful decrease in NIM due to rates.
And noninterest income is now expected to be broadly stable as strength in mortgage is offset by COVID-19-
driven weaknesses in other categories. The outlook of these will depend upon the pace and magnitude of
recovery in the second half of 2020. Noninterest expense is expected to be up modestly, given higher
compensation tied to stronger mortgage production and impacts from COVID-19, which includes government
lending programs and customer relief efforts.
Provision expense has the greatest potential for variability in 2020 and will depend on the depth of the recession
and the pace of recovery. We expect to see strong loan growth, driven by higher line draws in commercial, the
impact of government programs like PPP, as well as the increased demand in education and merchant financing.
At the same time, we anticipate a strong increase in commercial and retail deposits, reflecting heightened
liquidity, given Fed actions and a low-rate environment.
Our regulatory capital ratios are expected to strengthen from current levels under the V-recovery scenario as net
income coupled with the suspension of buybacks to year-end more than offset the impact of higher RWAs. Even
in more severe economic scenarios, we expect our capital ratios to remain strong and above required minimums.
Now let's move to page 22 for some high-level commentary on the second quarter. We expect NII to be up low to
mid-single-digits as strong loan growth more than offsets the sizeable decrease in NIM.
Fee income is expected to be down in the low to mid-single-digit range, reflecting COVID-19 impact from service
charges, card and other fees. Noninterest expense is expected to be up slightly given the COVID-19 impact
mentioned earlier. But net-net, we would expect positive operating leverage in the quarter. But this expense will
depend on the depth of recession and pace of recovery.

Finally, we expect significant loan growth, reflecting line draw from commercial, the impact of government
programs and increased demand in education. Our capital, liquidity, and funding positions are expected to remain
strong.
To sum up, on page 23, we are focused on delivering well for our stakeholders in these challenging times. We
have strong balance sheet and leadership team and [indiscernible] (00:24:35) that give us confidence that we'll
rise to the occasion.
Now let me turn it back to Bruce.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you so much for all the detail that you provided. I'm wondering as we think about a potential U or W-shape
recovery, how does the economic parameters are playing out during this pandemic compared to the DFAST
scenario that imply a cumulative loss rate of 4.1% over nine quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So I'll go ahead and start off on that, Erika. I think the way that we look at this just big picture is how – when
you look at our reserve to loan ratio of $2.2 billion that we have and that 1.73%, that really positions us well.
When you go back and look at the 2018 cycle, which is the last time we went through the debt process. And it
also positions us well for the 2020 cycle based upon our internal estimates of how much coverage we're creating.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
So to cover a few numbers on that front, if you go back to the Fed scenarios and look at the adverse scenario,
and there's been a fair amount of analysis that illustrates that the rate environment and other aspects of the
adverse are pretty similar to what we're going through today. And our $2.2 billion would represent 86% of
coverage on those losses in the adverse scenario in terms of our internal estimates. The Fed numbers would be
around 55%. We think we'll do better than the Fed. We've had remapping issues that have gone in our favor and
we've consistently estimated losses that would be lower than the Fed models would indicate
But even as we look at the Fed models, we have 55% coverage of the adverse scenario from back then. You fast
forward to – even if there was a severely adverse scenario, similar to what the Fed scenario would indicate in
2020, our coverage would be around 45%. We believe there's maybe better than – maybe some peers given the
comments made earlier about where we think our loss ratios are going to come out. So we think that positions us
very well. And maybe I'll stop there and see if that's responsive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And my follow-up question is I'm wondering if you can help quantify the magnitude of net interest margin
decline in the second quarter. And of that magnitude, how much would be attributed to the payment protection
program? And if we assume that those loans pay off by third quarter, does that mean that NIM could be at a
higher starting point in third quarter versus 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll take your question. So the way I would look through it is we start off with the rate environment itself. And
given the LIBOR/OIS spread widening out in the first quarter, we really haven't felt all of the impact of the rate cuts
from 1Q. And there's an expectation that that'll narrow in in the second quarter. And so LIBOR and rates in
general, [indiscernible] (00:28:49) expectations will be down, call it, 70 basis points or so across the curve, both in
the short end and in the long end.
In the past, we've indicated that for every 25 basis points, you would see about $15 million of NII impact with
respect to NIM. And so that will help you triangulate and for – that $15 million is typically in the neighborhood of
[ph] 300 basis points. (29:15) So if you triangulate all of that, that will give you a sense for maybe low-teens
impact to the rates.
The other aspects we have to look at in Q2 is mix as you mentioned. How large will the PPP program be, that isn't
dilutive, what is our mix in the rest of the loan portfolio we're seeing, [indiscernible] (00:29:36) demand underlying
the that the PPP and other lines are out, so that still happen in our education portfolios and merchant finance that
we indicated earlier, that actually provides a benefit. But when you look at all of those things, we still think that
there will be a meaningful and significant decline in net interest margin given rates in the second quarter.
The third – your question about third quarter, based on how we're planning to account for PPP, which at the
moment, looks like will all flow through the NII line, and if you think about the forgiveness cycle, if we're going to
amortize the fees that we expect to earn on the PPP program over the contractual life of the loans up through the
forgiveness date, so if you expect maybe 8 to 10 weeks after funding that there could be some forgiveness, and
majority of loans being forgiven given that this is intended to be a grant program, you would see all that come into
NII in the third quarter, all driving net interest margin, then that would reset net interest margin higher in the third
quarter.

And I would just add, Erika, also that you commented on NIM, but lose sight of the fact that we're calling NII to be
up in Q2 because of volume. The volume effect should offset the NIM contraction.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. I really appreciate the guidance that you gave on slide 6 about CECL. I think it helps out
tremendously. The question I have, just – your first bullet there, you talked about you're using Moody's baseline,
but you're also saying you're using your own internal assumptions. Can you just talk a little bit more about your
own internal assumptions? Are they more severe or less severe than Moody's and how much weight did you put
on your own assumptions versus the Moody's assumptions? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. A couple of thoughts on that. So I think our baseline scenario that has – that's overweight is the Moody's
3/27. The internal scenario, I would say, is maybe equal to slightly more punitive than that scenario. We have
another Moody's scenario.
At the time that we were closing our books, I think the 3/27 was based on what's really one of the most punitive
Moody's scenarios that ever out – was out there. So we had another levels of – was slightly less significant than
that coming but still pandemic-driven. So we use [ph] 3 (00:32:13) in general, but the majority is really focused on
this Moody's baseline.
The other scenario [indiscernible] (00:32:22) variety of other lenders associated with it. We have this 18% down
with GDP and the 9% on unemployment. But, as an example, our internal scenario would have gotten
unemployment up to 11%. So just to give you a sense for how we [indiscernible] (00:32:42) there's a significant

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would add, Ken, too that we were trying to be as conservative as we could. I think by taking that very late
forecast into account, we've certainly been watching, where the Moody's scenario model moves. And I'd say, it's
moved a little more conservatively. It's hard to say what exactly – what kind of translates into impact on our
reserving with this point. I think we just have to see more data play out before we could look at that.
So if the recession is either deeper, which currently looks like that could be the case, and then with recovery ends
up extending a little bit, which I'm not sure necessarily is the case, we just have to see. There's certainly a big
groundswell for starting to reopen the economy, given the pain that everybody is suffering. So we'll just have to
watch those two factors and then go back and update things as we get to the end of the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then just one other question. On the same slide, you mentioned that if there is a U-shape
recovery, for example, you could have [indiscernible] (00:34:06) provisions. I understand the concept, but I guess
my question really is, like, it seems that your – the assumptions you've made went from, let's say, good period,
right, to – even before the pandemic – to something really bad including the deep recession. Can you just help us
understand if there is a U-shape recovery and it takes another quarter for things to get better, why does provision
– why would provision be meaningfully higher than next step? May not be higher than first quarter, but why would
it be as fairly large given the vast majority of your assumptions that you've already made sort of the vast majority
of the negative revision, so to speak, if that make sense to your economic models.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe I'll answer this way, Ken. I think one thing that we – as Bruce mentioned, we did look and notice that
since March 27, Moody's has updated, I think, it was on April – it was earlier this week – April 13 earlier this week.
And we're seeing some eye-popping GDP numbers that come out instead of 18%, it's 30%, et cetera. I think the
depth is one thing, but the length of the downturn in terms of whether it's U is another.
At a very big picture, I think one way to think about this, if something like that were to occur, I would basically – I
think we're positioned in a way that our capital ratios which were around 9.4% at the end of the quarter would
remain broadly stable to up slightly, even if we were to directionally assume another scenario that would have,
well, certain aspect – the aspects of Moody's update that would have taken GDP down to 30%. And I think that
that's what this is about, is articulating capital strength, and our allowance alone – coverage would, of course,
increase. It would get to something with a two handle on it as opposed to [ph] 1.73%. (00:36:08) but nevertheless,
our capital ratios would be broadly stable to up – potentially even up slightly under one of those scenarios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I would just add to your specific question as to why, Ken, I'd say, if it takes longer to get back to an
operating economy, clearly, there's more stress on companies that can open and start collecting revenues and
serving customers. And then, clearly, individuals don't get back to work as quickly, so there's more stress on
individuals. So you would just have to do the recalibration on that and see where that puts you. So I think it's
possible.

I think we put a good number on the board here in the first quarter. And we'll have to wait and see how much
adjustment we'd have to make based on further input. But in any case, I think John did underscore the big point,
which is our capital ratio was strong and can absorb that. And so we feel good that we can both meet the loan
demand coming in from our customers, put away what we need to, if we need more reserves, and still maintain a
very strong capital position.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe starting with fee income. I was hoping you could expand a bit on your
second quarter outlook. I know you mentioned service charges in cards, but any insight and thoughts into, say,
mortgage and capital markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start off. I think that we've seen another record quarter in mortgage and record in wealth.
On the capital markets front, frankly, before the loan trading mark that we took, which had an impact of $21 million
in the quarter, we were having an exceptional quarter on top of exceptional quarter in 4Q.
So mortgage outlook, we're still quite strong. We had an excellent quarter in 1Q. I think our early expectations are
that we'll have a similar performance in 2Q. I mean it's early days and things can move quickly. But from what
we've seen in April, although maybe lock volumes may not be quite as strong as they were in the first quarter, our
margins have really, frankly, increased to levels that we've never seen before given all of the operational capacity
issues across the industry. And we've been a source of financial strength and execution certainty, and that has
driven our margins up in mortgage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And allows us to gain market share as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Absolutely. And we're taking share across all our channels, which is really excellent to see. It's positioned us
extremely well. And in the wealth space, we've been able to have, frankly, managed money sales, really nice
uptake there that's been offsetting our market declines. And so we've had good momentum on that front. And
then, in capital markets, it's really market-dependent. So those are [indiscernible] (00:39:33).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A

Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Well said. Thanks, John. On mortgage, the nonbanks are having some challenges as well. So we're
[indiscernible] (00:39:48) supporting your comments around margins widening out. We expect that to broadly
continue. Our pipeline is extremely full. We're growing our LOs mildly through Q1 and into Q2. So we expect
mortgage to continue to be extremely strong through the quarter.
On the service charge line, our debit transactional volume was down at the end of March, 35% to 40%. That's
driving the pullback in Q2, both on debit fees but also less transactions leads to less overdraft occurrences. So we
do expect that to recover towards the back half of Q2, broadly aligned with our guidance and V-shaped recovery
through Q3 and Q4. But that's putting some strain on Q2 for service charges. And so I think John covered the
wealth story really well. So I won't add anything to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
On capital markets, I think in general, deal activity will be below because of the uncertainty in the environment.
But there are a couple of encouraging signs we're beginning to see. There was huge inflows into the high-yield
funds over the last couple of days. We're actually seeing more high-yield issuance as companies try to garner
more liquidity and buffer their liquidity position. So we're benefiting a little bit from that now. And you'll remember
that we also bought another boutique M&A firm this quarter and they happen to be very focused on restaurant
restructuring businesses. So we're beginning to see some opportunistic flow there.
And I'll also mention that we're actually seeing some quite strong activity in our IRP businesses right now as these
companies actually are garnering liquidity by restructuring existing slots and putting some slots on the books to
take advantage of the current positioning. And on the market, John talked about, we've actually seen about [ph]
32% (00:41:33) of that reverse already as we've seen rallies in both the leverage loan market and the high yield
market. So some of that's come back to us already. So we're a little cautious, but we're seeing a few signs of life
out there.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So there's been some ongoing concerns in the market that you take more credit risk, and I think some of the
details that you provide today should alleviate those concerns. But here we are entering a credit cycle, and I think
this is a chance to show that your credit is not worse than others. Obviously, your estimates internally are better
than peers. But as we think out over the next several quarters, couple of years, what are the metrics that we
should be looking at to evaluate your credit performance versus others? And it sounds like an obvious question,
but obviously, there's all these payment deferrals going on. So it may not be as straightforward as kind of look at
the traditional trends, but wondering how you would think about and frame that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes. Let me start and then, John, you could pick up, but it's almost – I remember when we did have that
perception out there that we had grown fast and it won't end well. And so we all had people inside the shop say,
gee, just wait [ph] until we get into (00:43:00) recession and then we can prove it. Really almost wished for a
recession, I said be careful what you wish for because I'd be happy to [indiscernible] (00:43:08) many, many
quarters and years without experiencing recession.
But here we are. So I think we feel really, really good, first off, on the consumer side of the house that each of
those portfolios that we have we've stayed with a very conservative risk appetite, super prime, high prime. We've
moved into spaces where we think we can get good risk-adjusted returns even with that conservative risk profile.
And so you saw us grow, explore, and pioneer the growth of the education refinance market, which we think is
one such place.
And then also on our merchant financing unsecured business where we have loss-sharing arrangements with
very strong credit counterparties that also, I think, gives us a very good risk-adjusted rate of return in those
portfolios. And so, some of the Fed modeling doesn't pick that up and we obviously have the ability to understand
that and pick that up. So I do think we'll end up performing well on the consumer side better than expectations
and I think better than peers. And so, that would be kind of the bedrock that you should be watching that and I
think hopefully you'll see us deliver on that.
And then similarly on commercial, we have – as we've grown the book, we've actually grown faster with bigger
companies, bigger customers in the mid-corporate space, and those customers tend to be more highly rated than
the middle market companies. And so there again, that should benefit us when we go through this period. And I
think we've also been very disciplined in terms of the industries that we're banking, trying to be, say, well
diversified, trying to make sure our whole positions are granular.
And so, I think that should also provide a benefit in the areas of commercial real estate or sponsors. We've also
kept the list of counterparties that we want to deal with quite tight, folks that we know and have done business
with for a long time. We think they're good operators, we think they treat their banks well, so I think that should
also work in our favor.
And then I guess you'd look at the same things, you'd be looking at the charge-off rate in those portfolios over
time. So, anyway, I think we will – now's the proving time, so we feel good about how we've maintained our
discipline and how we've done BSO and repositioned ourselves to make higher net interest margin and better
returns while keeping an incredible discipline on the risk part of the equation.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And maybe just to add to that, Bruce, I mean I think you asked about metrics. I mean I guess I'd break it
down. The charge-offs have always been lagging. They may be even more lagging in this cycle than in the past
given all the forbearance activities that we're going to be engaging in, but nevertheless, we will be monitoring
them.
As you think about the current positioning where I think we keep an eye on reserves to total loans, which we
indicated was 1.73% today, I would also maybe just highlight the diversification across the balance sheet and
keep an eye on that. We are right around 50/50 in terms of commercial/retail. And when you dig into each one of
those books, whether it's in the commercial side areas of interest or concern, they're all in the low – very low
percentages of the overall book and geographically diversified as well.
And then on the retail consumer side of things, yeah, in mostly collateral lines in areas that we understand and
have been in businesses for a very long time, and where we are not collateralized, it's distributed across several
different asset classes, not all the [ph] kind (00:47:16), we were in student, we were in card, we were in merchant
finance and there's a personal and [ph] skilled (00:47:20) product. So we think that is the name of the game there.
So those are the current metrics. Forward-looking metrics really comes down to stress results which we [ph]
geared (00:47:28) better than media in the past. And our internal modeling which we have thought have been
increasing levels of sophistication over time and we've been back testing and trying to keep current. So I think
those are the three areas you'd want to monitor when you're thinking about things through the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And can you just – that's all helpful color. Can you just remind us this slide 16 where you talk about your internal
stress test showing loss rates going down 50 bps versus last year? Can you remind us what drove that? Was that
some de-risking or model changes or just remind us what drove that big drop? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean I think there was a couple of things. I mean I think that over time, we've been doing a better job of
[indiscernible] (00:48:18) our risk ratings to – we basically had frankly underappreciated the strength of the risk
ratings across the portfolio and say that was the driver of the improvement. Secondly, the full effect of loss-
sharing arrangements in our merchant finance portfolio that have been fully built in. And then third, just over time,
the non-core portfolio has been dropping which had some higher loss content. It's gotten down to a very small
level. So those are the things that come to mind for me in terms of what the drivers were.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Sorry about that. Going back to the stress test, I wonder if you could just speak a little more to the impact of
Fed support and broader government stimulus. And I'm sure it's hard to put a number on it, but I guess the thing
that's striking to me is if I look at unemployment and GDP, clearly we're probably going to be worse at least for a
little while. But on the other side, the stock market is at 13,000, BBB credit yields are at 6.5% whereas they're like
3.5%, 4% today. So when we think about the balance between the macro versus asset prices, clearly the macro
is probably the biggest input, but how much of a buffer or shock absorber do those better asset prices give in your
mind?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, I think that the thrust of the question is the Fed is obviously stepped up here, as I understand it and that's
made a big difference in the markets certainly, the pricing of assets has come in which is a signal that credit
quality is better or potentially companies will experience less stress at least from [ph] problems (00:50:58) as long
as the Fed is playing the way they're playing. And so how much weight do we place on that when we kind of do
our modeling and look at the reserving that we're doing. Is that the question, really? Is that the thrust of the
question?

Bruce Winfield van Saun A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say, there's a couple of things. It has a meaningful impact. I mean I think that's one of the big items that
distinguish this current stress environment from possibly the modeled environments you would see coming out of
the Fed, right? So when you go back to the [ph] 2018 (00:51:39) cycle and you see the results there, they don't
have this massive stimulus that we have given reasonable weight to in our outlooks. And so, that is embedded.
And it's not just the government actions which are significant on the fiscal front and the monetary front. It's also
our internal actions that are idiosyncratic and all the little things that we're doing to get ahead of this that are very
hard to model in...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Like forbearance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly. I have a forbearance that we're doing, all the modifications that we're doing, how aggressive we'll be in
there, and our insights and instincts around where to target those efforts. We've built that in in our modeling...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...along with the overall support from the government. That's a meaningful impact.
And the other thing to keep in mind, and I should add this, the other important distinction when we look back at
severely adverse scenarios is that all of those scenarios are all U-shaped. You heard from Bruce earlier. U-
shapes are very stressful. V-shapes are less so. And so even if GDP in prior severely adverse scenarios don't fall
by as much as we're all saying there that it could fall today, the fact that it stays well for such a long period of time
is what creates all that stress in the prior severely adverse scenarios. So when you fast forward to where we are
today, what we're assuming, what we have in our numbers is more of a stronger recovery in 2H that's more V-
shaped and we also have the support – the significant support of the stimulus and our internal actions.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Yeah. I do think, though, it's safe to say we've never seen – I mean, the Fed has pulled out all their tools from
their toolkit from the last go-round and then they've added more, and the fiscal stimulus bill was ginormous and
very expensive and fat in terms of trying to get the cash out to help companies and to help individuals. And so we
really don't have much to go by in terms of modeling all of that – the kind of easing off of TDR treatment on
forbearance to encourage that that's another delta that hasn't been in prior models. So there's just a lot of
uncertainty overall with this modeling. And I think all banks are doing the best they can both with the scenario and
then kind of some of the offsets from federal government actions, from the Fed kind of reserve actions and then
from the internal actions, which is why I think we'll just need more time to clarify kind what is that true picture as
we go through the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
If I could sneak in one more, if I just think about your ability to maintain dollars of CET1 capital over the next year,
like, total loss absorption capacity, I guess you've got $650 million a quarter, maybe $700 million of PPNR. I mean
it seems like you would have some securities gains you can harvest if you needed to, which would pull it into
CET1 capital and then you've got some relief on the CECL accounting. I mean it kind of seems like when you add
it all up, the loss absorption, so to speak, over the next four quarters maybe is like $3.5 billion or something. Is
that kind of a fair way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So I'll go and start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would probably just say it's ample that we are very focused on continuing to deliver strong levels of PPNR. I
think that's one of the first lines of defense. And we see, I think notwithstanding all of the change in the
environment, our PPNR level was still up versus a year ago on the first quarter and it was close to flat on a
sequential quarter basis. And we think there's a good ability to sustain that over the balance of the year. So you
basically start with that. We have obviously some BSO actions that we could take if we needed to to kind of
release some RWAs and also create some additional capacity. And then I think on the capital line, we think our
dividend is secure, but we've curtailed buybacks for the rest of the year. So if you put that all together, I'd say
we're very confident in our outlook that if the situation worsens, we have very strong capital position and levers to
pull and ability to continue to [ph] post good number of (00:56:31) shares.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And just to add to that. I mean I think Bruce mentioned stability in PPNR that's one of the first lines of
defense and our diversified – increasingly diversified business model across NII and across fees is really helping
on that front. Our transformation programs are helping on that front. I would also mention that I think you
mentioned securities. Just based upon where rates are, we exclude given – we've excluded AOCI from our capital
ratios. But if you were to take a look at that, that's in – it's almost $1 billion of marks that are unrealized. And so
that's part of the balance sheet strength that you would want to look at in the event that you're trying to figure out
that part of the story as well.

I mean, all in, RWA is expected to rise during the year. And if our scenarios hold, we expect that our CET1 ratios
are going to be stable to rising throughout the year. So you put all that together and I think that's hopefully
responsive to triangulate where you're trying to get to in terms of where dollars of capital strength will be.

First, the transparency of your slide deck is one of the best, so thank you for doing that. It's very helpful for all of
us. And on slide 5, you've given us some good detail on the forbearance. And then I know this is quite a bit
difficult question to answer, but two parts. What percentage of your portfolio do you think will actually ask for
forbearance both in the commercial and the retail?
And then second, how are you guys going to monitor loans that go into forbearance and actually are going to be
charge-offs or they're going to be non-accruals? But initially, they're going into forbearance because everybody is
permitted to do that. Can you share with us some of the guardrails that you might have to develop to make sure
that you're not – again, not doing it on purpose but there is an extend and pretend limitation here?

Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So Gerard, it's Don. On the commercial side, we've actually done an extremely detailed liquidity, cash burn
analysis across the portfolio and bucketed our clients into three buckets. One, a bucket that we – some kind of
restructuring and [ph] call it – we don't really call it (00:59:24), forbearance in the commercial bank with some kind
of payment relief or restructuring of the payments. And that's a very small portion of the portfolio like less than 5%.
Then there's another maybe call it 20%, 25%, where we think two or three quarters out they're going to need
covenant restructuring and maybe some relief from covenants depending how the recovery materializes, and then
the vast majority of the portfolio we think looks just fine from a cash-on-cash standpoint. So, we're really looking at
everything cash-on-cash at this point and it'll be developing, but we're very comfortable that it's a relatively limited
number of people in our portfolio that are going to need really payment relief.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
[ph] Hi, Gerard. (01:00:08) Yeah. On the consumer side, we've got above 4% of our portfolios in forbearance
status at the moment. The majority of those are three-month forbearance programs. What's interesting is, we're
seeing a meaningful amount of our forbearance to customers that are actually cash flowing and still making their
payments. And so, we believe a large percentage of our customer base is doing this as a safety net and not yet
under duress yet. So we're working hard on analytics to subsegment our forbearance portfolio to identify further
treatments as they come off the 90 days.
If there are some that have significant stress and can't make their payment, we've got another lever for another 90
days prior to having them all through charge-off. And for those that waited through the quarter successfully they'll
come back into full principal and interest payments. So, we've got a variety of collection tactics and support tactics
for our customers to help them make the right choices, a variety of other levers in our collection shop should
alternative programs make more sense than a forbearance as well. So yeah, we'll see how the next few months
goes.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to ask a little bit about on the line draws. You guys mentioned in one of
the earlier slides, obviously how they had slowed through April and that the usage has been in the industry's most
affected. I wanted to ask you about, you mentioned that about 60% of the draws are converted to deposits. And
what do we take away from that? Meaning, is it that the other 40% might be being used or is it that those just
aren't current customers? And how do you expect – any sense that if the line draws are less at this point that
you're going to start to see somebody's just get paid down if, in fact, we do get the V-shape, and how quickly?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would actually say, we are seeing some pay downs already. I think early days, say, the first two weeks of
the pandemic we saw a lot of preemptive draws inside, particularly in the kind of BBB segment which is where
they were concentrated. So, the bigger companies felt very liquid with strong balance sheet. The weaker
companies, frankly, don't have a lot of capacity to draw, so they're really concentrated in the crossover sector.
Some of those are starting to come back.
And what we've seen over the last actually two weeks is, more deposit inflow kind of in scale than we've seen line
draws. So, I think there is a lot of just very defensive behavior early on as companies got their heads around, one,

whether their banks were going to be there and I think a lot of [ph] them's testing (01:02:58) banks and those are
beginning to come back. And then, just where was this thing going and let's garner as much liquidity.
So, the market seems to have calmed down significantly. People will draw and pay back, but we see it kind of
regular way right now. And what we do expect is some of those deposits to be – beginning to be used as
companies go through periods of disruption. So we would expect a regular downdraft of the deposits that are
sitting with us, and that's really why we did this cash burn analysis that I talked about on Gerard's question. We
can really see it client by client, and track it...

contemplating in terms of continuing to add to the franchise, and what types of things do you think might appear
for you strategically in that regard?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So we had done, last year when we rolled out TOP 6, a fair amount of work on our strategic thinking, where
are some opportunities where we have strength that we have a right to win, that we can leverage those strengths
to find new revenue streams, the way we did with education refinance or we did with our merchant partnerships.
And so, growing Citizens Access to digital bank, taking it to the next level was one better serving small
businesses; SMEs is another; and then going taking our merchant business in some new directions.
I think all those things still make a lot of sense and we're continuing to keep up our investments there. But we're
also looking at how has the world changed and are there additional offerings? Certainly, the world is becoming
more digital as people have to stay home and we see tremendous upsurge and folks using the online and mobile
platform. And so, what does that mean for the future? Does it mean that – for example, the wealth offering for
mass affluent that they might be more willing to be able to virtual advisors, that business now going to take off. So
we're just looking at a whole bunch of brainstorming sessions to think through the world's going to be different,
how do we play, how do me make some additional investments and re-tweak our overall way of doing business
and the strategy.

Just to confirm, so when it comes to your loan loss reserve level now post the build that you put through this
quarter, so based on what you know now and your assumption for the direction of how this plays out, there's
nothing you see that happened in April after you closed the books that will point to the need for an additional loan
loss reserve build in second quarter for COVID?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'll start off there. I mean, John, as I mentioned earlier, I mean clearly Moody's scenarios have worsened. I think
we have to digest what we're hearing and seeing in those updates. As I mentioned, we have – as one of our base
scenarios we have GDP falling 18%, we have a V-shaped recovery in 2H. The update from Moody's indicates
GDP falling 30%, but nevertheless, still recovery later on. We have an internal...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
As it relates to John's specific question about closing your books, I mean that scenario came out this week and
the books were closed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So I think we had the best information at the time we did our close, and I think we leaned on being at the
conservative end in the assumptions that we took. But as we go through the month of April, it may be that people
think this will be a bit deeper and it may last a little longer and we'll have to come back and reassess that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thanks. Yeah. I just wanted to put that in context to what you were assuming in terms of the
shape of the recovery and what was dialed in. Okay. And then separately, in terms of – on slide 16, your stressed
analysis that you ran resulting in the 4.1%, what was the stressed CET1 output from when you ran that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes. The stressed CET1 would be in the neighborhood in a severely adverse scenario. And I guess I'd say this,
well, in terms of what we've submitted for 2020. In a severely adverse scenario, using our estimates of losses
which we believe are quite prudent and predictive, we would be in the neighborhood of 8% of CET1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI

Probably a little better. I mean you look at – I mean, that's probably maybe a temporary low point, but you'd be
something in the 8% and 8.5% range if you go quarter-by-quarter. [ph] We did the nine-quarter (01:08:39) outlook

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to follow up on – I think it was Ken's question, just it's a bigger –
just more bigger picture question. Obviously, we're all kind of focused on what's directly in front of us right now.
But during times like these, you often will see more meaningful structural change, more meaningful inflections in
the competitive backdrop, consumer behavior. I'm wondering if you have any perspective on that. Have you had
time to take a step back and kind of think about where the puck could be going and how this situation will
influence that?
And in addition to that, how you think about your own strategy in that environment? For example, does it make
Citizens – the importance of investing and being successful with the Citizens Access strategy that much more
important to the client acquisition tool. So, just more of a broader question on the industry and how you think
about – are you sort of recalibrate or you might recalibrate your strategic initiatives on the back of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'll ask Brendan to kick off on that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean on the consumer side, the most obvious trend is an acceleration of one that was already happening,
which is the drive to digitization. And so, I look at all the things that we have in flight, some of which we've got
jump on our peers like you pointed out Citizens Access on a national banking, digital franchise like merchant and

finance. Like the future of our brick-and-mortar distribution network, how do we reposition that for consumers that
have gotten used to coming in less frequently, but still being able to manage their money effectively and get
advice, Bruce pointed out, virtual wealth advisors.
We've got a lot of these things in motion. We've got a significant investment in our mobile and online banking
platform that should start to go live in beta form in Q2. I view this as an acceleration of a lot of those things. So
we're spending some time to figure out how do we get out on our front foot even more, how do we capitalize on
consumer trends that are changing very rapidly. Situationally, we think they could be very sustaining. And I think
the level of confidence I have is high, because we're in a position of strength to have all of these things already in
motion with teams making progress and taking share in the market. So, we're trying to figure out which ones of
those, if they can choose, to really put some significant acceleration, and that's how I sort of see it on the
consumer side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks, Brendon. Just one quick follow-up on CECL then. If we do see a longer recovery and not a V-
shaped recovery, and you did give some helpful reference points on your allowance by product type, and it seems
this quarter the reserve build was really spread out across consumer and commercial. But what segments would
you think are most vulnerable to reserve true-ups? And because I do think your loan book is a little different from
a lot of other peers, you do have a lot of loan types with longer weighted average [indiscernible] (01:12:21) which
for any given loss content will have a higher reserve. So, I'm just curious like how we should think about sort of
the evolution of those reserve rates if you were to have to build greater reserves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So on 26 of the materials, I mean we gave some a breakout of what we – what drove the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...up 23 basis points that we put up. I mean, I think what drove CECL in the first place being very punitive
standard in terms of – versus incurred losses as you mentioned. So, those categories have a lot of – perhaps
some longer maturities associated with them. So, you look at InSchool as a place that would be a driver. Other
areas where there's higher loss content, but there's also higher returns such as car and unsecured.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
That's an area we keep an eye on. And so, that's the two that jump after me on page 26. On the commercial front,
some of the areas inside commercial maybe show up with a little bit less loss content. But those are the top two
that I see on page 26.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Why is InSchool so much higher than refi? Or maybe it's an obvious answer that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, you think about that – what we mentioned a little bit earlier is that – and maybe Brendan can
comment on this, but these are really high FICO, basically great credit risk, great relationship opportunity, people
they've been in the workforce from on average six years. I think the average comp is a six-figure comp type of
borrower. It's pretty high quality versus being InSchool.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
One, you got – usually you have a pair of guarantee on that. But the thing that really kills in the CECL calculation
is maturity. And there's 10,12, 15-year loans in many cases. So, that's why that number is high. We don't
necessarily think we'll have any immediacy to charge off on those portfolios, but that's where CECL doesn't
always give you the answer you would expect.
And in fact, delinquency on those portfolios hasn't moved much at all yet. And so, we're early innings on watching
those portfolios, but we're liking what we're seeing so far. It's really duration. Remember, InSchool also has a
four-year performance period before they graduate. That extends the duration there, too. That's really what's
driving the CECL difference there.
