Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
Stacy C. Kymes
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Marty. And good morning, everyone. Beginning on slide 4, we reported net income of $82.6 million or
$1.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, which includes a $0.52 per share impact from the FDIC special
assessment. I'm exceptionally proud of the BOKF team and our results this year. Our focus at BOKF has always
been on providing long-term shareholder value, driven by our diverse business model and talented team, both of
which empowers to perform well relative to our industry during any economic environment. This was once again
proven when the industry faced stress in the first half of the year and our company was well prepared.
Our disciplined risk management, which extends beyond the credit risk management that has long been a
strength, resulted in strong levels of capital and liquidity in an important time. We took advantage of this position
to thoughtfully grow when others are pulling back. We've made real investments in growing our core C&I, while
also investing in people and new markets like Central Texas. While the fourth quarter was exceptionally noisy with
numerous non-recurring items, our core results were very strong, resulting in a great starting point for 2024.
We continue to make strategic [ph] decisions, deploy (00:02:31) our capital where growth and returns are highest.
This was reflected in our decision to exit our insurance brokerage and consulting business in the fourth quarter.
This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $28 million after transaction expense, which we used to opportunistically
restructure a small portion of our available for sale securities portfolio, which will be accretive to net interest
revenue and the margin in the months ahead.
Staying on this slide, our efficiency ratio was 72% for the quarter. That falls to 67%, excluding the impact of the
FDIC special assessment and the activity related to the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business,
which Marty will highlight later.
Let me briefly diverge and comment on the FDIC special assessment, which I understand most will see as non-
recurring and normalized for the period. The FDIC's methodology was flawed and did not use the root cause of
the issue, which was low levels of fully loaded tangible capital, caused by poor asset liability risk management
decisions. The final rule was disappointing, as they ignored many thoughtful comment letters, including our own.
They announced the public hearing, subsequently canceled the public hearing before voted three, two along
partisan lines to adopt the final rule. This continue the disconcerting trend of increasing partisanship in banking
regulation.
The US is the only country that has allowed partisanship to invade the banking regulatory process. Banking is a
noble profession. We're well aligned with our customers. Collaboration with our industry is necessary and a
missing element today.
Moving on, we believe the strategic decisions and investment we've made this year have us well-positioned for
success in the long-term and our diverse operating model will continue to operate successfully in any market
environment going forward.
Turning to slide 5. Period end loan balances increased $181 million or approximately 1% linked quarter with
growth in both C&I and commercial real estate. Loan growth did slow in the fourth quarter, but our teams remain
confident in our pipelines as we move forward. Both period end and average deposits continue to grow this
quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was stable at 70.3%, remaining well below our peers and providing significant
on-balance sheet liquidity to meet future loan or other liquidity demands.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
While our cost to deposits continue to increase this quarter, the pace was less than half the level we've
experienced the previous three quarters, allowing our net interest margin to stabilize. Marty will comment more
about net interest revenues, but we believe we are very close to the trough. Our credit remains very strong and
we have a combined reserve of $326 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans at quarter-end, which is considerably
above the median of our peer group.
Finally, we repurchased 700,237 shares this quarter to reflect our long-term confidence in the company and to
take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations. I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting
the Q&A session. But now Marc Maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn
the call over to him.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7. Period end loans were $23.9 billion, growing $181 million or almost 1% linked
quarter. Total C&I loans increased $84 million or 0.6% linked quarter with year-over-year growth of $591 million or
4.2%. Commercial real estate loans grew $96 million or 1.8% linked quarter and have increased $731 million or
15.9% year-over-year.
Compared to December 31, 2020, CRE balances have grown at a modest 4.1% annualized growth rate. Growth
this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily properties, with an increase of $138 million and industrial facility
loans with an increase of $43 million. This growth was partially offset by a decrease of $72 million in office loans,
bringing the total office loan portfolio to its lowest point since 2018.
The year-over-year, CRE growth of $731 million was also driven by multifamily and industrial loans and again
partially offset by a decline in office loans. We have an internal limit of 185% of Tier 1 capital in reserve to total
CRE commitments, and we're presently at 172%. That limit is based on total commitments, so we do have ample
room for continued modest growth in outstanding CRE balances as construction loans fund up. As of December
31, CRE balances represented 22% of total loans, consistent with the prior quarter, a ratio well below our peers.
Combined services and general business loans. Our core C&I loans increased $77 million or 1.1% with year-over-
year growth of $281 million or 4%. These combined categories are 30% of our total loan portfolio.
Healthcare balances increased $60 million or 1.5% linked quarter and have grown $298 million or 7.8% year-
over-year, primarily driven by our senior housing sector. Healthcare loans represented 17% of total. Energy loan
balances decreased $53.5 million linked quarter and have increased $12 million or 0.4% year-over-year with
period end balances at 14% of total period end loans. Year-over-year, loans have grown $1.3 billion or 6%.
Excluding PPP loans, Q4 2023 extends the linked quarter loan growth to nine consecutive quarters. Our current
pipeline is strong and combined C&I and CRE commitments increased 2% linked quarter. We expect continued
strong momentum to drive additional loan growth in 2024.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that our credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio,
with credit metrics well below historical norms and pre-pandemic levels. Nonperforming assets excluding those
guaranteed by US government agencies increased $26 million this quarter. The resulting nonperforming assets to
period end loans and repossessed assets did increase 10 basis points to 0.62%. Non-occurring loans increased
$26 million linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in healthcare loans. The increase is consistent with non-
accrual fluctuations in a narrow range experienced over the past two years with no indication of systemic issues.
Committed criticized assets were 10.2% of Tier 1 capital and reserves at year-end 2023, the second consecutive
year below 10.5% and the third below 13% compared to an 18% ratio pre-pandemic. The provision for credit

losses of $6 million in the fourth quarter reflects a stable economic forecast and continued loan growth, as well as
continued low net charge offs. Net charge offs were $4.1 million or 7 basis points annualized for the fourth quarter
and have averaged 8 basis points over the last 12 months, continuing the trend of performance far below our
historical loss range of 30 to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge offs to remain below
historical norms. The markets continue to be focused on the office segment of real estate, given the trends in
workforce preferences.
Our exposure to loans secured by office CRE continues to decline as we intentionally manage that segment
down, now representing less than 4% of our total loan portfolio. Our office maturities are generally ratable over
the next three to four years and we have many firm options if the markets are not conducive to long-term
financing.
The combined allowance for credit losses was $326 million or 1.36% of outstanding loans at quarter-end. The
reserve is sufficient to cover our nonperforming assets by 2.2 times. The total combined allowance is available for
all losses and any apples-to-apples industry comparison should include the combined reserves. We expect to
maintain an appropriate reserve supporting loan growth and reflect [audio gap] (00:10:44) conditions.
Overall, we remain in a solid credit position today with a stable economic outlook. While our current credit metrics
may be unsustainable in weaker economic environments, we have a history of outperformance during past credit
cycles and are well-positioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead.
I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 10. Total fees and commissions were $196.8 million, relatively consistent with the
previous quarter. However, the previous quarter included record-high results for our Wealth Management
segment, with fourth quarter's wealth results still representing their third highest fee income quarter ever. Trading
fees increased $1.1 million, as sales activities related to our institutional customers continue to improve, with
some lift provided by our recent Memphis expansion, partially offset by a linked quarter decline in our MBS trading
activities.
Our bank-wide investment banking activities fell $2.4 million linked quarter, as the third quarter benefited from a
record quarter for wealth Public and Corporate Finance group. Although down from their third quarter record high,
the Public and Corporate Finance group recorded their largest single transaction in their history during the fourth
quarter.
Wealth Management had a record year in 2023, achieving total revenue of $656 million, which eclipsed the prior
record set in 2020 by $140 million, resulting in an annualized three-year growth rate of 8.4%. This was driven by
record 2023 revenue in the majority of our business units, including corporate trust, retirement plan and asset
services, private wealth, customer hedging and investment banking.
Transaction card revenue increased $2.5 million and all other fee-generating categories remained relatively
unchanged compared to the previous quarter, demonstrating the consistent positive results we see from these
business lines. Our assets under management or administration were $104.8 billion at the end of the year,
including an asset mix of 43% fixed income, 33% equities, 16% cash and 8% alternatives. Our diverse mix of fee
income continues to be a strategic differentiator for us and allows us to perform well in a variety of the economic

environments. We consistently ranked in the top decile for fee income as a percentage of total net interest
revenue and noninterest fee income. Our revenue mix has averaged 38% during the last 12 months.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marty.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. I'd like to start by describing a few of this quarter's unusual items as some of them impact
multiple line items. The sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting business resulted in a one-time pre-tax
gain of $31 million, which is included in the other gain net line item and income statement. There were also two
components of transaction related expenses recorded in NIE. $2.5 million reflected in professional fees and
services and $925,000 included in personnel expense, which produced a net gain of $28 million. We took
advantage of that opportunity to reposition our available for sale portfolio resulting in pre-tax losses of $28 million,
which is reported in the loss on available for sale securities line item.
The total $40.5 million reported in the other gains net line item includes the $31 million insurance sale gain, as
well as $5.9 million of gain related to market value increases on deferred compensation assets, which is
effectively offset with $5.4 million of increased personnel expense this quarter. The fourth quarter also included
$3.1 million of accelerated recognition of tax expense as a result of exiting three low income housing tax credit
investments. Without that item, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 23.1%.
Turning to slide 12. Fourth quarter net interest revenue was $296.7 million, a $4.2 million decrease linked quarter.
Net interest margin was 2.64%, a 5 basis point decrease compared to Q3. This quarter reflected a significant
easing of deposit pricing pressure compared to recent quarters. Interest bearing deposit costs increased 26 basis
points in the current quarter. However, this is the slowest pace we have realized since the Federal Reserve
started raising Fed funds rate in early 2023. Our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta increased to 63% for the
fourth quarter. DDA as a percent of total deposits came down to 27% as of December 31. This slide shows net
interest margin and net interest revenue with and without the impact of the trading business to better highlight
trends and comparability. For the fourth quarter, net interest margin excluding the impact of trading assets was
3.03% versus 3.14% in the third quarter. I expect to see a small decline in net interest margin going into Q1,
followed by relative stability after that. Growth in earning assets during the quarter was driven primarily by C&I
and CRE loans.
Turning to slide 13. Liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers. Total
deposits grew $367 million on a period end basis and the loan-to-deposit ratio decreased just slightly to 70.3%.
This is stronger than our pre-pandemic level, well below the median of our peer banks and positions us well for
future loan growth. Average total deposits increased $388 million linked quarter, with average interest bearing
deposits up $1.2 billion, partially offset by a $779 million decline in demand deposits. Brokerage CDs remained an
insignificant amount of our funding and decreased slightly in the fourth quarter.
Our tangible common equity ratio was 8.29%, up 55 basis points, due in large part to term interest rates falling
late in the fourth quarter. Adjusted TCE, including the impact of unrealized losses on held to maturity securities is
8.02%. CET1 is 12.1% and if adjusted for AOCI would be 10.5%. We have sufficient capital to support continued
organic growth and opportunistic share buyback with a high degree of certainty, knowing that the recent
regulatory capital proposal is primarily focused on banks over $100 billion.
Turning to slide 14. Linked quarter expenses increased $59.8 million, up 18.4%, driven primarily by the $43.8
million FDIC special assessment. Personnel expense grew $12.2 million due to four primary factors. Regular

compensation increased $3.2 million due to salaries related to business expansion and expenses related to the
sale of the insurance business. Sales related activities led to a $4.0 million increase in cash based incentive
compensation. Deferred compensation expense, which is driven by market valuations, increased $5.4 million
linked quarter. And lastly, employee benefits increased $1.1 million linked quarter due to seasonal increases in
health insurance costs. Non-personnel operating expenses grew $3.3 million, excluding the increase in FDIC
insurance expense with $2.5 million related to expenses on the sale of our insurance brokerage and consulting
business. We also made a $1.5 million contribution to BOKF Foundation in our continuing efforts to support the
communities we serve.
Turning to slide 15, I'll cover our expectations for 2024. We expect mid to upper single-digit annualized loan
growth. Economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain favorable and continue to be supported by
business in-migration from other markets. The competitive environment for loans should be a tailwind for us. We
expect to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat and to maintain a neutral interest rate risk
position. We expect total deposits to grow modestly and loan-to-deposit ratio to remain near 70%.
Currently, we are assuming no additional rate changes by the Federal Reserve in 2024. We believe the margin
will migrate slightly lower in Q1 of 2024 and expect net interest income to be near $1.2 billion for full year 2024. In
aggregate, we expect total fees and commissions revenue in a range of $825 million to $850 million for 2024.
Excluding the FDIC special assessment, we expect expenses to increase at a mid single-digit growth rate as we
continue to invest in strategic growth and technology initiatives with revenue growth following at a slight lag. As
revenue growth is realized in 2024, we expect the efficiency ratio to migrate downward to approximately 65%.
Our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit
reserve. Given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality, we expect near-term
provision expense to remain low and trend toward more normal credit costs in the second half of 2024. Changes
in the economic outlook will impact our provision expense. Additionally, we expect to continue opportunistic share
repurchase activity.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.

Stacy C. Kymes
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. This quarter was a period on the end of the year with the second highest earnings BOK Financial
has ever achieved. As many banks struggled in the turbulent economic environment, we proved once again that
our strategically diverse revenue mix is built to withstand any storm. While other banks may be pulling back, we
have positioned ourselves to be in a great liquidity and capital position to organically grow our business and
perform very well in 2024. We have strong pipelines going into 2024. We've expanded our market reach. Our
credit quality remains very strong and our fee income businesses are positioned for solid growth. I'm very proud of
the entire BOK Financial team that worked so hard to deliver these strong results.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, question for you, Marty. This is the question I've had a few times this morning on your numbers. Just some
banks are assuming zero rate cuts, others are assuming two to four, others are saying six. What does your net
interest income and margin outlook look like with a few cuts and then maybe as much as six cuts? And I want to
follow-up and ask on fees as well, but maybe just net interest income first.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question, Jon. And yeah, our exposure to rate declining is actually very small. It's actually de
minimis. But more importantly, if you get the forward curve with four or six or cuts in that range, that winds up with
a steeper curve and that's actually better for us. So, in those scenarios where you've got the Fed cutting this year
might actually be marginally better for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, but and you're referring to the billion to guide, so you're saying...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...if we get more cuts that could go higher? Okay, good to hear. And then I guess a question for Scott as well. If
I'm assuming some of the fee guidance that you're giving us assumes flat rates. What does lower – what would
lower short-term rates do to some of your trading businesses and other fee income businesses?

Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Right. So, the two big beneficiaries of that decline would be in our mortgage entity itself with our mortgage
originations in the mortgage group. And then a pretty immediate increase in our mortgage trading, our MBS
activity, both as they have historically with lower rates have outperformed significantly in those lower rate
environments. So, we get significant benefit from both of – that market backdrop if rates were to rise, I mean, to
decrease. I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. But you guys would actually welcome some cutting on the short-end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
There's no doubt about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I mean, mortgages that performing very well for the environment, but that's really at an all-time kind of low in
terms of where we're at from a production perspective. And so, any kind of movement downward in rates is really
going to help that and then that correspondingly is also going to help create more inventory if you will for the
mortgage trading aspect of our business as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
So that level of production and activity revenue generation on the institutional trading group has maintained that
flattish level with the pickup in other categories. So, our municipal trading activity has offset the declines in the
MBS, but we would see that pick up in MBS, which we think would give us a lift overall.

Okay, good. I'll step back. But thank you, guys. I appreciate it.

Hi, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I had a question on the – morning, Stacy. I had a question on the loan side. Can you just talk about borrower
sentiment today versus 90 days ago? And then just if you could elaborate on that point that the competitive
environment should be actually a tailwind for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marc. You're absolutely right about it being a tailwind for us. Given our situation with liquidity and
capital position and solid credit quality, we feel very comfortable that we are out pursuing loan opportunities
across our footprint and across our – all our lines of business. And we're trying to take advantage of some of the
peer banks that are cutting back a little bit or pulling back for their various reasons. So, that is the effort, that is the
focus of all our sales teams. And I don't think there's any particular area that we're shying away from right now. As
far as borrower sentiment goes that's – we've always been focused on customer selection. So, we're going to be
focused on ones that are well-positioned to grow or to expand during this timeframe and we'll support those
companies as we see appropriately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And, Peter, the footprint gives us a lot of tailwind too. When you about just the economic expansion that's
happening in Texas broadly. The new market we opened with San Antonio and Austin, Phoenix is doing very,
very well. Denver is hanging in there really well. So, the footprints going to give us some tailwind there too, just by
having better economic growth in the footprint states, and I think you're going to get that nationally as well. I think
the only real concern I have the risk to our guidance on loan growth really is commercial real estate. There's some
risk that as the year goes along, we get a higher elevated level of payoffs, which could mute the total loan growth
a little bit. But overall, we feel very good about the guidance that we provided given our footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And then on credit, Marc, you mentioned the healthcare. Could you just give a little bit more
color about the $40 million increase in healthcare nonperforming loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean healthcare loans now account for 17% of our overall loan portfolio. And we have an occasional loan
here or there that, we've had good management support of inside it, but things haven't progressed as they

expected and we had to put those into more of a workout situation. One of them is more of an ongoing senior
housing. One of them is more of a private pay situation. So they're not even in the same sides of the business. It's
just – we will have one-off nonperforming credits like that. It is not a reflection of anything we see systemic in the
healthcare business.
And I guess if I'm to add anything, if you look at our nonperforming loans over time, they have operated for the
last numerous quarters in a very narrow range. And if we go back and look at some quarters it's one of our other
portfolios that adds to it. If it's another quarter, it's a different portfolio. And this quarter just happened to be a
couple of one-off deals in healthcare and we'll address those and be able to manage that we believe ongoing in a
very narrow range with low charge-offs, as we've had for a number of years now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Just broadly, I mean, credit is a strength. I mean, if you look at where we are compared to pre-pandemic, we're
not quite half in terms of our criticized and classified level. Nonperforming levels are strong. I mean charge-offs
this quarter were $4 million. I mean it's – obviously not sustainable. But I think where we're positioned and where
we have performed historically, credit is very apparent that it's a strength right now. And I think as we look
forward, we still feel like in the guidance that Marty provided, we still feel pretty good that at least over the next
couple of quarters, we don't expect charge-offs to be materially elevated.

I was curious, the growth that looks pretty good. Are there a little bit better than I would have guessed. But are
you seeing people step back or risk adjusted spreads being a little bit more appropriate, they are willing to lean
into the growth? Just any color on rates you're getting as well.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
No, I think generally speaking. I mean, it depends on what segment you're looking at from a spread perspective. I
would say on the larger corporate deals there isn't some spread enhancement that's coming as a result of maybe
a liquidity premium in the marketplace that the larger banks are requiring from that perspective on the commercial
banking on the lower end. There's probably not a lot of spread enhancement that's happening there, there's still
more competition there. Part of it is mix. As the mix shifts surround over time, that can change our spreads just a
little bit because there are higher spreads and the specialty lines of business than there are in traditional C&I. But
I think what we saw is the fact that we are – we're not just open for business, but we're actively prospecting,
looking for new customers, trying to use this opportunity to grow very thoughtfully is creating opportunities for us.
And really we had several deals that kind of pushed into the first quarter. We were hopeful would have closed in
the fourth quarter. So, we're optimistic about our loan pipelines and what we're hearing from our customers and
prospects as we think about loan growth in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citi
Got you. That's helpful color. And then I know the trading businesses kind of the front end of the curve. You need
consistent spread cuts to really see that start to work or is it just kind of the implications? Any kind of thoughts on
what you might expect in terms of a cadence of, say, the forward curve is correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
I think in the trading business, even without changes in rates, that business has momentum given the investments
we've made in expanding into Memphis et cetera. And so, it would be incremental on top of what we already
expect to be a growth trend if we get forward curve plays out.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.

Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Going back to the fee discussion and I think Scott touched on this briefly with Jon's question. But just take a step
back and help us appreciate the drivers of that 2024 guidance for fees and commissions, the various components
of that through each one of your fee businesses. I think that guidance implies like a high single-digit growth in
2024. What are the major drivers and detractors of that guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Why don't I start on that, Matt? So, I think that the businesses that probably have the greatest opportunity
are in the brokerage and trading where we've made investments there and we've got great momentum in that
business. Fiduciary, asset management, I think we'll have customary growth in that business, plus we think that
asset valuations are going to give us a little bit of wind at our backs from an AUM perspective and that'll flow
through to growth rates. And then, mortgage actually has opportunity there both on the production side and on the
servicing side. And so, we expect to see good numbers out of that line of business on a percentage growth
perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Matt, this is Scott. I think that when you look at that total category as I mentioned earlier in the call, the thing that
we're pleased about is the fact that we're not seeing any one component carry the load. If you look at, multiple
quarters now and the year as a whole, we're seeing heightened levels, record levels of revenue generation across
all the categories of Wealth Management, which, as you know, is very well diversified both by product set,
customer set, geographically where we serve international market and many of those operating units. So, it's
broadly across the board where we've seen investment – historical investments in our corporate trust business
and our asset management business, the trading pieces as Marty mentioned. But all of those together and
combined are what produces the result that gives us optimism that we're not dependent upon those Fed rate cuts
to continue to see momentum and growth in the business lines.
No doubt if we see and it's less about the rate, it's more about some steepness to the curve benefits the trading
businesses because we've now been operating on a decade where we didn't have any slope to the curve, which
incents no one to go out. So if we do see some steepness in the curve, we'll see. But I think we're extremely well-
positioned if that were to shape out.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate the thoughts there, Scott. And then I guess shifting back over to the rate sensitivity, you provide
some good commentary, been relatively neutral as far as on the NII. What are your early thoughts on deposit
betas in a falling rate scenario, whether it's back half of the year or next year whenever that would be? And how
would those betas you think compare on the way down versus what we just saw on the way up at the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So given the fact that over the last couple of quarters, you've seen betas be higher, you're going to see a
mirror image of that more or less as we see rates come down in that kind of environment. I mean, as you know,
those are non-linear and so you're not going to get the same exact beta at each rate hike, but you'll see relatively
high betas on the way down, given that you've got a lot of that betas on the driven upside was, the larger
corporate and wealth balances.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Fingers crossed. And then just lastly, on the expense side, I know those expenses can be lumpy
quarter-to-quarter. I think you mentioned a few things that made it more little higher in the fourth quarter and I see
the full-year guidance. But any color on where we could start off with earlier in the year in the first quarter on the
expense side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, if you take the fourth quarter number, the $384 million and then, adjust that for the FDIC special
assessment, you get to $340 million number, so coming out of the gate, next quarter we'd expect to be a little
below that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
As Marty pointed out, Matt, I think it's important there's some BOKFI transaction costs that are embedded in some
of those line items in the fourth quarter, particularly related to personnel expense and professional fees that you
got to think about too is really being part of that sale of that business, not really part of the core run rate of the
company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So if you think through some of those unusual items and filter some of those out, you'll get taxes on wages
coming up in the first quarter, but that will net down to just a little bit low.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, everybody.

William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Great. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Will.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, Marty, I was just hoping you could help us unpack the margin story. What it looks like in both, this flat rate
environment that your guidance is predicated off of. And then maybe what the margin does if we do see, two or
three or four even six rate cuts this coming year? I know you talked about, compression next quarter, but then
maybe a stable NIM in this, in a flat rate environment. But can you see expansion in that scenario? And then I
guess just confirm, we'll certainly see NIM expansion if we do get rate cuts. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the basic trajectory that we're expecting is, margins basically level out a little bit down in the first quarter
level and then actually just a little bit up at the end of the year is how we think about it for a flat rate scenario, of
course, plus or minus, the usual drivers of noise around that trend. And then if you got a forward curve kind of
scenario playing out, that'd be modestly supportive of the margin percentage in those later quarters when that
would play out, once the steepness would start to play out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. And then where do you think we are in the noninterest bearing remix story? I know the
balances took another step down this quarter, but did you feel like we're getting close to kind of leveling out there
or how do you think about, noninterest bearing deposits into this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, the decline we saw in the fourth quarter was largely as we expected when we talked about at on our Q3
call. So for the first quarter, we do expect another decline that's a little smaller than what we saw in the fourth

quarter, but still pretty sizeable, pretty close to that size. Just as you get a combination of some of the rate driven
moves and some seasonal declines that are normal for us in as we go into Q1.
So, you'll see Q1 down another step. And then after that, our expectation is much smaller amounts of shift from
noninterest bearing into interest bearing for the next couple of quarters as we just get into the tail phase of that, as
that naturally plays out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And it feels like maybe it's been a while since those updated thoughts on bank M&A.
It feels like there could be some pushes and pulls on M&A into the coming year. Could you just update us on how
you feel, or how you generally think about M&A and in terms of – and market transactions or out of market or size,
just any kind of context you could give would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So two factors, I think. I do think rates are going to have to come down before bank M&A becomes more
realistic. You still have purchase accounting issues that are going to happen until some of the securities portfolios
and banks that would like to be acquired are better positioned, that's going to create some headwind there until
that's resolved. I think for us broadly, a large bank acquisition is going to be difficult for us to do.
There's just not a lot that would fit the profile that we're looking for. We would want to stay largely in the
geographic footprint that we're in today. We really like that. We want to continue to grow, particularly in these fast-
growing markets like Texas and continue to invest there. It's got to be of sufficient size to move the needle for us,
but there's just not a lot that fit that. We're more interested in, technology or product acquisitions that could add on
and be incremental much quicker and not distract the whole company from regulatory approval and conversion
process.
And so, I would put the odd that we find the whole bank acquisition in the next 12 months to be pretty low and we
are continuing to look for things on the product or technology side that could be accretive to us and valuable to us
long term, although there's nothing on the horizon there either.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Jones Q

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Starting on the deposit side, do you have what the deposit spot rate was at the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we don't really have a deposit spot rate per se, but our cumulative beta was 63% for the quarter and for the
month of December is 64%, so really not a lot different than the full quarter average.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then looking at expenses and trying to take into consideration some of the comments around
what happens on the fee income side if we do get rate cuts. Is the expectation that the expenses grow in an
environment where you see some higher revenues from fees? And if that is the case, is the 65% efficiency ratio in
a down rate environment still a good base or could you actually see some improvement as some of these fee
income businesses pick up some more momentum?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
I'd say broadly speaking the 65% is good, but you could see some incremental improvement from just a higher
revenue lift overall because that would just accelerate that trend.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
If you think about mortgage particularly, I mean, mortgage is probably running 90% plus efficiency today. So if you
got any lift there, you're going get a better efficiency ratio out of that line of business. So, Marty is right. I think
we're very comfortable with the forward guidance we provided there. But any benefit that we get from a lower rate
environment should be incrementally positive to our efficiency ratio.

Hi, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. So, I want to follow-up on trading NIR and what are you expecting kind of implied in your NII forecast? And
if you can kind of give us the puts and takes on how that could play out just given, Fed rate cuts potentially
occurring in the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, in our guide, we're just assuming that, that remains roughly constant throughout the year, to the extent
that you get some steepening that could be a positive for that line item, for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then I just want to follow-up on credit. So in your guidance you expect, the increase in credit
costs more towards the later part of 2024? And then you also mentioned kind of a normalized range of 30 to 40
basis points. So is it fair to assume that maybe back half of 2024 we approach that 30 basis points of net charge
offs? Is that how you're thinking about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, CEO, COO & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No, I think, we were – we're talking about our guidance it's really around provision levels not charge off levels. I do
think you could see just based on some reversion, you could see charge off levels come up a little bit in the back
half of the year. But Marc, talked a little bit about our historical charge offs. We always guide to 30 to 40 basis
points, but it's been a long time since we've seen 40 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, if we've been looking back over our history, we have been below 30 basis points of net charge offs
since 2013, it was the last year we hit 30 basis points. So we've operated mainly between, less than 10 to 20 for
the last 10 to 11 years. So right now, given where our credit is, we don't see the increased level of net charge offs
coming. But as we grow and as the economic environment changes, that will have the impact on the provision
that we have to have and the reserve we have to have. And we're going to keep make sure we continue to make
that appropriate level of that reserve reflecting those two things. But it's going to be driven by those more than it's
going to be driven by net charge offs.
