Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported full year 2019 earnings per share of $7.87, a 9% increase over
2018. Highlights for the year included driving strong loan growth, which pushed total assets to a record level,
while continuing to serve our relationship-oriented deposit base. Also, with the benefit of higher fee income,
revenue reached an all-time high. This growth, along with careful expense control, resulted in an efficiency ratio of
under 52%. In addition, credit quality remained solid, and we meaningfully reduced excess capital. Our book
value grew 10%. While we raised our dividend 46%, also our ROE increased to above 16%.
Slide 4 provides details on our 2019 results. Average loans increased 4%, including strong growth in the first two
quarters of the year. Deposit trends picked up significantly in the second half of the year, resulting in relatively
stable balances year-over-year. As far as net interest income, the benefit from loan growth and the net impact
from higher rates was offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits as well as wholesale funding.
Provision increased from a very low level in 2018, and reflected continued solid credit quality with 21 basis points
of net charge-offs or only 4 basis points excluding Energy. We repurchased 18.6 million shares during the year,

reducing our average share count by 11%, and together with an increase in our dividend returned $1.8 billion to
shareholders. In summary, we achieved record earnings per share and continued to enhance shareholder value.
Turning to slide 5, fourth quarter earnings were $269 million or $1.85 per share. These results demonstrate our
ability to drive solid returns with an ROE of nearly 15% and an ROA of 1.5% despite declines in interest rates.
Broad-based deposits and noninterest income growth, strong credit quality and continued active capital
management were positive contributors to our performance.
Compared to the third quarter, average loans remained relatively steady, as expected. Mortgage Banker
continued to benefit from robust refi activity. Also, Commercial Real Estate and Environmental Services
maintained their growth trends. This was offset by declines in general Middle Market as well as National Dealer,
which was partly due to lower inventory levels.
The tone of recent conversations I've had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic and we
continue to see slow, steady economic expansion. We are focused on employing new customer acquisitions,
cross-sell and retention strategies that we have launched over the past year, and we continue to make the
customer experience a corporate priority as we seek to raise the expectations [ph] of what they can be (00:05:10).
While loans were relatively slow, deposit growth was robust, increasing $1.5 billion relative to the third quarter,
with almost every business line contributing. The mix of the growth was favorable, with over 40% coming from
noninterest-bearing deposits. In conjunction with this growth, we have reduced higher cost broker deposits by
nearly $700 million.
Our interest-bearing deposit cost declined 7 basis points to 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. We are closely
monitoring the competition, and with recent Fed rate cut, we have taken action to adjust deposit pricing. By
carefully managing our deposit rates, we are attracting and retaining relationships. Our strategy is working and it's
clearly demonstrated by our deposit growth.
The increase in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding and helped reduce our
loan total funding cost to 71 basis points. Also, our loan to deposit ratio decreased to 88%.
Of note, the US Treasury recently announced that we will continue to be the exclusive financial intermediary for
the Direct Express government benefits card program for another five years. The economics of this program
include attractive retail deposits that should continue to grow and our ability to leverage a third-party platform for
processing and servicing.
As far as net interest income, over 80% of our loans are floating rates and primarily tied to 30-day LIBOR, which
on average declined 39 basis points during the quarter. Lower rates were the primary driver for our net interest
income decline to $544 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.2%. We added $750 million to swaps in
October and an additional $1 billion in early January. Our strategy is to continue to build our hedging program
over time, closely monitoring the markets and then taking advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter, with net charge-offs of only 16 basis points. Charge-offs
continued to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select Energy credits as capital markets for this sector
remain soft. Excluding Energy, net charge-offs were only $2 million. Nonperforming assets declined and were
only 43 basis points of total loans, and provision decreased to $8 million.

A $10 million increase in noninterest income helped offset the more challenging rate environment. We had strong
growth in customer derivative income as well as a gain from the sale of our Healthcare Savings (sic) [Health
Savings] (00:08:04) or HSA business, along with incremental growth in several other categories.
Expenses increased as expected, primarily related to higher compensation, outside processing and seasonal
occupancy. This is in line with the outlook we provided for full year expenses to remain flat, excluding 2018
restructuring costs.
We maintained our targeted 10% CET1 target. We returned $246 million in capital to shareholders through our
dividend, which currently provides almost a 4% return, and by repurchasing 2.1 million shares under our share
buyback program.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim.

Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 6, as Curt indicated, average loans were stable in the fourth quarter, with increases in
Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker and Environmental Services, offset by decreases in general Middle
Market and National Dealer. Relative to the fourth quarter last year, average loans were up $1.7 billion.
Total commitments as of the quarter end were stable compared to the third quarter, with growth in Commercial
Real Estate, Equity Fund Services, US banking and general Middle Market, offset by reductions in Energy, Dealer
and Technology and Life Sciences. Our pipeline remains solid.
Our loan yields were 4.43%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the third quarter. This was a result of lower
interest rates, primarily one-month LIBOR, in addition to a $3 million decline in nonaccrual interest from an
elevated third quarter level.
Slide 7 provides details on deposits. Average balances increased $1.5 billion, with growth across all three of our
markets. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased over $600 million, while customer interest-bearing balances
increased $1.45 billion. We've managed our higher cost broker deposits down about $700 million.
As far as deposit costs, with a decline in interest rates, we adjusted deposit pay rates throughout the quarter.
Together with a decline in broker deposits, we achieved a 7 basis point decrease in our interest-bearing deposit
costs. This is at the high-end of the guidance we had previously provided.
As you can see in slide 8, our MBS portfolio was stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady. Yields on recent
purchases have been around 2.4%. We have had a modest increase in prepays in the back half of the year, so
this has not had a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium, which remains relatively small.
Turning to slide 9, net interest income was $544 million, and the net interest margin was 3.2%. Loans had a
negative impact of $55 million or 31 basis points to the margin. The major factor was lower interest rates, which
had a $46 million impact and 28 basis points on the margin. Also contributing to the decrease for lower balances,
a decline in nonaccrual interest from elevated levels and to a larger extent, other portfolio dynamics, including
lower loan fees.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Fed deposits added $3 million but had a 7 basis point negative impact to the margin. Higher balances added $7
million, and resulted in a 5 basis point drag on the margin. The lower Fed rate had an impact of [ph] $4 million
(00:11:46) or 2 basis points. Lower rates improved deposit cost by $3 million or 2 basis points on the margin, and
reduced wholesale funding cost by $7 million, adding 4 basis points to the margin.
In summary, given the nature of our portfolio, our loans were priced [indiscernible] (00:12:06). Therefore, the net
impact of lower rates, including the full quarter impact of the July and September rate cuts along with October's
was the primary driver of our net interest income in the fourth quarter. Assuming rates remain steady going
forward, we believe the bulk of impact from lower rates is behind this.
Credit quality was strong as shown in slide 10. Our net charge-offs were $21 million or 16 basis points. Excluding
Energy, net charge-offs were only $2 million. Total nonperforming assets declined to 43 basis points, one of the
lowest levels since 2006, and criticized loans comprised only 4% of total loans as of quarter end. As far as
Energy, while charge-offs were lower in the fourth quarter than the previous two quarters, we continue to see
impairment of select Energy loans with valuations of a few liquidating Energy assets impacted by volatile oil and
gas prices as well as weak capital markets.
Energy nonaccrual loans decreased $31 million; however, we have seen a moderate amount of negative
migration as criticized Energy loans increased $146 million. Therefore, we increased our reserve for Energy,
which remains at a very healthy level. Our reserve ratio for total loans held steady at 1.27% and resulted in a
provision of $8 million, a decline of $27 million from the third quarter. As far as our adoption of CECL as of
January 1, our implementation process has been successful and it's virtually complete. Given the relatively short
duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and the expectation of a fairly benign economic environment, we
expect the change in reserve will be a decrease of 0% to 5%; and therefore, will have little impact on our capital
ratios.
Noninterest income increased $10 million as shown on slide 11. Customer derivative income increased $7 million,
including the rate impact on the credit valuation adjustment. Commercial lending fees increased $2 million with
robust syndication activity. We also had small increases in several other categories, including investment banking,
brokerage fees, and securities trading. This was partly offset by a $5 million decrease in card fees as a result of
the mix shift in the transaction volumes of government cards, as well as two fewer business days in the quarter
impacting corporate and merchant card volumes. Also fiduciary income decreased $1 million, mainly due to tax
preparation fees received in the third quarter. During the quarter, we sold our HSA business for a gain of $6
million. Of note, deferred comp asset returns, which were offset in noninterest expenses, were $3 million, the
same level as the third quarter.
Turning to expenses on slide 12. Salaries and benefits increased $4 million. This was a result of higher incentive
compensation and commissions tied to performance as well as seasonal healthcare expense. In addition, outside
processing increased $4 million due to a vendor transition fee, and seasonality drove a $2 million increase in
occupancy expenses as well as several other categories. We continue to carefully manage costs as we invest for
the future as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of 55%, which is well below the third quarter peer average. In the
fourth quarter, we repurchased $150 million or 2.1 million shares under our share repurchase program as shown
on slide 13. Together with dividends, we returned $246 million to shareholders. Our goal is to continue to return
excess capital back to shareholders and maintain our CET1 ratio at approximately 10%.
Turning to the rate environment on slide 14. Assuming interest rates remain at the current levels, the net impact
from rates is estimated to be $10 million to $15 million on our first quarter net interest income relative to the fourth
quarter. This includes the full quarter effect of the recent Fed cuts combined with the actions we've taken to lower

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
deposit rates. Of course, actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors, such as LIBOR movements. As
far as the remaining three quarters of 2020, if rates hold steady, we expect to see a relatively smaller residual
effect from rates as longer-dated assets and liabilities re-price.
In addition, continued hedging activity triggered the modest negative impact. We continue to work to gradually
moderate our asset sensitivity. We added $750 million to our hedging portfolio in October and $1 billion in early
January. We currently have about $5.5 billion in interest rate swaps with an average remaining tenor of about
three years and are currently in the money. Overall, we remain positive and constructive on the US economy, and
we plan to make steady progress in building our hedging portfolio over time.
Slide 15 provides our outlook for 2020, which assumes a continuation of the current rate and economic
environment. We expect average loans to grow approximately 2% to 3% in 2020 relative to 2019. We anticipate
continued slow, steady economic expansion, yielding growth in most business lines. This is expected to be partly
offset by decline in Mortgage Banker from elevated levels as refi volumes normalize and a modest reduction in
National Dealer Services driven by a predicted reduction in auto sales.
As far as the first quarter, we expect loan growth for most business lines will be mostly offset by a decline in
Mortgage Banker due to seasonality combined with the slowdown in refi activity.
We expect average deposit growth of 1% to 2%. We believe we will have a normal seasonality through the year,
including the typical first quarter decline. Our goal is to continue to attract and retain long-term customer
relationships by offering superior products and services along with the appropriate pricing. As I discussed in the
previous slide, the rate impact on net interest income is expected to be mostly absorbed in the first quarter, with
an additional modest effect for the remainder of the year. Also, the [ph] full year expense of (00:18:45) higher
wholesale funding will have an impact.
In addition, we expect a $6 million to $8 million decrease in nonaccrual interest recoveries from the elevated level
we saw in 2019. Loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset. We believe our portfolio will continue to
perform well, resulting in net charge-offs similar to 2019 in the 15 to 25-basis-point range. Given the new CECL
accounting standards which became effective January 1 and assuming the current economic backdrop, we
expect provision should be slightly above net charge-offs after taking into consideration our loan growth outlook.
Note that this new standard may cause greater volatility in our provision.
As far as noninterest income, we expect growth of about 1% led by card and fiduciary fees. Our expectation
includes declines in certain fee categories that had strong growth in 2019, such as customer derivative and
warrant income. Also deferred comp, which totaled $9 million in 2019, is hard to predict and is not assumed to
repeat. As far as the first quarter, keep in mind that the fourth quarter included a gain on the sale of the HSA
business. In addition, we've a strong derivative income and syndication fees as well as deferred comp of $3
million, all of which are dependent on market conditions and therefore may not continue at these levels.
Expenses are expected to increase approximately 3% year-over-year. We expect to see a rise in outside
processing tied to fee income growth and increasing technology investments as we execute on revenue and
efficiency related projects that are employed. In addition, we expect inflationary pressures on items such as
annual merit, staff insurance and marketing. As a result of lower discount rate, pension expense is increasing
about $7 million. Also recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense due to annual share
compensation and associated higher payroll taxes which are expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower
marketing and occupancy expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%, and as far as
capital, we expect to maintain our CET1 target of approximately 10%.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. The outlook we've provided reflects our expectations for continued moderate year of expansion
through 2020. A cooler global economy and the strong value to dollar remain headwinds for US trade. However,
many sources of uncertainty that are accumulated through 2019 such as China, Mexico and Canadian trade
agreements have been or might soon be resolved. The interest rate environment looks stable for the year ahead
and the labor market in the US remains strong and will continue to support the consumer sector. We believe this
backdrop should benefit us and our customers as the year progresses.
Over our 170-year history, we have managed through many economic and interest rate cycles. With our efficiency
ratio in the mid-50s and an ROE of nearly 15%, we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or
interest rate environment. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control to maintain our solid
performance. Our 2019 results demonstrate our ability to grow revenue while maintaining favorable credit metrics
and well controlled expenses.
Our key strengths provide the foundation to continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. Specifically, our
geographic footprint which includes faster-growing diverse markets combined with our relationship banking
strategy is expected to result in growth of loans, deposits and fee income. We continue to maintain our proven
expense discipline as we invest for the future. Also our conservative, consistent approach to banking including
credit and capital management has positioned us well.
Now, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess, why don't we start off in terms of the NII outlook, I just want to make sure I really understand what you're
trying to say here. The way I read it is that first quarter is obviously down $10 million to $15 million and then the
rate impact is going to be negative on NII. So, dollars go lower in each subsequent quarter throughout 2020, but
then you have – presumably you have the asset growth offset to that. Are you trying to say that NII from a dollar
basis is going to be lower than first quarter throughout the year or like how do you see the net impact of all the
different factors affecting NII after first quarter? Thanks.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, you can...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. We will see progressively lower impact from rate as we go through the year. I
mentioned the $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter. It will be a much smaller amount in the second
quarter. As of now it might be, call it, $5 million to $7 million range and then it becomes closer to a negligible
number in the third and fourth quarter, even though we will see some impact all the way through the year. And of
course, I had mentioned to the extent we have hedges and depending on the rates there, that will obviously have
an impact also. We'll obviously pick up the volume as the year goes on and you heard me mention the nonaccrual
impact that overall will be an impact on 2020 compared to 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Sorry. I guess because you – I'm sure you guys do very detailed modeling for the year, is it right to assume that
your NII, if you look at say fourth quarter of 2020, is that going to be lower or higher than first quarter of 2020?

You should see volume overtake rate once we get beyond the first quarter to answer your question. So, most of
that rate impact is felt in the first quarter and then, you are right, volume does start to step up and the rate impact
starts to decline. So, you'll start to see a crossover once you get into the second and third quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. That's helpful. I guess maybe just like a second question, in terms of fee income, you
mentioned I guess in your guidance that that assumes kind of – I think it's essentially no – what is the right word,
no returns on deferred compensation assets and that's part of the assumptions driving your 1%. Can you just
explain that and is it possible that your fee growth is more than 1% if you do get returns on those assets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, obviously, deferred comp is a bit of a wildcard, it depends on the market and the market returns on deferred
comp. So, it can actually be positive or negative. So, I'd be very hesitant to assume there's going to be any kind of
return there. In fact it could go in the other direction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it, understood. Okay. And then, just one – if I can sneak one last one in, in terms of your loan growth,
obviously 2% to 3%, I think last quarter you talked about something around nominal GDP and I guess my
interpretation of nominal GDP was closer to 4%. Can you just comment are you seeing weakness or any kind of
deterioration. I mean, presumably you're seeing some weakness in your expectation for loan growth this quarter
versus last quarter and what's driving that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President-Business Bank, Comerica Bank (Dallas, Texas)
Hey, Ken. This is Peter. I think the 2% to 3% that we've communicated, we feel good about. We have seen a little
bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter and I think we listed the businesses that – where we've seen that, there
have been some sort of interesting timing on what we've had in Dealer and Mortgage. But going into 2020, we
feel good about our ability to accomplish the 2% to 3% that we've communicated.

Hello, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Good morning. And then also on the NII topic, so I guess this outlook implies probably that we've
got some incremental compression in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. And then, could you talk about
10


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
how the margin should progress beyond that? Is it fair to assume stable or some incremental compression from
there as we move through second, third and fourth quarter of 2020? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, happy to answer that. We have a couple of factors that will be netting against each other. We didn't
know that we have about 5 bps of compression due to the higher balances as the excess liquidity that you saw in
the fourth quarter, but even if you net against that the $10 million to $15 million guidance that I offered in the first
quarter and progressively smaller amounts after that. And so, if you do the simple math on that, it would imply a
modest reduction from the current 3.20%. Having said that, we're always hesitant to provide NIM percentage
guidance just because it is so impacted by excess liquidity which based on our customer profile is very hard to
predict.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, got it. And then on the expense front, you indicate in your guidance that your expense outlook is impacted
in part by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue and you mentioned in your comments, too, it
seems like maybe fee revenue. Can you talk about what that is?
And then separately, can you talk about what expense levers you may have incrementally as you look at 2020
given the tougher revenue backdrop and any consideration for pulling back even harder on the expense side?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim will start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, very specific to the outside processing fees. So, we actually do have some good core growth in a number
of line items in 2020, one of those is card income, and of course, we have associated outside processing fees
with that. Now, some of these strong core line item growth areas that we have will be offset by some of the items
that I mentioned. The very strong year we had in 2019 with syndications, warrants, derivatives, and of course, the
deferred comp item that we talked about earlier, but we do expect a strong card year, and we will have some
outside processing fees associated with that.
Regarding your second question on were to we pullback, we are always very focused on expense control. I think
we have to keep in mind that we're starting again from a very strong position with 55% efficiency ratio. But we do
feel it's important to make the proper investments in technology and make sure that we're pushing forward in
terms of moving the company where it needs to be. So, we are going to continue to invest in technology and don't
anticipate pulling back on that at this point in time.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody.

Hey, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
The follow-up first on John's question on expenses. So, if you look at the 3% expected increase in 2020, is there
anything unusual you would call out? I mean, pension sounded like it was $7 million or do you think that's a good
run rate for the company here as you continue to reinvest?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Pension would be the only real unusual item there. I would say normal inflation including merits would be
the largest item, so nothing too unique in terms of what makes up that expense base. Going forward, I'd be
hesitant to call that a run rate. What we're really focused on is really operating leverage going forward. We do
have a bit of a transition here with some of the pension expense and some of the strong noninterest income
headwinds that we talked about earlier. But we're really more focused on positive operating leverage and that's
where we expect to get in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And I just was looking for color, you guys put up really strong growth in deposits in the
quarter. Give more color on why we're so strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. It was a very strong quarter. We're very pleased with it. We talked about being up $1.5 billion, but keep in
mind we ran off about $700 million of brokered CDs. So, the way I look at it is we actually are up about $2.2 billion
or so on deposits. So, we're very pleased there. It's a very concerted effort to go out and [ph] deposit gather, re-
priced (00:32:01) appropriately where we needed to. These are relationships that we poured into the bank, none
of these were standalone deposits. I will say that probably at least half of this is seasonal and it's always hard to
tell when this money might bleed out during the first quarter, but approximately half, maybe a little half from what I
can tell is seasonal, but there is a strong component of it that I think is core and will stick with us through the year
even if we see a minor decline in the first quarter.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
And this is Curt. I might add, Steven, that the relationship component that Jim talked about we've made a
deliberate strategy not to try chase sort of hot money or transactional deposits that have really leveraged our
deposit pricing and programs that we had in place like our CD program, around new client acquisition and
acquiring additional deposits from existing customers, which I think is the right strategy for us longer term and
very consistent with our relationship-based approach.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one final one, Curt, your comments recently about Comerica potentially being an
acquirer got quite a bit of attention. I'm curious, are you actively having conversations with [ph] Targets

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Steven, I think maybe first thing I would say is that if you read the text of anything that has been written on
me, there's no change in any of our strategy. There are few headlines that maybe were I think a little bit
misleading. And we are very focused on organic growth as we have been for a long time. We've done two
acquisitions in the last 20 years and what we've said and what I've said and Ralph before me is that if there's
something that makes sense in Texas and California that would be a good strategic fit and [ph] were in (00:33:56)
one of the major metropolitan areas and make the right economics for our company and for our shareholders,
we'll take a look at it, but that land is fairly narrow. And so, for the day in and day out, we continue to focus on
organic growth.

Pete?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Jennifer, so we're guiding 75 to 125 basis points in charge-offs, and if you take a look at 2019, only 4 basis
points of ex-Energy charge-offs, we don't think that's sustainable. So, we would expect that ex-Energy, we would
see slightly higher charge-offs than what we saw in 2019, and we're hopeful that that could be offset fully or at
least partially by lower Energy charge-offs. So, that remains to be seen, but that's where we get the outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
No, we're really not. Four basis points of ex-Energy charge-offs in 2019, only $2 million in net charge-off ex-
Energy in the fourth quarter, our nonaccrual levels are at very low levels, and that includes Energy. So, we're
seeing a lot of strength, particularly in the $48 billion of the portfolio that is ex-Energy.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sorry about that. So, how much was your technology spending last year, how much do you think it will increase
and what are the areas of technology spending focused?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. We – Jim, you want to start on that and then I'll add in around – on the areas of focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Mike, we don't quote a specific number on technology spending simply because it's so difficult and
challenging to get in apples and apples work with other banks and define exactly what falls in the technology
bucket. But I will say we have a – as implied in the expense outlook for 2020, we do have a modest increase in
technology expense in 2020 over and beyond the strong spend in 2019. So, it is something that we continue to
invest in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I might just add to that Mike that we've talked before about the GEAR Up initiative having positioned us well from
an overall technology spend. We did a lot of work in the last several years to rationalize many of our applications,
improve our aging platforms. I think we've been a leader in terms of the cloud migration, especially in
noncustomer interfacing applications and there's a lot of the work we have done around that has helped free up
capacity for us for new projects in the last 12 months that has included a new across the company loan origination
and servicing platform, a new companywide CRM platform, major investments in data analytics to help us in the
marketing and servicing of our clients, major upgrades to our call center technology.
And then, for 2020 a number of key areas of focus in items that will be coming online related to upgrades to our
ATMs, major upgrades to our baking center infrastructure and technology, including enabling all of our employees
in the banking center with tablets to make them more mobile in their selling and servicing efforts, a pretty major
upgrade to our onboarding capabilities on the digital side for our consumer prospecting customers, and then fairly
significant upgrades to the treasury management platform in the payments area as well as a new portal for our
Wealth Management clients. So, we continue to be very focused on things that I'd put in a category of colleague

and customer enable it, and like most institutions, we have a longer term roadmap we're working on, but we feel
like we are well-positioned relative to our competitors in providing really good experience to our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then one follow-up, I assume you would employ many vendors to help you with this transformation. What
took place with the vendor transition costs? I guess, you always have a balance getting vendors to help you
facilitate the transition, on the other hand, there's always the risk of vendor lock-in, and during this quarter, you
had a vendor transition cost. But can you describe the analysis that goes into selecting vendors? How you
prepare against too much vendor lock-in versus the goal of transforming the company faster?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I'd like to take the sort of second part of your question and then I'll turn to Jim for the more specifics around the
expense in the quarter. We do have a number of key vendor relationships like most institutions, given
[indiscernible] (00:40:42) organization we are, we try to strike the right balance between proprietary capability and
leveraging third-parties where it makes sense. Those third-parties go through the exact same oversight process
that we do as if we were building something or servicing something in house, including robust [ph] cyber
(00:41:00) oversight. And we believe we've got really good relationships that we can leverage and we try to get to
a good point in terms of balance and trying to help concentration issues with any one single vendor.
So, Jim, you maybe want to talk about the specifics around the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that other than size, there is actually nothing real unusual about this vendor transition. We're
always evaluating our vendors to do the right thing to both ourselves and the customers. It's been unusual for us
to have a vendor transition. This one was a little bit larger, but it's something that we're always evolving on in
terms of looking at both quality and cost and capabilities. And I would just say that this is a one-time cost that
though larger than typical, it's not unusual. We have had vendor transitions really every year and sometimes
multiple times within a year. So, that's – I think there's probably not a lot more to that other than the size.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Question on the deposit cost side of things. You mentioned that you saw the 7 basis
point decline in costs, and just wondering, what happens from here in a stable rates environment. How much do
you continue to have of just natural resetting in deposit costs versus what else from here would have to be more
negotiated with – across the customer base as you've talked about in the past? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, happy to answer that. We did re-price deposits throughout the fourth quarter as I've mentioned. So,
even though we saw the 7 basis points decline in the fourth quarter, I would expect a continued decline in the first
quarter just based off the efforts undertaken thus far. The change in the first quarter will be a smaller amount than
the 7 bps that we saw in the fourth quarter. I'd probably characterize it based on actions taken to date as being
kind of the lower single digits of bps, but we'll see where things play out there.
The two things that – two or three things [ph] that would cause a (00:43:19) further reduction, one is we did see
some mix shifts in the fourth quarter. The actions that we actually took in the fourth quarter probably would imply
a little larger [ph] bp reduction, but (00:43:30) we did see some of our relationship deposits grow related to some
of the higher priced accounts. So whether or not some of that mix shifts unwinds remains to be seen, but that
could be a tailwind.
Then, I would say it really depends on the competition and what happens in the competitive landscape. I've seen
a little bit of follow the leader out there in terms of deposit pricing. And I think that in turn for the industry will be
driven by loan growth and the demand for funding. That's certainly true specific to Comerica, but I think larger
picture, it affects the entire industry, and we're not immune from that. So, we'll continue to watch the competitive
landscape and do the right thing for our customers and for our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And one more question just on the mix of earning assets. With all this good deposit growth that you have, a
lot of it ended up just sitting in cash. And unfortunately, 10-years still at [ph] 1.80% or so (00:44:26). So, how do
you start to think about if this deposit growth continues or hangs around, does it just stay in cash or given not
much of an optionality versus securities book or do you start to flush it back into the securities book over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, we do expect some of these deposits [ph] late in Q1 (00:44:44), as we mentioned, the seasonality factor
both in Q4 and the typical Q1 seasonality, so how much liquidity – an excess liquidity we have remains to be
seen. To the extent we do have excess liquidity, I would say it really depends on the interest rate landscape. In
general, we are happy with the size of our securities portfolio and the curve is flat enough, but there's not a lot of
percentage in tying up that liquidity at this point in time. That's something we will continue to monitor, but I would
not anticipate growing our securities book in terms of size at this point in time.

Hi, good morning.

Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up to your response to Steve's earlier question on operating leverage.
Obviously, in 2020, given the poor comparison to 2019 NII, that's obviously quite difficult. But is the message that
as we look out into 2020 and 2021, there's more flexibility for the expense growth to be less than 3% or at least
you have more levers to pull it lower than revenue growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
So, Erika, this is Curt. I would say that when you look at the history of our company, especially the last year, we
definitely have had a pretty good expense discipline. You look at the performance metrics, they really are the top
of our peer group and we expect them to be near the top of our peer group once everybody reports, especially the
efficiency ratios. So we know how to manage expenses. We've done a good job of that in our history. We remain
very focused on expense management.
There are a few dynamics in play in 2020 that Jim talked about. And we are going to continue to strike the right
balance between managing expenses and invest in the things that we need to invest in longer term to help our
customers and to serve our customers appropriately and to grow the institution. But you should expect for us
longer term to remain focused on positive operating leverage, and there's always additional levers that we can
pull. We don't believe strategically that sometimes those are the right things to do, and again, striking the right
balance between investing in technology and things of that nature, and [ph] it's for the overall expense growth
(00:47:13) numbers.

Got it. And my second question is, you bought back almost $1.4 billion worth of stock, which really helped in a
year when the Fed cut three times. And with the CET1 ratio just 14 basis points above target, how should we
think about buyback appetite in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. For us, it's a pretty simple target in terms of we're simply calibrating what we need to support our loan
growth, support our dividend and then calibrate that against earnings generation. And the goal is simply to come
as close to 10% as we can, and we've been in that ballpark for the last two quarters, and I would anticipate
staying plus or minus to that 10% throughout 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And just as a follow-up question, I think I ask you this every quarter, but can you just remind us what is your
actual capital binding constraint, because I'm sure a lot of peer or a lot of investors look at the CET1 and it's a 150
basis points above the targets of some much larger regional banks, but if you could remind us what your actual
binding constraint is on capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, there's a couple ways of looking at that. If you look at it from a pure stress testing standpoint, the binding
constraint would be Tier 1. We, obviously, don't have [ph] referred in our stack (00:48:40). There is another way of
looking at it and that is we're always conscious of our constituents, rating agencies, regulators, customers. And
from that standpoint, the CET1 is a very important ratio, too. So I'm not sure I could say there is just one binding
constraint. It depends on what perspective you're looking at it from.

low double-digit – I'm sorry, just to clarify, the low double-digit and mid double digit ROEs, and we expect to stay
in that range in the foreseeable future. Interest rates will be a significant impact and driver there, so we'll see

Good morning. I had a couple of questions, one on the Energy book. As you gave your guidance for loan growth
in 2020, obviously, you highlighted Dealer Services and Mortgage. I'm curious with the pretty significant decline
this quarter in E&P and what seems to be still kind of a challenging outlook for that segment, what the appetite is
for new lending in that space in 2020?

Yeah, Gary, this is Peter. So, I mean, our appetite is that we are still looking for opportunities, but I would say that
they're more limited in this environment that we're in. We're not seeing a whole lot of deal flow, you're seeing
consolidation in this space, not a lot of capital coming into it. But we're continuing to be a very important energy
lender in this space. We've got really good relationships. We're going to support our customers. And to the extent
there's new opportunities that make sense for us, we're pursuing them.

I was just wondering, I was looking at average loan growth, it seemed to have weakened a little bit from the mid-
quarter update. And I'm just wondering what drove that and what gives you the confidence of the 2% to 3% loan
growth in 2020, because first quarter is going to start off kind of flattish?

Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President-Business Bank, Comerica Bank (Dallas, Texas)
Yeah. I would just remind you again, for last year, we had 4% year-over-year loan growth, it felt really good. It was
across kind of most of our businesses. In the first part of the year, we really saw good loan growth in the Middle
Market. And I think as we got into the second half of the year, we saw a little bit – really in California and Michigan
where Middle Market slowed down a little bit, but nothing that overly concerned us. Texas continued to perform
really well.
So as we go into next year, we feel like our pipelines in Middle Market in those markets look really good and we
feel good about our specialty businesses. Again, we did see a little bit of [ph] dial back (00:53:27) in Dealer at the
end of the quarter. Our [ph] EFS business dialed back (00:53:30) a little bit, but we still feel really good about
those going into 2020, and feel like we're going to be able to achieve that 2% to 3% that we've communicated.

Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then on a separate note, just one housekeeping. The guidance for net interest income in the first
quarter of down $10 million to $15 million, that does not include one less day count, which I think is about $6
million to $7 million, is that right?

James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That is correct, yeah. We were simply guiding on the rate impact when we mentioned the $10 million to $15
million, so you're absolutely right, there will be the one day impact.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Lana.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Good morning. I just have a couple of cleanup questions; one, on the fee income side. The expectations for
growth in 2020 from the fiduciary side, it was kind of flat in 2019, what's driving growth expectations in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Fiduciary specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Yeah. I think that was one of the drivers of the fee income growth in 2020, card and fiduciary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, I would say a couple of things related to fiduciary. One, that's a business that we've been in for a
long time and a business in which we have scale, both in serving our existing clients. We're in the institutional
trust business as well, and then we have a third party trust platform where we provide trust services for many of
the larger broker dealers in the US. And so we see growth opportunities kind of across all of these various
buckets.
Fiduciary is also one of those categories that is impacted by the market and so optimistic outlook on the equity
and bond markets for 2020, the flattish nature to 2019, nothing unusual there. We did have some repositioning
with a number of different customers. But over time, that's a business that we have grown nicely and we would
see sort of normal growth in 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2020
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. Thank you. And the second question is, can you remind me do you have a target dividend payout ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
We do not. Our goal with the dividend is simply to make sure that it is sustainable. That's really where our focus
is. And obviously, you don't want the dividend payout ratio to get too high if you have a, what I'll call, a normal
income stream, which [indiscernible] (00:56:15) to be somewhat normal right now. So, simply sustainable, strong
and we're comfortable where it is right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I guess just to add to that, obviously, the last four or five years we've had very nice growth in dividend and return
to our shareholders. So, we've been very focused on that. And [ph] you'd expect rate of growth in the (00:56:36)
dividend to start to slow out in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey guys. This is Vilas Abraham for Brock. Just a quick question on CECL, if you guys could just give a little bit
more color on the day two impact, how are you thinking about that and maybe specifically as it relates to the
Energy portfolio? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. So, the day two impact with regard to Energy, we have to look at a couple of different factors. One is not
just our – the economic forecasts, but how the economic forecast would impact Energy specifically. And so, we
would expect that there would be modest growth in our reserves for Energy, just like it would be under the
incurred model, but we don't expect CECL would impact that to any larger degree than what we see under the
incurred model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, got it. That's it for me. Thanks.
