Let me now turn it over Steve.

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading
people-first, digitally-powered bank in the nation. We continue to execute against the strategic vision and are
pleased with our progress to-date. We see significant opportunities ahead of us as we position our businesses for
the recovery at hand. Over the past year, we updated our multiyear strategic plan with the focus on driving long-
term revenue growth, continuing to build our brand based on best-in-class products and increasing our industry-
leading customer satisfaction across our businesses.
We also announced the planned acquisition of TCF Financial, which will provide a powerful opportunity to grow
revenue, expand our market presence and provide scale to our businesses while increasing our investments in
digital and other areas. This combination will increase our capacity to invest and we will become more efficient
with the significant expected expense take-outs. We accelerated our digital investments as part of our strategic
vision and are encouraged by the digital adoption trends. Due to the investments we've already made for the first
time over half of new customer deposit accounts were originated digitally in the last quarter. The double-digit
growth in active digital and mobile engagement is similarly encouraging.
As we look ahead, we're optimistic about a strong economic recovery. Unemployment has decreased significantly
across our footprint. We're again hearing a crescendo of commentary from our customers regarding labor
constraints and wage inflation. Consumer confidence has meaningfully improved. On average, consumers are
less leveraged and more liquid. Our debit card trends have consistently posted double-digit year-over-year growth
rates for the past several quarters.
Consumer spending in service industries is expected to broadly accelerate this year as demand returns.
Consumer loan production also continues to be strong. On the commercial side, sentiment is encouraging. Our
pipelines are up across the board, increasing our confidence and recovery in commercial loan demand later this
year. While supply chain constraints such as the semiconductor shortages will likely challenge some
manufacturers in the near term, progress of recovery and visibility into growing customer orders are causing
outlooks to strengthen.
Let me also share some high-level remarks on our first quarter results which provided a strong start to the year
and included solid core performance with our momentum building. Commercial loan originations were in line with
expectations. However, our overall growth was constrained by both forgiveness of PPP loans and continued
headwinds in dealer floor plan and commercial line utilization, both of which are temporary challenges.
Residential mortgage, auto and RV marine produced seasonally strong originations in face of tight inventory.
Growth in consumer loan balances was obscured by unprecedented levels of pay-downs following the two recent
round of stimulus. Deposit growth continues to consistently exceed expectations.
Finally on slide 4, I'd like to get an update on the pending TCF acquisition. We believe the timing could not be
better as the strengthening recovery dovetails with the growth and scale opportunities presented by this
combination. We continue to make good progress toward our anticipated closing late in the second quarter and to
complete the majority of system conversions late in the third quarter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
In March, Huntington and TCF shareholders approved the transaction and our integration plan is on track. We
completed the selection of key management and anticipate receiving the outstanding regulatory approvals,
including the required branch divestiture in the coming weeks. We've begun major components of the cost
reduction plan, including the closure of 44 Meijer branches later this quarter.
Now, let me turn it over to Zach for more details on our financial performance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We
reported earnings per common share of $0.48, return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average
tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom line results were augmented by two notable items, the first was a
$144 million mark-to-market benefit on our interest rate caps driven by the steepening yield curve and increased
market volatility.
The second was a $125 million or 7% reserve release resulting from the improving economic outlook and credit
metrics. Partially offsetting these were $21 million of TCF acquisition-related expenses, which were broken out as
a significant item in the earnings release with granularity provided in Table 8.
Now let's turn to slide 6 to review our results in more detail. We continue to be pleased with our sustained growth
in pre-tax, pre-provision earnings which increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total revenue
increased 19% versus the year-ago quarter. Net interest income grew 23% driven by solid underlying loan growth
and the 34-basis-point increase in NIM, which were positively impacted by the substantial mark-to-market gain
that I mentioned in our interest rate cap derivatives and the $44 million of accelerated PPP loan fee accretion.
Fee income growth of 9% was aided by a record first quarter for mortgage banking income as salable mortgage
originations set its own record with 89% year-over-year growth and secondary marketing spreads remained
elevated. Similarly, our wealth and investment management businesses experienced its best quarter ever with
respect to net asset flows and also benefited from positive equity market performance over the prior 12 months.
Card and payments continued to post strong consistent growth. Deposit service charges remained below the
year-ago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continued to moderate the recovery of this line.
Total expenses were higher by $141 million or 22% from the year-ago quarter. 3 percentage points of this growth
can be attributed to the approximately $21 million of significant items related to the TCF acquisition. There were
also approximately $45 million of expenses in the quarter or approximately 7 percentage points of growth
resulting from the pull-forward of these three expenses that otherwise would have been incurred in the future, the
first of which was a $25 billion contribution to The Columbus Foundation.
Second, we moved our annual long-term incentive grants to March from the historical timing in May. Third, we
retimed some expense related to our colleagues' health savings accounts, which would otherwise have been
incurred in the balance of 2021. These two compensation-related items together totaled approximately $20
million. The remaining approximately 11.5% underlying expense growth rate was driven primarily by the
accelerated investment and strategic growth initiatives, which we have been communicating for the past several
quarters.
Turning to slide 7, FTE net interest income increased 23% as earning asset growth was coupled with year-over-
year NIM expansion. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin increased 54 basis points to 3.48%. As shown
in the reconciliation on the right side of this slide, the linked-quarter increase primarily reflected the 49-basis-point

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
net change in the interest rate caps. As we've discussed previously, we're taking actions on both sides of the
balance sheet to offset the inherent margin pressure caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment,
managing the underlying core net interest margin near current levels.
Given the significant impact on NIM from the interest rate caps, slide 8 provides additional information on this
aspect of our comprehensive hedging strategy. As we disclosed in December, we purchased $5 billion of interest
rate caps with an average tenure of seven years to reduce impacts on capital from rising rates. This hedging
action performed very well this quarter.
In March, we subsequently sold $3 billion of new interest rate caps at a higher strike price to create a collar-like
position. This is expected to dampen further mark-to-market impacts and recover approximately half of the
premium paid on the initial caps, while maintaining the majority of the capital protection from the position.
Turning to slide 9, average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven
by the $6 billion of PPP loans and the $5 billion increase in deposits with the Fed. Average commercial and
industrial loans increased 11% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked-quarter
basis, C&I loans decreased 1%, primarily reflecting the forgiveness of PPP loans and the decline in dealer floor
plan utilization. As we indicated at the RBC Conference in March, commercial loan pipelines remain up
significantly from year ago and we're seeing that manifest in new commercial loan production.
Residential mortgage, RV and Marine, all posted year-over-year growth in new production. Average consumer
loan balances declined sequentially as stimulus-related pay-downs more than offset strong new production in the
quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $2 billion or 9% increase
in average securities as we executed our previously announced plans to deploy excess liquidity through the
purchase of securities during the quarter.
Turning to slide 10, we will review deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 20% year-over-
year and 4% sequentially, driven by increased consumer liquidity levels related to the downturn. Consumer
growth largely related to stimulus increased account production and reduced attrition.
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP forgiveness and expectations for the current program. In total, Huntington
approved $6.6 billion of PPP loans in the original program and has approved an additional $1.8 billion of loans in
the current program. In light of the recent congressional extension of the program and our current application
activity, we now anticipate the total amount for the current round to reach approximately $2 billion. We continue to
expect approximately 85% of those balances from the original program and the new program ultimately to be
forgiven. Through the end of March, $2.4 billion of loans from the original tranche have been forgiven, and we
anticipate approximately $2.3 billion will be forgiven during the second quarter. For the current program, we
expect the majority of the forgiveness to occur this year, particularly in the second half of the year.
Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The tangible common equity ratio or
TCE ended the quarter at 7.11%, down 5 basis points sequentially. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1
ended up the quarter at 10.33%, up 33 basis points from the last quarter.
The CET1 ratio is modestly above our 9% to 10% operating guideline. And we feel it's prudent to maintain strong
capital levels going into the TCF acquisition. It also positions us well to execute on our growth initiatives and
investment opportunities going forward. As we have previously communicated, we've paused share repurchases
until we have substantially completed the TCF acquisition and integration.

Slide 13 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses. The first quarter included a $125 million reserve
release, primarily from consumer. While the quarter-end ACL represents 2.17% of loans and 2.33% of loans
excluding PPP. We believe this is a prudent level to address remaining economic uncertainty while reflecting the
improved overall credit metrics and economic outlook.
Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance
continued to strengthen. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 32 basis points of average loans and leases,
slightly below the low-end of our average through the cycle target range from 35 to 55 basis points. Our criticized
asset and NPA ratios were both relatively stable. As always, we have provide additional granularity by portfolio in
the analyst package and the slides.
I want to spend a minute on our ongoing investments and progress on digital engagement and origination.
Looking at slide 15, we continue to invest in a focused set of strategic initiatives to drive revenue acceleration and
competitive differentiation. In addition to a variety of digital and product investments, we are adding personnel in
core revenue generating roles to support strategic growth in our capital markets, specialty banking, Small
Business Administration and vehicle finance businesses. We've also increased marketing spend back to pre-
pandemic levels and to promote new launches related to the Fair Play banking.
Slide 16 illustrates several key digital engagement and origination trends, showing some of the benefits of our
ongoing tech investments. On the left side of the slide, you can see continued growth in monthly digital
engagement and usage levels in Consumer and Business Banking. The digital origination trends on the right side
of the slide are particularly encouraging as they show strong customer uptick of the new consumer and business
digital origination capabilities we introduced over the course of the last year. We are executing robust technology
roadmaps across our business lines that will drive sustainable revenue momentum, via improved customer
acquisition, retention and deepening.
Finally, slide 17 provides our updated expectations for the full year 2021 on a Huntington standalone basis. We
now expect full-year average loan growth of 1% to 3%, down slightly from prior expectations as a result of the
elevated levels of pay-downs and the delayed recovery of commercial and vehicle floor plan line utilization.
These expectations reflect flat to modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of PPP and low-single-digit growth
in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see low-single-digit growth in both. For deposits, we now
expect full-year average balance growth of 9% to 11%, higher than previous expectations given the stronger than
anticipated deposit inflows in the first quarter and the overall elevated levels of core deposits, which we expect to
persist for several more quarters.
We're also adjusting our expectations for full-year total revenue growth higher to a range of 3% to 5%. We expect
net interest income growth to be in the mid-single digits while noninterest income is expected to be modestly
lower for the full year. Full year growth expectations for noninterest expense are now between 7% and 9%.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding $21 million of significant items I discussed previously, we expect noninterest
expense to increase between 6% and 8%. This increase relative to our prior expectations is driven by the
foundation donation in the first quarter and increases in compensation expenses related to the higher revenue
expectation for the year. The large majority of the underlying expense growth continues to be driven by
investments in our strategic growth initiatives as we've discussed previously.
While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment to positive
operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation and plan is to bring the expense growth rate back

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
to more normalized levels during the second half of 2021. Finally, credit remains fundamentally sound. We now
expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be between 30 to 40 basis points, reflecting improving economic
conditions and stable charge-offs in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Further reserve releases remain
dependent on the economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are
standalone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the pending acquisition of TCF.

Why don't we start in – just in terms of the interest rate caps, I probably may not be the only one who didn't
appreciate how meaningful this could be on a mark-to-market basis for NII. I get that you added the short cap
position, but it still seems that you are – you have a fair amount of long exposure outstanding. Can you just talk
about the volatility that we should expect – sort of on a – how long did this volatility last over time? I mean, is it
right to assume that we could be looking at maybe not a $100 million-plus swings but $50 million, $60 million
swings in NII in any given quarter, up or down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Ken. This is Zach. I'll take that question. And I would start by saying the priority of our – the goal for this
position and our strategy here was to look around the corner to manage risk to protect capital and to be dynamic
and proactive to do that. And we thought it was a really smart move and as you saw it I think it benefited us
substantially.

And so, that also underlies our decision to continue to maintain this position albeit somewhat collared as we
discussed for the foreseeable future. And so, we'll have to see what happens these get mark-to-market every day
and ultimately we post the result that's extant at the very last day of the quarter. But we believe it's the right
position as we go forward here. So, we'll have to see. We'll keep you posted, but over the long term, we think it's
the – a really smart position for us to protect our capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, I'd just add when we executed these in the fourth quarter, remember, the outlook was that rates would be flat
through – well into 2023. So, we thought the benefit of this capital protection would be in the out years, four, five,
six months and obviously interest rate outlook changed very rapidly after the election. But it wasn't our intent to
sort of view this as some kind of short-term position when we originated it. It was this protection of capital over
time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. No, it definitely worked out incredibly well this quarter. No doubt about that. My second sort of related
follow-up question is a little more in the [indiscernible] (00:21:25) Zach there. I think I'm missing something but
would love your clarification on this. If we look at just the change in net interest income from last quarter to this
quarter and we back out only the change if – the way I understand it, the change in the caps of call it $140 million
to the positive, and then we back out another $40 million change in PPP income, it implies that net interest
income actually went down by $32 million, sort of on and all else equal basis. Am I missing something in that
calculation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No, I think you've got it right. I think we saw as we noted in the commentary a bit of pressure on underlying loans
in the quarter, just from headwinds we're seeing in line utilization. But that was offset by really strong fee income
growth during the quarter. The NIM if you were to strip out that, cap gained was 2.97% to give you a sense of the
net interest margin.

Matthew D. O’Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I know you've talked about it in the past, here and there. But as we think about the increased investment spend
this year, specifically on technology and digital, I just wondered if you could summarize what are couple of the
kind of bigger initiatives, bigger spend is that's driving that higher investment spend this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think – this is Zach. I'll take that and Steve may want to tack on as well here. But, look, what we really like
about our strategic plan is it's incredibly focused, and it's driven by key initiatives across each of our business
lines. So, within our consumer business line, which we've talked about for a while, much of the increased
investment is around digital, with three major focus areas as we've talked about over the last several years and
certain last year improving our digital point of sale and product origination capabilities, we largely completed that
last year. And now the teams are working through how to best optimize and incorporate that within the omni-
channel client engagement process we have for client origination, also a lot of focus around engagement and
deepening to personalization and ease of use client account servicing.
In the commercial business, significant amount of digital investment as well around new client onboarding,
relationship manager digital tool sets as well as focused investment in new people, for example in specialty
banking and in our capital markets business. We're also really pleased with the investments we're putting into our
wealth and investment management business, which again is sort of mixture of both technology to improve the
client-advisor interaction experience and relationship management tools as well as select people hires as we
bring on new relationship managers which is, as I mentioned in my script, really driving substantial sales growth
and performance.
And lastly, I would highlight vehicle finance. For the last several years, we've been working to digitize the
customer experience as well as continue to expand the geographic footprint of that business in a way that's really
constructive. I don't know, Steve, if you want to tack on to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew D. O’Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's a very helpful summary. As we think past the cost saves associated with the TCF deal, you've mentioned
long-term expense growth, like what is a good, call it, three- to five-year outlook on expense growth? And I
understand that might be somewhat revenue-dependent. But if you think about most revenue growth coming from
loans, NIM expansion hopefully, things that aren't super high on the efficiency ratio, what would a good range for
underlying expense growth be?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a great question. And I would note that for the next several years based on our forecast for the
integration of the TCF acquisition, overall reported revenue and expense growth levels will be substantially
impacted by [indiscernible] (00:25:49) quite high levels of growth in both as we incorporate that business and
measure the year-over-year growth.
But on the underlying basis, which I know was the basis of your question, my expectation and goal is that we're
growing the top line at or above nominal GDP with revenue lower than that and driving positive operating
leverage. I think over the long term, something like 1.5% to 3.5% sort of inflationary growth is logical and if
revenue is stronger then perhaps expenses are stronger than that, but generally, that's my broad expectation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken (sic) [Matt], just want to reiterate the commitment to positive operating leverage after nine years, we would let
this year to make investments coming off the strategic plan and in particular because of the economic volatility
that we saw last year with the virus and the expected recovery. We think we are playing this in terms of timing
exactly right. We've got a series of near-term revenue growth initiatives that we're executing and that will position
us for the long term, but we will be back to positive operating leverage.

Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the expense side, so clearly, you have the access revenues
helped by the swaps and then a higher expected growth rate this year on the expenses, which makes sense that
you're continuing to accelerate. But just, Zach, you mentioned last quarter a different cadence between first half
expense growth and second half expense growth. I just want to try to understand is the increment that's
embedded in the new expense growth rate also going to show all in the first half in part due to the items in the
first. Just kind of if you can walk us through how things project from here would be helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, thanks for the question. I appreciate the chance to clarify. Yeah, I would say approximately three-
quarters of the incremental expenses were what we saw come through in Q1. So, there's a small lift in the
balance of the year. But most of it was what we saw come through in Q4 and Q1. And the key thing with our plan
is that as we're front-loading these investments into the first half of the 2021, and so the expectation is really the
10

same as it was before, elevated expense growth on a kind of core run rate basis in the first half coming down to
more normal levels in the second half of the year. And of that 6% to 8% underlying core expense, approximately 5
percentage points of that is our long-term strategic investments. And the other 1% to 3% is really sort of a natural
expense inflation that you might expect and some normalization of company-wide programs like [ph] Merit
(00:28:44) and T&E and medical costs and things of this nature and some additional expenses to support the
additional revenue, as I noted in my prepared remarks. So, front end-loaded, back end back to historical levels
and really no change other than those factors that we just talked about.

Helpful. And then the same kind of – just a thought process on the NII side, obviously NII outlook helped by the
$144 million. Just underneath that, can you just talk about just the underlying changes to your prior views on how
NII versus the fees look as well? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. Overall expect mid-single digits in net interest income for the full year, I think driven by in part by our
modest growth in assets that we've indicated in the guidance between 1% and 3% and the spread – NIM spread
overall that'll be roughly flat for the full year. I think just touching on NIM for a second, next couple of quarters will
likely be in the mid-2.80s in terms of NIM, biggest impact just changing our expectations somewhat is continued
elevated levels of Fed cash driven by the elevated levels of liquidity across the system that many folks have
commented on here in the earnings cycle and to some degree the beginning of the roll-off of our hedges which
will be down about 7 basis points into Q2. So, Q2 will be the trough to mid-2.80s for the next several quarters, but
pulling up FY 2020 still looks like a NIM of 2.90% or better and long term still forecasting to maintain those levels
and stable to rising NIM over the longer term.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the rate caps. So, between the – what you sort of capped in the first
quarter then the sale of the $3 billion of new caps in March, so does this do anything to your sort of your forward
rate sensitivity. I think, Zach, I've sort of thought about the hedges as more balance sheet protection than really
adjusting your rate sensitivity. So, is there any change to that dynamic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, I think you got it right. The position was around protecting capital. And I think you saw on the slide 52% offset
of the OCI mark on securities was protected by this, so it's really good.
We've got our Treasurer, Derek Meyer in the room. Why don't, Derek, you comment a little bit on asset sensitivity
and your outlook for that over the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Executive Vice President & Corporate Treasurer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. So, we've continued to look at that. Obviously, we already stated this was primary thinking of a
capital play. There is a knock-on effect because it comes to earnings on our margin. Most of our decisions have
been to retain as much downside protection or capturing the upside. As these rates have gone up and that is
these caps have obviously made us even more sensitive in that respect, we are evaluating our next hedging
moves to protect that downside, without giving up that upside opportunity. So, it does change the posture. That's
also a big part of what we're thinking about as we evaluate our positioning with TCF, which is a separate set of
decisions. But that is another set of levers that we have to incorporate into our forward view.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Broadly speaking, just pulling back a second, I really like where the asset sensitivity kind of strategy and trend is
going in that over time as our existing hedge position slowly rolls off, we will become more and more exposed to
what will be likely a gradually increasing interest rate environment as well. And so, I think it's sort of well-timed for
us to be exposed in that way as rates begin to rise over the next several years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess as a follow-up, I think Zach at a point you'd mentioned the sale
of the new rate caps, the $3 billion, that should sort of dampen the new mark-to-market impacts. Is there a way to
sort of speak to how much protection you have against future volatility like we saw this quarter both up and down?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a good question. We estimate it's between 15% and 30% impact on dampening. So important, we
wanted to maintain kind of a net long exposure there because we do think to the extent that there is a probability
of moves substantially off the forward curve which is likely to be higher but that dampening is between 15% and
30% as we go forward.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I was wondering if – could you talk about – you mentioned the loan pipelines are very strong. I'm just wondering
can you talk about what you're hearing from your customers about making investments and – versus kind of the
appetite to draw down on lines of credit versus using that excess liquidity and maybe delaying line drawdowns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Peter, this is Steve. So in the last four or five weeks, I've had about 50 CEOs in small meeting virtual
conversations. And the outlook by them is virtually in all very positive about this year pipelines, their backlogs,
very, very encouraging and their overall economic outlook for the next couple of years is also very positive. They
have – in a number of situations, have supply chain constraints, some of it from mundane items, some of it for
chips. But there's a curtailment that I think is being experienced at least in part by these companies on the supply
chain.
Universally, they talk about inability to get adequate labor, very high turnover, and clear wage inflation at the low-
end. A consequence of that will be more investment by many of them into automation all the way through
including packaging. So, we expect there'll be a fair amount of equipment finance activity this year and when be
combine with TCF, we'll have a [indiscernible] (00:35:42) largest equipment finance company in the country that
13

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
should position us very well. We have a very good technology finance team that will play well with automation on
the factory side. But even in the healthcare, healthcare products side, we're seeing a strong uptick. Healthcare
systems are doing better and been able to reopen and sustain activity that was diminished during the peak of the
virus.
So, we – the people we're talking to, the CEOs in that arena, generally very, very confident going forward. So, we
think the strong pipelines we're seeing, we're up about 40% of the commercial pipeline year-over-year is reflective
of what will be demand as we go through the year, probably more in the second half than first. But this will be in
part because many of them had very good years, have liquidity and they're using that liquidity as opposed to
outlying utilizations and other things. Inventories are low in many of these companies. And some of it's supply
chain, but some of it's in significant demand. Inflation on the commodity side, wood or lumber, just a whole host of
areas where there's cost push. And I think that will in general further borrowing as their liquidity gets soaked up.
So, we're – from these conversations, we're optimistic about the continuing improvement especially seen in the
second half.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then, if I can ask just a follow-up on the PPP. You gave some pretty good disclosure
on slide 11. But what's the outlook, Zach, for the rest of the year to net interest income from PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think as we said, the expectation is that we'll see a very substantial amount of additional forgiveness in the
second quarter. And I think to give you a sense, Q1 revenue in total from PPP was around $76 million, of which
$45 million was the kind of accelerated and $31 million was the underlying yield. My expectation for Q2 is around
$50 million total revenue, of which $20 million – basically, half and half between yield and accelerating – the
acceleration. And that will represent the preponderance of the PPP revenues for the first program. We'll see a
little bit of a tail as we go into the balance of the year.
The round two I mentioned is around $2 billion. About 85%, we think we've forgiven much of it in 2021. That'll add
around $1.3 billion of [indiscernible] (00:38:45) and $60 million of revenue we estimate to the year. I know we
have – we'll have an analyst modeling call after this and we'll probably double-click into more of the details during
that, but those were the right high-level comments for you now.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Zach. Some investors have expressed concern around the risk that internal
combustion engine vehicles will lose value compared to electronic vehicles as they take over and obviously
there's debate around when that's going to happen. But can you speak to how HBAN is thinking about this risk,
what you guys are doing about it and the extent to which you expect to play a role in helping consumers fund Q3
EV purchases, as well as like from the standpoint of risk of declining collateral values for your existing book, if you
could comment on that as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, Bill, it's Steve, a good question. Thank you. We think it's going to be an extended transition here. I believe the
industry is of that belief as well because EV is building in the country, but it's building at a very slow rate. Now,
that may accelerate with climate posture of the Biden Administration and for other reasons, including consumer
awareness around environmental and change in demand. But combustion engines we think are going to be here
through the decade in terms of demand and substantially there if not fully through production.
Having said that, in terms of the impact on us, we're a super-prime lender. So, whether it's a combustion engine
or a hybrid or EV, we work with a view of very low default rates. And so, marginal loss rates might increase a bit
and probably would anyway because we're at record highs in terms of global values for use. So – but we don't
see it as a big event. In terms of opportunity for us, it's one of the areas of environmentally sensitive financing that
we're looking at. There're a series of other areas where we're actively engaged and extending credit in the – over
time as we look back in the billions of dollars and there may be an opportunity for us to do something unique with
the hybrids or EVs as we go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, Steve, can you give a bit more color on some of the things you're doing
ahead of the TCF closing just to make sure you hit the ground running next year. Is most of the initial focus on
ensuring smooth integration versus maybe is it just too early to be thinking about the revenue synergy opportunity
that is down the road or is that in the mix as well? Any color around that would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, when we announced, we talked about expense synergies and we're fairly definitive. But we also alluded to
revenue synergies. To start with, our offerings both consumer and business are much more extensive than TCF.
So, it sets up a cross-sell, something we've been working on. And we refer to it as optimal customer relationships.
So, we've been doing this for a decade. We have very good experience with cross-sell into the FirstMerit
customer base, and we expect it to do as good or even better based on the learnings and experiences and the
relative position.
TCF also outsourced a number of businesses or products, which we manage directly. And so, we'll expect lift out
of those. So, there's a variety of revenue initiatives which we are pursuing and, in some cases, we've already
activated such as SBA lending in Minneapolis, an activity that TCF didn't have. And so, as we go forward, we'll
expect these revenue initiatives – and we'll share them in a future point – will be significant upside to what we've
presented in a summary level. So, we'll detail where we expect to get them as we proceed. But first order of
15

business is to execute the committed expense takeout and to get the synergies on that front that we expected
with the closing expected later this quarter and a conversion late in the third quarter.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steve Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please
proceed with your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. This is Janet Lee on for Steve Alexopoulos. Just digging deeper into your commercial loan growth
guidance, I understand that in your guidance of commercial loans being flat to modestly higher for 2021, what is
your assumption around the level of commercial utilization for your C&I customers as compared to the current
level? And could you also provide more color around like how that compares to pre-pandemic levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Janet, for the questions. This is Zach. I'll take it. Overall, as I mentioned in the comments, the
expectation is, excluding PPP, low-single-digit growth in commercial loans and approximately 1.5 percentage of
that is from some modest line utilization. Overall, the expectation for line utilization is it has been reset. And I'll
come back in a minute and speak more specifically about the pre-pandemic comparisons you asked. But just
generally, characterizing the expectation, what we've seen is relatively flat in general middle-market lines.
My baseline expectation is a modest improvement. Likewise, what we've seen on the vehicle floor plan side is
actually some retrenchment from the end of last year to where we stand now. As we go forward, we're expecting
some modest improvement in both of those. Together, those represent just under 1% asset growth expectation
with my total asset growth. But even if you were to normalize it, I think the level of strong production we've got
across both consumer and commercial, we do expect to drive accelerated loan growth overall in that basis as we
go forward.
Just double-clicking into the line utilization expectations, pre-pandemic, we were running in the middle-market line
utilizations sort of low-40% and right now we're in the high-30% to give you a sense. It's been roughly flat now for
several months in a row, and I would expect it will be flat for a time before it starts to rise later in the year.
I think, as has been well-publicized, elevated levels of liquidity across the system are contributing to our clients
just not meeting those lines at this point. But everything we're hearing from them is that ultimately they expect to
16


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
go back to a more typical financing posture that those will start to slowly normalize probably more in the back half
late 2021 and continuing into 2022.
On the vehicle floor plan side, the historical levels are sort of just around 80% line utilization. By the end of the
year, we had gotten to almost 61% to be precise in December; by the end of this quarter, order of 51% to give you
a sense. So, it just continues to tick down and it's ticked down even a little bit more into April. So, we'll have to
see. That one is really driven by the point-specific auto manufacturer issues that have been very well-documented
in the popular press around microchip shortages and other component shortages. Everything we're hearing
though is that slowly but surely that they are chipping away at that issue, the manufacturers, and that vehicles will
begin to flow at a faster rate in the back half of the year.
My general expectations are relatively flat in that for the next several months before it starts to normalize and rise
more again towards the very late part of 2021 with the longer-term expectation, based on our client discussions,
that they'll go back to historical levels of utilizing that financing, but probably well into the middle of 2022 based on
the supply.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. And just turning to – I want to talk through the new money yields. At what yields
new purchase securities are being put out to the book versus what's rolling off, and same for new loan
production? And also what's your plan around deploying excess cash and how much of that could be deployed
into securities over the next several quarters? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I'll take the first crack at this, and then Derek Meyer, our Treasurer, is in the room as well, and may tack-on
as we go. On the securities side, we feel really good actually about where the yields are and what we were able to
deploy with the roughly $2 billion of net add during the quarter, came on sort of around the 160-basis-point level
as we think about other new money yields, generally some modest pressure but not overly so. I think in the
commercial business, around 0.25 point lower as we went into Q1 from Q4, CRE likewise around 30 to 35 basis
points lower, auto roughly stable. So, we're seeing some modest downdrafts on new money, but not overly
material, I would say at this point, most of the program impacts have been brought into the pricing.
As we take a step back and think about the posture on elevated liquidity, I would say that as we've continued to
update our forecast, we've ratcheted it higher the expectation for elevated levels of liquidity and deposits as is
indicated by our deposit guidance and likewise ratcheted out in time the duration that this phenomenon will last
until it begins to normalize. So, likely it'll take several more quarters for that to slowly start to weigh in and it'll go
all the way into 2022. So, that gives us the cause to really look at the best ways to deploy that.
Over time, you've seen us optimize our funding structure and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that to
bring down funding costs using that. But I think as well looking at whether it's appropriate over time to invest in
incremental securities is also part of the discussion. To be clear, liquidity is the primary objective in making sure
that we're managing that well. And so, we'll leg into and step into kind of phased basis any incremental moves on
that and still working through it, nothing for us specifically to talk about there, but we'll continue to be dynamic in
looking at it and just watching those trends and optimizing.
Anything, Derek, you would tack-on to what I said?

Derek Meyer A
Executive Vice President & Corporate Treasurer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No, I think you've covered it. We have reached the point with our VA yield security strategy where the new money
yields sort of equals to our run-off yields, plus or minus 0.5%. So, a lot of what's going to happen with prepayment
speeds and then with the yield curve shape is, I don't see a big change in trajectory.

Most of it's been handled, but can you – Steve, can you talk a little bit about retention and synergies that you saw
on a FirstMerit and also touch on like you gave the 44 branches that you're closing, what kind of retention you get
from those, and how you're thinking about TCF in terms of retention as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We have a set of opportunities. Thanks, Jon. Good morning. I'm sorry. We have a set of opportunities with TCF
that are substantial in terms of retaining customers. If we think about Michigan for example, even after our
consolidations of branches and in aggregate there'll be more than 200 branches affected by consolidation and
divestiture. We will still have number one branch share in Michigan by a factor of about 50%. So, we'll be quite a
bit larger than the next bank with physical distribution. So, that provides an enormous set of opportunities for us in
terms of retention. And we have had very high retention coming out of FirstMerit and other in-store branch
consolidations.
18


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Remember, we consolidate about 4% of franchise every year on average. And so, our retention efforts where we
decide to drop remaining ATMs outreach, we have a process we call white glove treatment that's been well-
defined over the years and developed. Combination of those activities, the uniqueness of the product set while
they deposited 24-hour grade safety zone, things like that also give us a distinct retention advantage.
So, we expect to have very high retention by the TCF side of the consumer. And on the business side, again,
better products, more capabilities as we go forward. But it starts with winning minds and hearts of our soon to be
new colleagues and we're actively working that. We would expect that would be successful as it was with
FirstMerit. That will set up then this retention of customers through the conversion and beyond and the product
menu just being substantially different, much, much bigger and better in many respects will be to the benefit of the
customer base both consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses.
So, we're very, very optimistic on the specialty finance side. Their equipment finance and ours is almost hand in
glove. But the combination will be extraordinarily effective and they have a great team. We think we do as well
and this hand in glove will give us opportunities to further grow that business. We're excited about their inventory
finance business. Got some great people in these business lines as well as in the company generally and we're
going to be a stronger company as a consequence of the combination. So, very bullish about the expectations
both on retention and revenue synergies as we go forward and we'll get the expense synergies largely complete
this year.

Jon G. Arfstrom Q

Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Zach, can you touch on mortgage expectations for the second quarter? I
know it's kind of a mixed bag, but looks like originations were pretty flat. What kind of thoughts do you have for the
next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We have Q2 right in front of us. It's just broadly still thinking mortgage, just continue to beat expectations
frankly and be very robust. I think the – overall, for the full year, expecting revenues to be down between 15% and
20% on a year-over-year basis just off of the total pace that 2020 represented. But most of that growth or
challenge really occurs in the second half of the year. Volumes continue to be very, very robust. And I think if you
just talk in industry level, you've probably seen even mortgage bankers, associations rationing higher to volume
expectations for the year. I think if there's something that we're watching carefully is the salable spread and that
continues to be elevated above historical levels, but it could move quickly, so we'll see. But so far, continues to be
holding up relatively well also. So, that's the expectations that we've got.

Thank you for your questions and interest in Huntington. I'm pleased with our strong start to what will be an

acquisition. I'm increasingly optimistic about the opportunities we see in 2021 and beyond and I'm confident of our
ability to capitalize on the accelerating economic recovery.
The disciplined execution of our strategies coupled with the pending acquisition set us up to grow revenue from a
larger customer base from which we will deepen existing and acquired customer relationships resulting in top
quartile financial performance. We've a strong foundation of enterprise risk management and deeply embedded
stock ownership mentality, which aligns our board management and colleagues.
Again, thank you for your support and interest. Have a great day.
