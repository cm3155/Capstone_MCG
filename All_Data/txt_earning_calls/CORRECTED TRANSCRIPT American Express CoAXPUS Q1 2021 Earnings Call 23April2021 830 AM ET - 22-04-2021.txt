Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. Early this morning, we reported
first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say that our overall core
business performance was slightly better than our expectations, with credit performance continuing to be best-in-
class, and we're especially encouraged about the progress we're making toward our aspiration of returning to the
original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022. As I discussed in January, we're looking at 2021 as a
transition year, where our focus is on investing to rebuild growth momentum, but firing up our core business,
scaling next horizon opportunities, while continuing to retain financial flexibility. And while I feel good about our
results for the quarter, what I feel really good about is the progress we're making to rebuild momentum.
When we talk about firing up core, we're looking for meaningful progress in four areas. Spending volumes coming
back to pre-pandemic levels, bringing new customers into the franchise, retaining and deepening relationships
with our current customers, and signing up additional merchants. We're making good progress in all these areas.
Overall spending on American Express cards in Q1 continued the sequential improvements we saw through the
last two quarters of 2020. US volumes exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and spending in March from US
consumer and small and medium size enterprise customers was higher than March 2019 levels. Non-US volume
lagged a bit due to renewed lockdowns in certain international countries.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Excluding travel and entertainment categories, spending on our cards in Q1 was up 11% on an FX-adjusted basis
versus 2019 levels. This marked a third straight quarter of positive growth. And although the T&E volumes were
significantly lower in the first quarter versus last year, we've seen a steady sequential upward trend in monthly
T&E spending and a noticeable improvement in recent weeks, particularly in the US as the vaccine rollout
accelerated.
These trends indicate that the pent-up demand for consumer travel we've been talking about is real and it
increases our confidence that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover as the year progresses. In terms
of bringing new customers into the franchise, card acquisitions are also gaining momentum and we're up
sequentially in the quarter globally. In fact, new accounts acquired on key premium US consumer and small
business products were above 2019 levels and exceeded the prior quarters. Initial spending on these new cards
is strong and the average FICO scores of these new US consumer and small business Card Members are higher
than those acquired pre-pandemic.
In addition, card acquisitions in some of our largest travel co-brand portfolios have accelerated since the fourth
quarter, an important indicator that travel remains an attractive category for consumers over the long-term.
Another indicator of building momentum in our core business is retaining and increasing engagement with existing
Card Members. We have a good story to tell here as well.
Card Member attrition on our proprietary products which also includes our co-brands continues to be lower than in
the previous years, and customer satisfaction levels remain higher than pre-COVID levels. The additional value
we provided on several of our premium products helped drive Card Member loyalty and spending in 2020, and as
we believed, has been sustained into this year.
For example, 95% of US Platinum Card Members who took advantage of the streaming credits, and 88% who
used wireless credits offered last year, are continuing to spend in these categories months later. We're also
seeing good engagement on the new offers we rolled out earlier in the first quarter for Platinum Card members
which includes statement credits with PayPal and other select merchants.
The uptake on these offers are in-line with the wireless and streaming offers we announced last year. Overall,
Card Member engagement with our digital channels and capabilities is at an all-time high in most areas. For
example, over 88% of our US Card Members are making their payments digitally and 87% use our website or app
for self-service. The number of Amex offers redeemed in Q1 increased five-fold versus last year's first quarter,
topping 5.3 million redemptions. Finally, we continue to see strong adoption of Pay It Plan It, our buy now pay
later feature, after we recently expanded the capability to all US consumer cards. Since launching Pay It Plan It,
Card Members have created over 6 million plans totaling over $5 billion of accounts receivable.
Another key driver in momentum is expanding merchant coverage. In the first quarter, we continued to make
progress growing merchant coverage internationally while maintaining our coverage levels in the US. When it
comes to building momentum, we aren't just focused on the near term, we're also focused on scaling next horizon
opportunities that will drive growth over the longer term. China represents an exciting opportunity in this regard.
As you know, developing our card processing network in Mainland China has been a priority for us and we're
pleased with our progress. Since getting the green light to start processing payments in China eight months ago,
we have reached mobile wallet parity coverage through our partnerships with Chinese major mobile wallet
providers, and to-date, we have added over 14 million merchants to the network at the point-of-sale, with more to
come.

A key enabler of our coverage growth in China is the progress we're making to modernize our network,
particularly in adding the capability to process debit transactions globally, which is an essential need for
customers in China and helps us prepare for potential additional debit applications elsewhere. We remain focused
on scaling our China business by acquiring Card Members through the relationships we've established with 16
issuing partners, and I look forward to sharing more highlights of our progress over the course of the year.
In our Commercial business, our growth has been and will continue to be driven primarily by small and medium
size enterprises. A key element of our longer-term growth strategy for SME franchise is to deepen our
relationships with current customers and attract new ones by offering a range of supplier payment and cash flow
management solutions, both on and beyond the card, giving business owners more tools to help them manage
their businesses. Kabbage is one example of how we plan to bring this strategy to life. We've been focused on
integrating Kabbage's digital capabilities into our business, and in Q1, we began the rollout of the Kabbage
platform, which includes a business checking account and working capital solutions to our small business
customers.
In our Consumer business, Resy, our online dining platform, helps drive bookings and spending at restaurants,
which is a top category for our Card Members. When the pandemic hit, Resy quickly pivoted its value proposition
for restaurant owners to help them expand their offerings and find new ways to attract customers, including
enabling takeout, meal kits, family meals and virtual events. Resy also provided a number of special offers for
Amex Card Members. As a result, over the past year, Resy has seen significant growth in engagement for both
consumers and restaurants. In fact, we've seen a number of reservations booked on the platform more than
double since December, and Amex Card Members who use Resy are some of our highest spending and most
profitable customers.
Those are just some of the examples of our progress in rebuilding our growth momentum, both in our core
business and with next horizon opportunities. Importantly, as we've increased our investments in both categories,
we've also been focused on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We resumed share repurchases this
quarter, and our capital ratios continue to be well above our targets.
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to share some thoughts on where I see things heading in the near term.
As I sit here a little over a year since the global COVID pandemic started, I'm optimistic that the hopeful signs
we're seeing as vaccine distribution accelerates will continue and get stronger as we move through the year. Of
course we're still cautiously keeping an eye on the progression of the virus and its impact on local lockdowns and
cross border travel restrictions in certain areas, but there are clear indicators that the economy is improving,
particularly in the US, and I believe this will translate into continued steady improvements for American Express.
Given all of this, we remain firmly committed to executing on our 2020 investment strategy for rebuilding growth
momentum for the longer term. As I said last quarter, we're not focused on achieving a particular EPS target this
year. Instead, we're focused on achieving our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for
2020 in 2022 and for the company to be positioned to execute on our financial growth algorithm going forward. I'm
encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2021, which makes me even more confident in our roadmap for
achieving our 2022 aspiration. I'm particularly proud of our colleagues who have remained nimble and focused
through the uncertainties of the past year, their dedication and hard work along with the flexibility of our business
model, the loyalty of our customer base, the strength of our partnerships and the value of our brand make me feel
very good about the future.
Jeff will now walk you through our results, and we will take questions after that.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results,
which reflect good progress towards the aspirations we have for 2022 that Steve just outlined. As I've said since
the beginning of the pandemic last year, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain
volume and credit trends along with, this year, the marketing investments we are making to rebuild growth
momentum. I'll spend most of my time this morning on these topics.
But first, looking at the summary of financials on slide 3, when you consider year-over-year results, last year's first
quarter included two months of pre-pandemic results. And so as you would expect, first quarter revenues of $9.1
billion were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. But in contrast, while we don't typically look at
monthly results, were you to look at our revenues in just the month of March, you'd see that they were up 7%
year-over-year. Our first quarter net income was $2.2 billion, and earnings per share was $2.74. Included in these
results is a $1.05 billion credit reserve release due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and continued
strong credit performance.
So now, let's get into the first key driver of our performance, volumes, beginning with a few comments on some
nomenclature changes we have made to our volume reporting. Thinking ahead on how we expect our card
processing network in Mainland China to grow in the coming quarters and years, we have renamed what we
previously called G&S billed business as processed volumes because our business model in China is unique and
different from what we do at our G&S partners in other regions. We have also changed what we previously
referred to as proprietary billed business to just billed business and renamed what we used to call our overall
volumes from billed business to network volumes. You will see we've recast prior periods in the disclosures that
accompany our earnings release as well as on appendix, slide 27.
So, with these changes in mind, moving on to our volume performance on slide 4, we saw continued recovery
across all of our volumes in the first quarter, with total network and billed business volumes down 8% and 9%,
respectively and processed volumes down only 1%, all on an FX-adjusted basis.
Getting into the details of our billed business growth, which you will see several views of on slides 5 through 10,
we've shown first quarter trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 in order to provide a clearer
picture of how spending is recovering as we begin to lap the onset of the pandemic in March of last year. I also
note that the trends we've seen in the first two weeks of April are a continuation of the trends we saw exiting the
first quarter that I'll focus on this morning. In addition, it remains important to look at spending on travel and
entertainment categories separately from spending in other categories, which we will now be calling goods and
services spending, given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these two very different categories.
Overall, there are a few key points I'd suggest as the takeaways on volumes from all of these slides. First, there
are clear signs of volume momentum that we feel good about. As you can see on slide 5, our overall billed
business volume growth continued to recover steadily throughout the months of the first quarter, with the
reopening of the economy and rollout of the vaccines progressing well in the US and certain other geographies.
Spending on goods and services, which represents the vast majority, or 86% of our volumes, exceeded our
expectations, growing 6% year-over-year and up 11% versus 2019 in the quarter, and up 15% in the month of
March. Spending on travel and entertainment also showed sequential improvement, given the progress on the
medical front in the US, further reinforcing our view that consumer and small business travel will recover over
time.

Second, the growth in goods and services spending has continued to improve steadily in both our Consumer and
Commercial businesses. In Consumer, as shown on slide 6, we continue to see strong online and card not
present spend growth, which was up 23% year-over-year this quarter, even as the recovery of offline spending
accelerated, driving goods and services volumes up 7% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. In Commercial, as
you can see on slide 7, SME spending remains the most resilient across our customer types, supported by
continued growth in B2B spending, which drove overall commercial spend on goods and services up 5% year-
over-year and up 8% versus 2019 in the first quarter.
Third, we are seeing a faster pace of spending recovery in the US versus other regions. As shown on slide 8, the
total volumes from our US consumer and SME customers are recovering faster than other customer types and
were up 1% versus 2019 levels in the month of March, even with the continued drag of T&E spend not yet fully
recovering. International consumer and SME spending, on the other hand, is recovering more slowly due to
renewed restrictions in key international geographies and the fact that historically, we tend to have more travel-
related spending in our international regions. And large and global corporate card spending, which historically has
been primarily travel and entertainment, continued to be down the most during the first quarter, as we expected,
since this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.
Fourth, T&E spending, though still down significantly, did improve steadily across all categories throughout the
months of the first quarter, and consumer T&E continued to recover faster than that of SMEs and large
corporations, as you can see on slides 9 and 10. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent-up demand to
travel that we see in our consumer base and the positive early signs of domestic travel recovery that we see in
the US as the vaccine rollout progresses.
So to sum up on spending volumes, we feel good about the steady growth we are seeing in goods and services
spending, and we expect it to continue to grow throughout 2021. On T&E spending, the trends we've seen in the
first quarter are encouraging and give us more confidence in our current assumption that by Q4, T&E spending
will have recovered to around 70% of its Q4 2019 levels, led by recovery in US consumer domestic travel.
Turning next to the other key volume driver, receivable and loan balances, on slide 11, receivable balances were
down 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with spending volumes. Loan balances,
however, were down 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, more than spending volumes, as we continued to
see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base, leading to higher paydown rates, which relates to the
very strong credit performance I'll talk about in just a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in
loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes.
So, turning next to our second key driver, credit and provision, on slides 12 through 16. As you flip through these
slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. We continue to see extremely strong credit
performance, with Card Member loans and receivables write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 53% and 82%
year-over-year, respectively, as you can see on slide 12. We attribute this performance to our robust risk
management practices, the premium nature of our customer base, as well as the unprecedented level of
government stimulus and forbearance programs.
Clearly, macroeconomic forecasts have improved over the last 90 days, as you can see on slide 13. However, we
still have two very different macroeconomic forecast scenarios, and we continued to put significant weight on the
downside scenario in the modeling we did to calculate our first quarter credit reserves. The impact of the
improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models, coupled with the sequential
decline in loan and receivables balances and our strong credit performance, led us to release $1.05 billion of
7

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
reserves. This reserve release and our extremely low write-offs drove a provision expense benefit of $675 million
in the first quarter, as shown on slide 14.
That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $2.1 billion higher than they were pre-
pandemic, as you can see on slide 15. In the coming quarters, we will see how the Card Members exiting our
financial relief programs will perform. That will be an important milestone for us, though I would observe that all of
the early exit performance indicators have looked quite strong. There also continues to be some uncertainty in the
medical environment and the vaccine rollout, and we'll have to see how that plays out. And so we continue to hold
a significant amount of reserves. Slide 16 shows you this in that we ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of
reserves, representing 6.4% of our loan balances and 0.5% of our Card Member receivable balances,
respectively.
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to rebuild growth momentum on slide 17. We invested $1
billion in marketing in the first quarter as we continued to ramp-up new card acquisitions while maintaining our
value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.1 million new cards in the first quarter, up around 20% sequentially.
Importantly, the number of new accounts we acquired on our premium fee-based products was up 35% versus
Q4, with acquisition volumes on many of our premium US consumer and small business products exceeding 2019
levels. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our
investments to do so. As a result, we continue to expect to spend a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this full
year. Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment
opportunities and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts, as our customers begin again to
experience the full benefits of our existing value propositions.
So, what do our three key drivers mean for our financial performance this quarter? As I said earlier, year-over-
year revenues on slides 18 and 19 are impacted by the prior-year quarter including two pre-pandemic months. So
first quarter revenues were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily driven by volume
declines impacting net discount revenue and net interest income, as well as declines in travel-related revenues
and delinquencies impacting other commissions and fees and other revenues. Net card fees, however, grew 10%
year-over-year in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 20, demonstrating the impact of the strong continued
Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. Looking forward, I expect the growth rate of net card fees will
slow for a few more quarters, driven by our decision last year to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were
managing through the peak of uncertainty during the beginning of the pandemic. Given the renewed momentum
we are now beginning to see in new card acquisitions, I would expect net card fee growth to then reaccelerate.
Moving on to net interest income on slide 21, you see that net interest income declined 22% year-over-year on an
FX-adjusted basis. While the primary driver of this is the decline in loan volumes. Net interest yield on our Card
Member loans also decreased 60 basis points due to the higher pay-down rates from revolving Card Members on
our credit card products. Looking forward, I expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan
volumes.
Volumes are also the primary driver of the discount revenue trends you see on slide 22. As expected, though, the
contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business. The average
discount rate declined 8 basis points year-over-year driven by the greater declines we saw in T&E spending
where we, on average, earn higher discount rates. The year-over-year erosion in the first quarter is a bit less than
in Q4 due to the recovery in T&E spending throughout the quarter that I spoke about earlier. Looking forward, we
still expect that if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4 as I mentioned previously, you'd
probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or
quickly, you could see full year revenue growth that's somewhat lower or higher than that 9% or 10%.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Moving on to expenses, we are continuing to break out on slide 23 our variable customer engagement expenses,
which moved naturally in-line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven
by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 10% year-over-year.
Relative to the past few quarters, we did experience higher usage of travel-related benefits and rewards, which
we see as a clear sign of the pent-up demand we've been talking about. Looking forward, a good way to think
about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total
revenues for the next few quarters.
Moving on to operating expenses, you can see that they were down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter,
primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio, partially offset by some
higher deferred and other compensation expenses. In 2021, we still expect our operating expenses to be around
$11.5 billion, below 2019 levels as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also
investing to rebuild growth momentum.
Turning next to capital and liquidity on slide 23, our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong. Our
CET1 ratio increased to 14.8% in the first quarter, our highest level since we began reporting this ratio, and our
cash and investment balance ended the quarter at $61.5 billion, far above our target levels, driven by the
shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year. We resumed share repurchases in the first quarter,
repurchasing 3.3 million shares, and we remain committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1
target ratio of 10% to 11%. In Q2, we plan to repurchase shares up to the maximum amount permitted under the
Fed authorized capacity of around $900 million. Looking forward, our capital distributions will be a function of the
Fed's guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet.
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in Q1 might mean for the future. In January, I
laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happens with credit
reserves. Our original Scenario 1 or low scenario, assumed a much worse medical and economic environment
this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the year. Now, three months into the year, the
macro outlook has improved and credit performance has remained very strong, so we've already released $1.05
billion of reserves. This still leaves us, however, with a lot of credit reserves we've built due to economic
uncertainty. So our updated Scenario 1 on slide 25 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical and
economic environment does not improve further and that we therefore do not release any additional credit
reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a
70% T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things
could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $6 per share.
Our updated Scenario 2, in contrast, assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady
improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and having no need to maintain our current level
of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery,
in-line with the 9% to 10% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could
be as high as $7.50. More importantly, in either scenario, as I said earlier, our marketing investment levels will be
governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see not by a focus on any specific EPS
outcome for 2021. What we are focused on is managing the company to rebuild growth momentum and achieving
our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations that we had for 2020 in 2022 and for the company to
be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm beyond 2022.
And with that I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

Hey, Don? Could you start again? We missed the beginning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sure, no problem. So, Jeff, if you look at your T&E down about 54% versus 2019 in March, and April sounds like it
gained a lot of momentum, it looks like down 30% for Q4 would be pretty conservative. How are you thinking
about that? And also, what are your T&E assumptions as you sort of look at your 2022 aspirational guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, maybe I'll start and then, Steve, you might want to add a few comments. So let me work backwards. So, in
2022, we're really assuming, Don, that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it
was pre-pandemic. Small business lagging that a bit, and then large and global corporation travel still being well
below its 2019 levels.
The other comment I would make about 2022 is domestic travel in the US and around the globe will be the fuel
that gets us to that level. We would still expect cross-border travel to be a little weaker next year than it was in
2019, just given the likely lingering number of cross-border restrictions that you've seen.
As of how we feel about our Q4 assumption, look, we had a clear inflection point this quarter in the US, and so we
feel good. But, Steve, you may want to add a few comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. No, I think that the assumptions that Jeff just went through are exactly the assumptions we have in our
calculus here, but I think when you look at this quarter and you look at the trends that we're seeing, I mean, we're
seeing an increase in bookings, right. So we're seeing our travel bookings are up 50% over the – this quarter up
10


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
50% over Q4 2020. When you look at – and we look at this really carefully. When you look at February versus
March, in March now, we were 50% of 2019 bookings, and that was 19%. So we were 31% in February and then
went to 50%. So we feel really good about that.
When we also start to really dig into the data, we start to look at sort of cohorts of spending. And we're seeing
people that are younger are getting back at a much higher level. Their overall T&E spending is probably about
85% to 90%, and almost 100% back to where they were in 2019 in restaurants. And then, when we look at older
people, as they get vaccinated, we're seeing sequential growth month-on-month as we look at their growth. And
so if you look at just people over 45, you're seeing an 11% increase in their overall T&E spending month-to-
month. That's only going to get better for us as we move along.
And the last thing that gives us a lot of great hope is, is redemptions, is MR redemptions. I mean, when you go
back and look at sort of MR redemptions that we had, our MR point redemptions in the fourth quarter for air was
like 30%. And that's up to 54%. So we're doing some good things here and our customers are doing some good
things, and we'll continue to make sure that we're retaining these customers because they're going to spend. And
as Jeff said, our co-brand cards are doing quite well as well.
So all of that leads to, again, in an environment that continues to improve, us having a lot of confidence in hitting
our 2020 plan in 2022.

Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Hope everybody's well. Wanted to just ask about the guide a little bit for 2021. Versus your original scenarios that
you laid out with fourth quarter earnings, how much higher was the reserve release than you had envisioned? I'm
trying to understand how much pull-forward of reserve release benefit might have happened in the first quarter
because of how strong credit quality was and the fact that lending did not accelerate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So I think, Craig, the first comment I would make is, remember, we're not trying to provide guidance this
year. We tried to give people a couple of low and high scenarios back in January to help people think about the
11

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
year, and we updated them this quarter. What we are incredibly focused on is that 2022 aspiration, which we are
really growing in confidence about.
All that said, if I take you back to January, the then $5 low scenario assumed that the world would be so tough
this year that you would not end up releasing any credit reserves. So we just released $1.05 billion of reserves.
That's about $1. That takes you from $5 to $6. So your $6 assumes, once again, the world from here is suddenly
going to get really tough and you're not going to release any more reserves. At the high end, yes, we had
assumed you release some modest level of reserves, which is why the high end only went up from $7 to $7.50.
So that's how we thought about it. I just want to close, though, by again emphasizing we're not focused on any
particular EPS outcome this year. We're incredibly focused on what we're trying to achieve for 2022.

Operator: We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. I think that guidance around the corporate T&E spend makes a lot of sense. But, Steve, I'd be
interested in getting your color on recent conversations you're having with your large corporates on when they
think they'll feel comfortable having their employees travel more freely? Whether they'll recover to pre-pandemic
levels? How much substitution of virtual occurs? And then finally, just given that, do you see more upside or kind
of downside to that 70% recovery level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
All right. So when you think about corporate, the first thing people have to do is get back into the offices, right,
because if people aren't back into the offices, there's nowhere to travel to. And you're starting to see – look, I
mean, Jeff and I are in here today with 80 of our closest friends in a building that has about 5,000 people. And
we've said we're not going to have people really come back until after Labor Day. You're seeing other companies
sort of gradually get back into it. So I think there's step 1. First step is, let's get people back into the office. And
then companies are going to say, okay, how comfortable I am having visitors into the building? And my
anticipation is most companies will start the process of reopening in the United States, now, July through sort of
September and get to some capacity level. And I mean, you guys have your own situations yourselves, where
most of you are probably sitting at home today. So I think what's going to happen is it's going to be slow, which is
why we really haven't assumed a lot of corporate T&E coming back and a lot of travel coming back.
Having said that, corporate T&E takes many forms. We do have salespeople that are out and on the road and
calling on accounts, and there's car rental and there's gas and they're still staying at hotels and restaurants and
so I think for a segment of it. And I think when you look at a segment of our, let's call them, industrial corporate
T&E -corporate customers, they have people that are going to plants and visiting, making customer calls and so
forth.
I think that eventually what'll happen is investment banks and consultants are going to want to go out and meet
with their clients again. There's been a lot of deals that have been done, a lot of relationships that have been built.
But there's nothing like in-person. I just think it'll take a bit of time. And look, there's also that substitution. It's the
substitution of Webex and Zoom and what have you, which is why we've been talking 2023 before it gets back to
2019 levels. And I think with that assumption, we feel good about hitting that 2020 aspiration in 2022. So when
12


American Express Co.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
you think about what goes into our assumption for 2022 you've got a slower return of international, you've got a
much lower return of corporate, and yet, we're saying we'll be at 2020 levels.
And so is there upside from a consumer perspective on travel? I think that all depends on the rollout of the
vaccine, governments opening up their borders and things like that. I think from a domestic travel perspective,
there's pent-up demand. In talking to Ed Bastian, in talking to Chris Nassetta, they're seeing a lot of bookings out
front. I just went through some of our travel data. So as we go through this, I think what's going to be the key thing
to watch for is how much does international travel come back from a consumer? And we're assuming that sort of
now in the second half of 2022. Okay? Not really this year.
And I think the other thing you're seeing, Mark, is you're seeing a divergence. I mean you see what's going on in
India right now. There's a lot of countries that are having different results and different situations as it relates to
the vaccine. But one thing is inarguable, the more vaccine rollout, the more people feel confident, the more
people feel confident, the more they'll get out and spend and that's why I think when you look at, sort of the –
towards the end of this second quarter into third quarter in the summer, you're going to see people hitting the
roads, you're going to see people hitting the skies especially in the US.

So my question is on the 2.1 million accounts acquired in the quarter. Maybe you could give us some color on the
type of customer, age bracket, income, geography, that kind of thing. And give us a sense of what's resonating?
Is it more the cash back? The T&E? The specific enhancements that you're making on some of the programs,
spend more get more kind of points, bonus points? And a little bit on how you're thinking about this group of new
accounts that you're acquiring and what that means for future spend trajectory and growth rates versus maybe
what you were acquiring pre-pandemic. If there's any compare/contrast there you can share, that would be great.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Okay. Well, let me give you – it's probably a half hour meeting there, but let me go through. So, look, 2.1 million
new cards, normally 2019 you saw us average about 2.5 million new cards. When you look at the consumer
cards, 60% of the cards we acquired were millennial or Gen Z. We saw – in the pandemic, you saw more cash
13


American Express Co.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
back cards being acquired. There was a 35% jump in premium cards that we saw in this particular quarter, and
acquisition of Platinum and Gold Cards was well-above pre-pandemic levels, so we feel good about that.
And just to give you some sort of contrast on that, when you look at our fee-based products, it's still a little bit
lower. I mean, we're acquiring about 60%. It was about 70% in 2019, but sequential increases have helped. We're
seeing co-brand cards come back. I mean we talked about 90% more Delta cards acquired in this quarter than in
the previous quarter and we're seeing a higher-level customer. I mentioned that in my remarks. The FICO is a lot
higher, and we're seeing good spending. So we feel good about both our small business and consumer. We don't
really talk about geographic distribution and things like that, but our intent is not only to acquire cards but we also
when we talk about it, we acquire billed business. And we're on track to do, from a billed business acquired
perspective where we were in 2019. So, we feel good about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I'd add, just to make it clear, Betsy, is that the sequential growth in the travel co-brands has been
tremendous. They're still below where they were pre-pandemic because you still don't have anywhere near as
many people staying at hotels or sitting on airplanes. And so that's what leaves us overall a little bit below the
level of pre-pandemic new card acquisitions, but we're quite confident that will come back, and once you look
beyond that sector, we think we're at great levels today.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask – dig a little bit more on the 70% by year-
end T&E assumption. Is there -it sounds like there's a mix shift between volumes there too between domestic and
international, weighted more towards domestic which I think we all understand. But maybe, is there a difference in
revenue or profitability between that travel in terms of what you make? So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, as
T&E comes back, is the contribution to revenue maybe going to lag a little bit compared to the contribution to
volume just from that mix shift? And then any update on April billing trends? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, no, so when we report the volume, it's the volume and there's no different. Obviously, if people are booking
first class international tickets to Hong Kong, they cost a lot more than first class tickets to Indianapolis. But the
reality is we're giving you volume numbers. So it just means you need a lot more of those tickets to Indianapolis
than you do to Hong Kong. So, no, there isn't – there isn't a difference for us. We're not giving you sort of – when
we talk about volumes, we're not giving you number of trips booked here. What we're doing is we're giving you
actual volumes. So we may have actually more trips. In fact, when we look at – we look at this, we look at receipt
of charges and transactions basically, so we may have more transactions in air and you may have lower dollar,
but that doesn't mean anything to our margins.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I'd add, Mihir, is when you look at our other revenue and other fee and commission lines, there is
some dollars in there that do come, cross-border travel. And as we think about the 2022 aspiration, we don't
actually expect that to be fully back to 2019 levels in 2022. We don't need it to be to hit our 2022 aspirations. I'd
14

actually put that in the category of things Steve talked about earlier that even beyond 2022, there's still probably a
couple remaining tailwinds as the last of cross-border travel and corporate travel begin to come back to 2019
levels post-2022.

Meng Jiao Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the recent expansion of Pay It Plan It to all US consumer
cards. Have you seen any sort of usage acceleration since you expanded that? And then, can you actually frame
for us how big the opportunity set can be and it could apply to that 2022 aspiration that you mentioned? Thank
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, no, so it's really too early to sort of tell on just how much we've got because we really just did it. But it's not
really in – it's not in our calculus to help us make our 2022 number. It's totally upside for us. But again, just to put
it in perspective, you're talking about 6 million plans from inception, you're talking about $5 billion of overall AR,
and it's a convenience feature that we have. Yeah, I'd like to say it was our answer to buy now, pay later, except
we had it before a lot of the buy now, pay laters. We just had it on particular cards, and now we put it on all the
cards. So it really is all about meeting overall Card Members' cash flow needs, and they'll do this versus
potentially revolve on charge or just a normal lending transaction. It gives them more certainty. So it's in the
overall numbers that we have and the overall spending that we have, but I wouldn't say, in any way, shape or
form, it's a big driver of 2022.

So you guys have done a very effective job of adjusting your pre-pandemic value propositions. But can you offer
any thoughts on the work you've done more recently around potential post-pandemic changes and consumer
preferences that may be longer lasting and the risk that that could lead to more permanent changes? For
example, how concerned are you guys about the risk that the value proposition associated with airline lounges
15


American Express Co.
(AXP) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
may not be as great post-COVID? And how confident are you that you'll be able to identify sustainable cost-
effective alternatives to maintain the overall value proposition across your different products to the extent that we
can't just go back to the old, sort of, the older pre-pandemic offerings that you guys had?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so, couple points. So, look, our strategy for the last three years has been to refresh our products on an
ongoing basis, ongoing basis anywhere from sort of three to four years. And so we'll talk more as we refresh
those products, and we'll give you a little bit more color on that. I take the opposite view on sort of the travel value
propositions. I think they're actually going to be even stronger at this point. I think that people are going to want to
have the safety and security of our lounges. We're opening up more lounges. We're not backing away from these
lounges. In fact, we've opened up numerous lounges during the pandemic, and they've turned into a little bit more
of an oasis to people where they know, with our brand, our security, and our reputation, we're going to take as
good care of people in our lounges as possible.
And I think the other thing that – there's a lot of questions we got at this time last year was what's the future of
your travel co-brand cards, and when we look at the month of March, and we look at sort of Delta and we look at
Hilton as just two examples, they're at 2019 spending levels overall. And because people have been
accumulating points and people want status. And as I've said numerous times on these calls, status is probably
even going to be even more important going forward.
So what we will continue to do is we're not going to walk away from our travel value propositions. If anything, I've
been more encouraged that we did the right things, and we'll continue to add though. I mean, I think if you look at
our history over the last three years or so, three and a half years, we've kept our core value proposition and
continued to add. And during the pandemic, I talked about the results we had with wireless and the results we had
with streaming. We got customers who were not using our card for those things. By putting some value in, we're
now four months after the value and they're still spending. And we're doing the same thing. Right now, we've got a
PayPal credit for our Platinum cardholders, and we're picking up more Card Members that didn't use PayPal. And
as I've talked about PayPal and I've talked about some of the other fintech Square and Stripe and so forth, they've
actually not only helped us get more coverage, but have helped us in ways to deliver more value to our Card
Members.
So we feel good about our value propositions. We feel good about the travel value propositions that are in our
products, but we will continue to expand and evolve our value propositions as we have over time. We're not
walking away from that strategy.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Steve, maybe as a follow-up on that. So you injected significant value prop enhancements into the business,
like streaming and wireless, as you just referenced. And I believe some of those will evolve over the next few
quarters. So can you maybe just talk about how you envision repurposing those marketing dollars? I think, Jeff,
you talked about spending a little over $4.5 billion this year. Could we see that come down beyond this year? Or
do you expect to see these enhancements shifted towards customer acquisition and maybe we could see
customer acquisitions above that, those 2.5 million per quarter that you talked about in 2019? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah, so a couple of points. We spent, I think, it was like $1 billion this quarter. Some of that was in value
injection, not the wireless and streaming. Those have ended. This is different types of value injection. But the
majority of that was customer acquisition and customer engagement.
When we look at the rest of the year, I think we said we're going to spend $4.5 billion, but we'll spend up to the
attractive opportunities that are there. If there are not attractive opportunities, we will not spend it. If there are
attractive opportunities, we will spend more if they're there, because we're focused on building that momentum.
Having said that, given that you have sort of probably a six-month value injection window and you've got customer
acquisition and customer retention, more than likely, you will see that overall dollar bucket come down next year
as we go into 2022 when you're not doing that value injection.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only thing I'd add, Ryan, is we've talked about the fact that as you go through this year, to Steve's point, you
need to see the value injection spending come down. And we were pleased this quarter because actually it was
down sequentially. And we still continue to see tremendous customer attrition and retention rates, probably
because the travel-oriented value parts of our value propositions are becoming more valuable to people again.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2021
Yeah. So you probably heard us shuffling the pages to get to 7, 8 and 9. But, yeah, so there's a huge difference. I
mean – so our corporate card is predominantly, it's like 60% travel and entertainment, whereas our SME card is
like 80% goods and services. They use the card to run their business. And as we've talked about travel coming
back, it comes back in layers. It comes back with consumer, then it's SME and then it's large and corporate. So it
is a very different business, which is why we went and acquired Kabbage to have a digital front for these SMEs
where they can not only get their card spending done but also get working capital loans, have a transaction
banking account, have merchant financing loan, have short-term loans and things like that, because small
businesses – small and midsize businesses use this card to really help to run their businesses, which is a
fundamental difference between how corporations use the card, which is to support T&E. And obviously, there's
B2B opportunities with large corporates, but that's why small businesses has come back.
Why our small businesses have done, I think, even better than what you might have thought is, is the dispersion
that we have across the small business arena. And I've said this many times. When people think about small
businesses, they tend to think about the small retail shop or they tend to think about the small restaurant. The
reality is a lot of them didn't do so well during this time. We don't have a tremendous amount of our small
business base there. It is a very diverse base. And when you think about professional services, you think about
cooling and plumbing and electric and all those things, our base is very wide and that has helped us, because
some small business segments during this time have just been through the roof. Others have been hit really hard
and others have – businesses have maintained as they were before the pandemic.

A question on China, I guess, and in debit, as – broader thoughts on debit. So what should we see out of China?
You've changed your reporting somewhat because you expect to see some significant numbers, I guess, out of
China. But you also talked about building debit capability broader than China. And I just wondered what your long-
term thoughts were on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, I think we changed that to provide, I think, the appropriate level of transparency for you guys, because,
obviously, as we've said this all along, G&S volumes are not worth the same to us as G&S as proprietary
volumes, and China volumes are part of that mix. And so that's why we change it to processed volumes.
18


American Express Co.

Because, yes, you're right, over time, we do expect that volume to be very significant, and we wanted to make
sure we were providing the right level of insight so that you guys could make the right assumptions.
And there will be – in China, it'll be charge credit and it'll be debit cards. And so as we build that capability, we will
evaluate where else – if you build that capability for your network, it gives you the capability to do it in other
markets. And so we'll evaluate over time where that makes sense for us to roll that out. So nothing really to
announce here, but I think it's important that you understand the capabilities that we're building as well.
And we're building these capabilities from a global perspective so that we have it. But to also point out, we do
have G&S partners in local markets today that have debit products – have American Express debit products.
They just tend to get used more locally within country as opposed to around the world. And it's important, at some
point, we will have a lot of traveling Chinese Card Members, and it's important that they're able to use all the
products that our partners issued to them all around the world and debit being one of them.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my question. I know you guys have been on here a while. One of the
consequences of the CARD Act was that it shifted the competitive landscape from offering lower rates to higher
rewards, and we think at the peak of the GFC recovery that was particularly challenging for AXP because it had
the impact of basically causing industry offers to converge to your core value propositions. One of the responses
we saw from you is that you moved them to your front foot in terms of targeting millennials for card acquisition. I'm
curious as we sort of enter this new period of expansion and all of your competitors are talking about growth, what
are the lessons you've learned last cycle and either tactically or strategically how will you respond?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I have a different version of the CARD Act than you do. I think our competitors got into this more after the
financial crisis when they really looked at this and said this was a very attractive business. The reality is the
CARD Act had a lot less impact on us because, remember, 80% of our revenues are not from interest and the fact
that interest rates, especially on prior balances, were now controlled, really had less impact on us than it did on
our competitors. Our competitors wound up just growing their overall business, and one of the first things they did
is hire a lot of people from American Express to do that. But look, I think that the lessons that we've learned over
time – and look, I've always said this, we welcome competition. The lessons that we learned over time is you
need to continue to focus in on what your customer needs are and how your customer is changing and evolving.
And this is why, when I took over, one of the first things I said is, we're going to go to a strategy of refreshing our
products on a real ongoing basis.
You cannot have your Green Card sit out there for 30 years and think it's still as relevant 30 years ago as it is
today. Millennials was really not as much a CARD Act. Millennials was us opening our eyes to the fact that our
value proposition had a much broader appeal, and I think that we really started to communicate that. And look,
and I've said this publicly before, I think your company there did a great job of really highlighting premium cards,
I'm talking about JPMorgan, and Gordon and his team did a fantastic job of highlighting premium cards to
millennials. And our value proposition played remarkably well there, and as I just said, 60% of our cards that we
just acquired are millennials.

I think we had to expand our aperture, and we did that. We expanded that aperture, and we realized that the
value proposition that we had could have a wider audience and could have a wider target. And we've done that,
and we will continue to do that. You will continue to see that from a multicultural perspective. You will continue to
see that from millennials. You'll continue to see that with women as well. So I think what we learned is that – since
then is that there is a broader market for our products than we initially thought, number one. Number two, you
always have to keep innovating, and you have to innovate on a regular cycle basis. You can't stand on your
laurels, and I would say that we learned more from some of our trials and tribulations with Costco than we did
from the CARD Act.

Most of my questions have been asked, but just a quick one on credit. Jeff, I think you mentioned you're still
weighting towards the negative or a higher weighting towards the negative scenario in your reserve calculation.
I'm just curious sort of how realistic that is, given sort of where we are and we're looking at delinquency rates here
and the building momentum. Maybe you could just talk about that. And then just one quick one on the expenses.
You mentioned the venture gains helping expenses this quarter. I mean should we just view it as a one-time gain,
or how should we think about that? Was that spent? Thanks.

So on credit, Sanjay, you're correct. For the purposes of our accounting credit reserve, we did significantly weight
a downside scenario, and I think that's in keeping with a little bit of a regulatory view where you have the Federal
Reserve saying to all banks, we're still little – want to see a little bit more time pass before we free everyone to go
back to returning to your appropriate capital levels. So we thought it was appropriate to be that conservative. But
to be clear, the reserve that we have on the books implies that some – that steady recovery that we're in the midst
of now just stops and things get worse. So if it doesn't, then you would expect to see more reserves. The only
other comment I'd make is it's April 23. You're already at the point of the year where you really can't, for the most
part, see write-offs go up significantly this year. Even if bad stuff happens, the actual write-offs would go into next
year.
On OpEx, yes, we did have a $377 million gain on the really great portfolio we have of fintech investments. We
have about 50 different companies we have holdings in. We do partnerships with those companies. It's really all
about those partnerships. But market's been pretty frothy lately, so there was a big gain on a couple of those
companies this quarter. There's also some offsets. When the equity markets are frothy, our deferred comp
balances are a bit of an offset or a hedge almost to the equity investments. I would really think of it, Sanjay,
mostly as a one-time sort of thing. This year the reality is we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome. What
we're focused on is, to the extent we have good investment opportunities, you will see us use the financial
