Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think what our company and our
associates accomplished in 2023 was nothing short of extraordinary, dealing with a significant shift in the banking
landscape and the termination of our planned merger. We've detailed some of our highlights on slide five. Despite
all the disruption this year, our 2023 pre-provision net revenue was essentially flat to the prior year. We saw the
benefit from our asset-sensitive balance sheet with the margin expanding 32 basis points versus 2022. This offset
the decline in revenue from our countercyclical businesses, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business
model. Most of you heard me say that we manage our company with three top priorities in mind: safety and
soundness, profitability, and growth. You saw the benefit of that when our balance sheet was well-positioned to
weather the crisis of a few banks this spring.
This prudent balance sheet management enabled us to better serve our clients and strategically expand market
share. We grew both loans and deposits at significantly higher rates than the industry as a whole, supported by
our exceptionally strong capital levels. Our deposit growth was kick-started by our second quarter campaign. We
raised over $6 billion of new to bank customer funds, and we have retained 96% of that money as of year-end.
We have long tenure, deep relationships with our clients, and we're excited to continue to deliver on the [ph]
promo to primacy (00:03:23) efforts with the clients we acquired in 2023. We have some of the financial highlights
for you on the quarter of – financial highlights for the quarter on slide six. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.32 per
share or pre-provision net revenue of $298 million, resulting in a return on tangible common equity of 11.1%.
We grew the net interest margin 10 basis points from the third quarter as we improved our asset pricing and
balance sheet mix. We anticipate the continued expansion into the first quarter as we successfully normalize
pricing on our promotional deposits, reducing our interest-bearing deposit cost by approximately 15 basis points
at the end of the quarter. We generated 29 basis points of common equity Tier 1 capital this quarter, bringing us
to 11.4% at year-end. As I reflect on 2023, I'm incredibly thankful for the dedication of our associates as they
continue to deliver value for our clients, communities and shareholders.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Hope to run through our financial results in more detail. Hope?

Thank you, Bryan. Good morning. On slide 7, you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for
the quarter. We generated pre-provision net revenue of $298 million this quarter. Net interest income grew $12
million from third quarter, benefiting from asset repricing and our ability to improve the funding mix. This expanded
the margin by 10 basis points from the prior quarter. We expect to build upon this momentum into first quarter
which will benefit from our deposit pricing efforts in late fourth quarter. Fees excluding deferred comp were flat
linked-quarter, benefiting from higher fixed income which was offset by the timing of a couple discrete items. As
expected, expense excluding deferred comp were up $30 million driven by higher variable compensation tied to
revenue and increased strategic investments in the quarter which we expect to moderate in first quarter.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Provision expense was $50 million this quarter, increasing ACL coverage by 4 basis points, which was largely
driven by modest deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios used for CECL modeling, primarily within
commercial real estate and consumer. Tangible book value per share increased 8% to $12.13. On slide 8, we
outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by $0.01 per share. Fourth quarter
notable items include the FDIC special assessment of $68 million, a pre-tax gain of $1 million from the net of a
small opportunistic FHN Financial asset disposition and equities valuation adjustments. Additionally, we had one
notable tax item, a $48 million discrete benefit primarily attributable to the resolution of merger-related tax items
related to the IberiaBank merger. On slide 9, you will see that our margin expanded 10 basis points from the prior
quarter to 3.27%, improving NII by $12 million.
Fourth quarter benefited from a full three months of the rate hike that occurred in July which improved asset
yields. We were also able to use customer deposits and excess cash to pay down a significant amount of
brokered deposits, improving our funding profile. The average rate paid on those brokered deposits was 5.3%.
Though the impact of fourth quarter was modest, our success in repricing the promotional deposits gathered in
our second quarter campaign will benefit margin as we head into 2024. As you can see on slide 10, we've been
successful in executing our deposit strategy this year. Period-end deposits are up 4% year-to-date compared with
a 2% decline in the Fed's H.8 data. Retention of the promotional deposits acquired in the second quarter
campaign has been exceptional so far at 96%. Those promotional rate guarantees expired late in fourth quarter
and we were able to reprice those deposits down by an average of 76 basis points.
This strong retention allowed us to pay down $1.2 billion of higher-cost brokered deposits. Though we're
continuing to see some rotation out of non-interest-bearing, we've been able to acquire just under 1 billion of new-
to-bank interest-bearing accounts at a blended cost of 3.3%, which is down from the 4.2% acquisition rate we saw
in the third quarter. The interest-bearing rate paid of 3.37% this quarter was essentially flat to the prior quarter.
Rates peaked in October and came back down as the promotional accounts were repriced in the back half of the
quarter. The end-of-period rate on interest-bearing deposits declined to approximately 3.25% while the total
deposit rate fell to roughly 2.4%. We expect this to provide upside to NII and margin next quarter.
We have an overview of loans on slide 11. Our strong capital position and ability to grow deposits supported 5%
year-to-date loan growth. Loan demand softened in the fourth quarter with period-end loans declining 1% from the
prior quarter. About half of that decline was due to typically seasonality of loans to mortgage companies. This
business experiences some seasonality, tending to peak in the third quarter, then decrease until hitting first
quarter lows. C&I production was fairly muted as we entered into the quarter, though we saw that stabilizes a bit
in the back half of the quarter. CRE growth continues to be driven by fund-ups from existing loans, primarily in
multifamily. And as you would expect, total commitments have come down slightly as there's not a lot of new
production in that sector. Consumer balances are relatively flat as we're focused on using the balance sheet for
customers like our Medical Doctor program where we continue to build deeper relationships.
We are continuing to improve pricing with spreads on new loans increasing 21 basis points since last quarter and
64 basis points year-over-year. On slide 12, you can see that fee income excluding deferred comps remain stable
at $173 million. Our fixed income business saw an increase of $9 million as the market's expectations that the
Fed has finished raising rates brought some participants back into the market. Mortgage revenue was down $2
million largely due to seasonally lower volume. Brokerage income increased $2 million driven by higher annuity
sales. Card and digital banking fees were down $4 million driven by a methodology adjustment on interchange
rebates, resulting in a one-time impact to fourth quarter. Lastly, other non-interest income declined $5 million
mostly due to elevated FHLB dividends in third quarter as well as a modest reduction in BOLI revenue.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
On slide 13, we show that excluding deferred compensation, adjusted expenses are up $30 million. Personnel
excluding deferred comp was up $14 million from last quarter with a couple of drivers. First, there is about $4
million of incremental incentives in our variable revenue businesses driven by higher production this quarter. We
also accrued $5 million of additional expense, primarily related to the retention awards as the stock price rose
almost 30% this quarter. Lastly, medical expenses were up $5 million linked quarter due to seasonality and a
couple of large one-time claims. Moving on to our strategic investments, you can see the technology investments
entering the run rate in occupancy and equipment. [ph] There should (00:12:30) continue to be modest growth
here as we make progress bringing these projects online. Outside services increased this quarter, driven by a
couple of items.
Marketing was elevated from seasonality and sponsorship and client events that typically occur in fourth quarter,
as well as the impact of some of the delayed costs we mentioned last quarter, primarily related to client
acquisition and brand campaigns we initiated in late third quarter. We also engaged additional third-party
resources for consulting and resource augmentation on key projects. Fourth quarter had elevated expenses due
to these items that will moderate next quarter. Expenses will stabilize as costs and technology investments
increase throughout 2024 but are offset by lower retention expense and other operational efficiencies. I'll cover
asset quality reserves on slide 14. Loan loss provision was $50 million this quarter, down from $110 million in
third quarter, which includes a $79 million idiosyncratic credit loss last quarter. Net charge-offs were $36 million or
23 basis points across multiple industries and sectors.
The ACL coverage ratio increased 4 basis points to 1.4%, driven by marginal deterioration in the macroeconomic
scenarios used for CECL modelling, primarily in CRE and consumer, as well as modest grade migration. We
continue to see credit migration, but we are not seeing any specific pockets of stress. And what we are observing
in this environment feels manageable. On slide 15, you can see that we have continued to build on our strong
capital levels. We generated 29 basis points of CET1 this quarter, bringing us to 11.4%. Adjusting for their marks
on our security portfolio and loan book, our pro forma CET1 ratio would be 9.1%. Total capital remained strong,
reaching 14% this quarter. Tangible book value per share was $12.13, increasing 8%, driven by $0.72 from lower
mark-to-market impact and $0.34 of net income, partially offset by $0.15 of dividends.
On slide 16, we reiterated the 2024 outlook we gave you in December. We expect to grow pre-provision net
revenue from 2023 levels as our ability to generate revenue more than offset our strategic investments. And we
continue to look for operational efficiencies to offset rising costs. Our interest rate outlook assumes four rate cuts
with the first cut occurring in May. Given our ability to reduce funding costs, continued asset repricing and modest
balance sheet growth, we expect net interest income to exceed 2023 levels. Fee income improvement will be
driven by a modest rebound in the countercyclical businesses. The expense outlook includes continued progress
on the strategic technology investments, as well as a modest amount of incremental investment in personnel,
including the annual merit adjustment that went into effect at the beginning of the year. The net charge-off
guidance reflects continued macroeconomic uncertainty.
As we have previously communicated, we do not see a need to continue to build incremental capital, giving us the
opportunity to deploy capital in excess of that 11% CET1 target. I will wrap up on slide 17. We have shown you
this slide several times this year, and Bryan opened with a version of it that listed a few of the things that this team
accomplished in 2023. It is remarkable to reflect on everything that occurred this year. And when I look at this
slide, I'm proud of everything the company did to serve our clients amidst significant industry disruptions and
uncertainty to deliver on the expectations we laid out during Investor Day in second quarter. To recap 2023, our
Investor Day guidance for net interest income was a growth range of 6% to 9%, with actual growth coming in at
6%. Similarly, our fee income guidance was a decline between 6% and 10%, with actual fees down 9%. Lastly,
we gave an expense growth range of 6% to 8%.

At 5%, we came in favorable to that guidance as we found efficiencies to offset other investments. Despite a
challenging environment, our dedicated bankers delivered on our commitment to clients and our diversified
business model, producing consistent pre-provision net revenue year-over-year in 2023, which we anticipate
building on in 2024. We have a strong balance sheet which weathered the challenges the banking industry faced
earlier this year – sorry, earlier last year, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to safety and soundness first.
As always, we stay focused on our clients, communities and associates, which result in strong client and
associate retention. We are well positioned to capitalize on 160-year legacy and I am excited to continue to
demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our franchise in 2024 and beyond.
And with that, I'll give it back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. Our 2023 results reflect the strength of our franchise, and I'm incredibly proud of everything our
associates accomplished this year. Their commitment to serving our clients enabled us to navigate an uncertain
environment and come out of the other side stronger. I continue to remain confident that this company has the
people, the clients and the dedication to build an unparalleled banking franchise in the south. My expectation for
2024 is much like 2023. With all that's going on in the world, the economy continues to perform well and it still
looks like a soft landing is possible. Thank you to our associates for all that you have done for our company, our
clients and communities and our shareholders in 2023.
Bruno, we can now open up for questions.

performance against your guidance, and I just – I wanted to ask about the 2024 NII outlook range and curious
6

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
what kind of an impact do the four cuts have on your net interest income and margin outlook? And what kind of
puts and takes do you have for getting the company to the kind of the lower end to the higher end of the range?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Jon. Appreciate the question and good to hear from you in 2024. As we look at 2024, I know I think
guidance out there from other different rate scenarios, we did use a four rate cut scenario. So the biggest impact
in that range is how many cuts do we get and when. So our first loan is in May, it happens later in the year than
that, we would have a benefit to our margin. The biggest factor that we need – that we have that – in the range
when we look at a couple of different scenarios is how quickly can we reprice down those client deposits. We've
shortened the duration of the promo rates and the deepening rates that we have as our anticipation would be that
as we saw rates decrease, we quickly would be able to offset that in our funding costs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So it's safe to say if we're less than 4%, you're probably at the higher end of that range. If we're at 4%,
we're mid to lower end. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
That's correct, Jon. And also, we could be on the higher range – higher end of the range with 4% if we can bring
down deposit pricing quicker with the rate decreases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Depends on what that lag is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got you on that. And then just – yeah. Okay. And overall thoughts on loan growth for 2024. I was looking for it in
here and I think I may have missed it somewhere, but how are you feeling about overall loan growth
expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, this is Bryan. We feel pretty good about loan growth expectations. We expect to see the balance sheet grow.
So we think, as I said in my closing comments, that the economy is still growing consistently with the end of 2023.
Financial conditions have sort of ebbed and flowed. But, I'd say overall, they're still on the tight side and I expect
that loan growth will be more muted this year as a result of that. Our balance sheet benefits a little bit from the
spring loaded nature, i.e., we have some fund up of some commitments for construction, et cetera, that was set
up a couple of years ago or originated a few years ago. And we feel very, very good about the opportunities we're
7


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
seeing. We're being very selective and the opportunities that we choose to put on our balance sheet. So we
expect a little bit of modest growth, but we don't expect it to be outsized given our outlook for the economy.
Now, to sort of go back to comments that Hope was making about the margin. Our modeling is just based on
taking a forward curve that's implied in the market at some point in time. It could have been [ph] 2.38% (00:22:45)
on December 31. It's moving around a whole lot, which tells you there's a fair amount of uncertainty about what
interest rate will actually do. And the Fed's comments were interpreted as pretty significant cuts and the market
implies. We don't – I personally don't feel that strongly that the Fed's going to cut rates early in the year. I think
rates are going to hold up better or higher than the market's expectations right now, but I wouldn't substitute our
judgment for the market. So we just use a market curve that ultimately reflects what is a slowing economy and
interest rates coming down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to go to the slide 24 in the appendix as it
relates to FHN Financial. I appreciate you guys putting that in there. You guys had a nice uptick in ADRs this
quarter; certainly understand the way this business works. But can you just give us kind of what your baseline
expectation is for ADRs as we kind of move through the year assuming your rate cut expectations and then what
it could look like in your estimation if we move a little bit slower? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. FHN is, as you just implied, very sensitive to what interest rates do. We did see a little pickup in the fourth
quarter of this year, and that was really based on the market reaching a conclusion that the Fed had reached
peak rates and that we're more likely to see rates falling, and falling rates tend to be good for our fixed income
business. Our expectations are for somewhat slightly higher average daily revenue next year. We think the
markets will continue to stabilize and improve, particularly if it follows the path − market follows the path that is
sort of laid out in terms of rate cuts next year. We don't expect that FHN Financial is going to bounce back to 2021
levels, but we do expect some modest improvement next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. And maybe just as my follow-up question, just assuming that – I just want to get a sense for how
much flex there would be in the expense base if the revenues don't necessarily come through. For instance, like,
8


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
is there some technology costs that you could maybe push out? Or what other areas could you look to maybe
kind of address the revenue expectations coming at the lower end of expectations? Thanks
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Yeah. Our expense base at FHN Financial is very heavily tied to revenue, i.e. we have a system that is
scalable cost with scalable revenue. Our team has done, I think, a fantastic job in controlling costs. And even
when you reach the lows in the cycle, we still make money in the business. And clearly, it's not as profitable
[indiscernible] (00:26:22) higher points in the cycle in terms of average daily revenue, but we've got the ability to
control those costs and we will flex them. And we expect that no matter how low ADR is likely to drop in the near-
term, we think we can eke out profitability even at the lowest levels. And with some expectation for higher ADRs,
we expect to be in a much better position through the course of 2024.

Sorry for – if that wasn't clear.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No, but – well, yeah. So expense levels are something that we have acknowledged that we have most control
over. It's something that we will stay focused on. We have demonstrated over a number of years the ability to
control costs and take our costs out of the organization. In terms of the levers that are at hand, we think we have
a number of levers. And in terms – you mentioned specifically technology costs. And while we're investing in
technology, we think those investments are important, particularly the – what I described as deferred maintenance
or remedial investments from last year. There were some things that we had [ph] that get caught up (00:27:55), so
that's a potential lever but it's not one I expect us to pull.
Our overall cost consciousness and the effort we have in the organization I think gives us the ability to control
costs as we sort of move through an environment if revenues don't play out the way we expect. So, again, I think
that overall, cost consciousness will serve us well in 2024.

Operator: Our next question comes from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Casey, your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Quick follow-up on NII, specifically the funding side of things. So first off,
is the $6 billion deposit promotion, is that fully rolled over? And then what kind of deposit beta are you expecting
along these four cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Casey. Good to hear from you in 2024. Yes, we are fully through that repricing of the second
quarter promo campaign and that 96% retention is a up-to-date number as of yesterday. And so it's not a
December 31 number. It is an up-to-date number of what we've seen the retention on that. Through the cycle,
when we think about deposit rate, rising it through the cycles, when do you start cutting rates, and we'd probably
be right around 60%. If we see a May cut, we would end our beta cycle about 60%. If it got later in the year, the
first cut and the cycle continued, we do think that we can continue to moderate by bringing in client deposits,
paying down a little bit more on the wholesale as well. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw a fourth
quarter new-to-bank money at a significantly lower cost than we saw the prior quarter.
So we are seeing the ability to step back, not just existing money and retain it but also bring new money in, about
$1 billion, and each of the last two quarters got lower rate than we saw in the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And just as a follow-up, trying to gauge buyback appetite. It's at – CET1 at 11.4%. You're
comfortably above your 11% target. You do mention organic capital deployment, but it doesn't seem like – I mean,
to Bryan's point, loan growth sounds kind of muted. Is there – it just seems like you guys are being a little vague
on the buyback given the strength. Do you manage CET1 back to that 11% level, or are you going to run above
that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Casey, this is Bryan. At this point, we don't have an authorization with respect to share repurchases. I
expect that that's one of many things that the board will evaluate when we work through sort of our continued
outlook for the remainder of the year. And so, it is one of the tools that we will consider. But ultimately, that's a
board decision that gets made in the context of safety and soundness, outlook on the economy. And so, we
expect to have those discussions. And again, that's one of the leverage, we think, that is on the table to manage
that capital level.

I was curious if we could talk through – I know it's just kind of more philosophical in nature, but for the CD
campaign, you obviously got a lot more money coming in than previously expected or at least kind of what the
implication was. So from that, I get that there's a retention, but how much of that is actually turning into new
business, i.e. something along the line of the income line item or bringing over a relationship in general in terms of
a lending opportunity?

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. In terms of the retention, the retention has been very, very good. And our bankers are, I think, executing
very, very well on what we're referring to as [ph] promo to primacy (00:32:49). And while it is still early, we think
we are making good progress in taking those new-to-bank relationships and broadening and expanding those
relationships. And that doesn't happen instantaneously, but we see early indications that are encouraging.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. And then is that embedded in anything or is that kind of just icing on the cake for 2024 if they start to
bring over wealth or something like that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
But, inherently, that's embedded in our estimates of fee income and net interest margin. So, yeah, inherently, it is
embedded but there's not a specific add-on at this point in terms of the way we manage our forecasting and
budgeting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. And then let's completely switch gears here in terms of just lending appetite. I guess there's so many
competitors here in Southeast. Are they pulling back or reorganizing or something that might have them take their
eye off the ball? Are you seeing additional client add potential? Just from a commercial perspective if you could
highlight any areas within any lending category where you're seeing better risk-adjusted spreads or conversely,
kind of shying away because it really just doesn't make a lot of sense. I get office is an easy low hanging fruit to
call out, but if there's anything more granular than that would be helpful.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Yeah. I'll start then ask Susan to sort of pick up. We sort of get varying degrees of information and a lot of it is
anecdotal. I would say in the middle of 2023 and in the early fall, you saw more people actually pulling back from
the markets in terms of lending appetite and getting out of lines of businesses, which we think created a number
of opportunities for us in things like mortgage warehouse finance, and mortgage warehouse lending, and
restaurant finance and things of that nature. The markets seemed to stabilize a little bit as you got into late 2023,
and whether that was the Fed's essentially loosening financial conditions by talking about the picking of rates and
potential for rate cuts being the topic of 2024. The market seems to have stabilized a little bit in terms of lending
appetite. It has probably gotten a bit more competitive. There're one or two examples of folks who are not taking
new or new-to-bank relationships that are now back into the market, so it ebbs and flows.
All of that said, we feel very good about the opportunities that we are seeing. We try to execute with a very
consistent and steady go-to-market approach. We try not to pull into and out of markets based on what's
happening in the next 25 or 30 days by our estimate. And essentially what we believe is, is how we conduct
ourselves in those periods of volatility are the things that define us for the next 25 years with our clients and our
customers. So we've literally tried to just be very steady and very stable, and as a result, I think we continue to
see a number of attractive opportunities. It's not a high volume because the economy doesn't support that, but
we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in the market. Susan?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I agree with what Bryan was saying. And we do take it through the cycle approach and Bryan says we try
not to have the pendulum swing too much either way when times are really good or when things are a little slower
and more challenging like they are today with the higher interest rate environment. We want to be there for our
clients and communities and we have there and there were some instances this year where we were able to step
up for existing clients when others were not. But it is a market where we're able to get good core underwriting
metrics, good structures, and some good risk adjusted returns on the pricing as well. So again, we want to be
there for clients. We also do think – I think there are some opportunities in our specialty lines, as well as in our
markets to take some generational opportunities potentially away from some competitors who might be having
some kind of disruption in their ability to execute.

Brady Gailey Q

Hey. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start on the credit quality fraud. Last quarter, we saw a little blip
with the shared national credit loss. This quarter, we saw NPAs increase by about 17%. They're still on a
relatively low level, but maybe just updated thoughts on – it feels like credit is normalizing here, but just updated
thoughts on how you're thinking about credit into 2024.

Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Brady. It's Susan. I'll take that. We are being, as I just said on the answer to the last question, very
disappointed in our approach, and we have been for years. And so I do believe that that – this disciplined
approach to client selection, the fact the markets that we're in are very strong will continue to serve us well. As
you pointed out, we've had some downgrades into non-performing and classified, but it's very manageable at this
point. We're not seeing any specific things related to markets, industries, product types at all. We did a lot of deep
dive work in 2023. We'll continue that in 2024. We do it – really do it all the time, especially in the higher interest
rate environment. We're making sure that we're touching – look, touching the portfolio and even at a higher level,
where more executive management is involved in portfolio reviews.
So I feel very good about the fact that we've got discipline in how we're grading and servicing credit. So I think the
outlook is one where we will perform well. Our eyes on the ball and will continue to be conservative both at
origination but also in how we think about grading and marking our lens each and every quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then, First Horizon is about $80 billion in assets now. So you still have some time until
growth takes you to $100 billion. But maybe just an updated thoughts on how you're preparing for that or what you
think the impact will be? And when you think First Horizon could see that $100 billion mark organically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, good morning. The way we're preparing is we're practicing treading water right now. Yeah, we think at the
end of the day that we have some flexibility in terms of managing the balance sheet. And while it's not clear what
the coming $100 billion in [ph] LFI (00:41:08) entails, and particularly with the proposals that are out on Basel III.
So we're taking the time to understand that and to navigate through it. Some aspects of it we're likely to have to
deal with earlier, particularly if the final rule gets issued on resolution planning for $50 billion to $100 billion
organizations. Some of those things will start to work their way into the system. But right now, we're studying
what becoming an alibi looks like. We're preparing the groundwork for it. But at the end of the day, we're not going
to just stumble across $100 billion.
And we have a few years of flexibility and, as I've alluded to, the ability to tread water and keep our balance sheet
at a level that doesn't push us over a bright line threshold accidentally.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thank you. Maybe a follow-up to Brady's credit quality question. Just any color on what the increase in non-
performers was in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. It was really, we had several different industries reflected on the top kind of four that were added. You had
one that's kind of an online retailer. We had one CRE hotel project that was added and then a couple of other just
kind of general C&I credit was kind of the drivers of the – bigger drivers of the increase. One was a – and then
one franchise financed restaurant credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
It looks to us like as we seek the credit portfolios performing that it's still largely driven by idiosyncratic trends as
opposed to broad-based this category of asset or that category of asset. So what I'm really sort of suggesting is
borrowers that start in a more stressed position, more levered, inability to take price, higher cost pressures,
interest rates are getting some – that's stressing some borrowers more than it's stressing others, and so we're not
seeing broad-based trends in the portfolio right now. We're – as Susan said, we're spending a lot of time doing
deep dives and analytics. But at the end of the day, the trends seem to be driven by more idiosyncratic stories
than anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. As an example, the hotel project that we added experienced some construction delays and so they're just a
little behind on where we thought they would be according to plan. So that's an example like Bryan said where it
was related to something not necessarily industry-related and the others would have similar stories of kind of one-
off situations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then going back to expenses and the technology spend specifically, I think the
commentary prior had been around $100 million in technology spend over the next three years. Can you provide
maybe some greater clarity on the cadence of that spend? Is that pretty even over the next three years or some of
that remedial spend as you called out, is that something that's going to be maybe a little bit more forward-
skewed?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Timur, thanks for the question. Technology spend tends to be kind of the back-loaded, and so as the project is
gearing up, you're capitalizing costs, software doesn't go into maintenance yet, and so it is a little bit more back-
loaded. We started to, as we talked about in Q3, kind of undershooting our expenses in the quarter. We've seen
that hit in Q4. Those projects have started up and I said in my prepared remarks we expect at the back half of
next year we will see those costs increase and then increase going into 2025 as the bulk of what we started in the
second half of this year starts to hit the run rate [indiscernible] (00:45:50). And that being said, we are, as we
continue to say, looking at operational efficiency just to figure out how we can offset some of that investment.
14


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
But we do expect – in 2024 we expect that in the back half of the year we're going to offset on a P&L basis the
increased technology spend with the retention dollars that are running off, that we have somewhat flat expenses
throughout the year and we'll continue to focus on looking at how we do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. And then one more if I could. Just on the promo deposits rolling off, that retention is
impressive at 96%. I guess what did those borrower or those clients roll into? Are those back in CDs? Did that
move to money market? And I guess what is the current CD specials out there right now for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
That was all money market that repriced in Q4. Our CDs were actually [ph] a 9 or 11 (00:46:53) on CDs, but were
not as material [indiscernible] (00:46:56) in Q2.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Those rates were down 75, 76 basis points from the special rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The second part of your question was what was the current offers. So our current offer is a deepening relationship
of [ph] 4.25% (00:47:19). And so as you're coming off promo, if you bring more money to the bank, you deepen
your relationship with us, the offer is [ph] 4.25% (00:47:25). You can see we ended up at about 75, 76 basis
points down, so we've gotten pretty far to kind of that [ph] 4.25% (00:47:32), right. There's always some
negotiation in the discussion, but we believe that, overall, that [ph] 4.25% (00:47:39) is the target for new money
coming in.

line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just one more further question for Susan. Do you think that the C&I specifically
would see some deterioration this year or should this quarter still kind of stay intact?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey. I think that, Chris, the interest rate outlook of kind of stable rates may be going down. Again, I think you'll see
mostly stability as well based on the fact that we've done a deep dive of portfolio overviews really throughout
different sectors, C&I increase. I'm not – I feel like we've got things graded in the right place. We're continuing to
15


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
talk to clients. We're stressing – doing stress projections in the underwriter service credit. And so I think absent
some things really changing in the economy, if it were to worsen, obviously, we'd take another look, and it could
impact clients, but based on what we know today, I feel good about kind of a stable outlook at this point based on
what we're seeing now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you for that. And then, Bryan, for you, do you think we'll see consolidation in the industry this year?
And is there a scenario where First Horizon would be interested in buying other banks, even something small to
fill in in the footprint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Chris. I think you might see consolidation start to pick up later in the year. I don't think that it's
going to be a robust environment personally, I think there's still a tremendous number of headwinds. The
purchase accounting mark being the largest at this point. And then I think some of the uncertainty around what
the regulatory landscape looks like, both in the context of what it takes to get the deal approved and how long that
takes, as well as what does it mean if you deal with some of the bright lines like $100 billion in the [ph] LFI
(00:50:04). So I don't expect a tremendous amount of pickup during the course of this year. In terms of First
Horizon, our priorities are executing on the things that we've talked about and that's dealing with the investments
we want to make in technology and continuing to grow customer and client relationships.
If you look backwards, we had spent roughly three years, maybe closer to four, depending on how you counted in,
the merger of Equals integration and then the pre-termination period. So we really want to use this period of 2024
to continue to prove out the power of the franchise that we've built. And we think we have plenty of opportunity to
deploy capital there.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I wanted to circle back on the buyback commentary. Bryan, if I heard you correctly, you said you don't have an
authorization and you're expecting to discuss it with the board. I guess I'd ask, when is your next board meeting
and will it get addressed at that board meeting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, as a matter of fact, our next board meeting is next week. So we always cover financial outlook, capital
management, our capital outlook with our board. So that's a meeting to meeting thing. I don't want to
prognosticate what the board is likely to do or not do at our next meeting. But capital management is one of those
things that we always spend time on. We think about it from the context of adequate capital as we stress test our
balance sheet. And we continue to do that and report it publicly. So I don't want to get into what the board may or
may not consider next week, but it's always a topic in terms of our balance sheet and financial outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Hope, maybe I could ask you. Could you speak to the noninterest-bearing mix that's underlying the
NII guidance that you provided?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brody, we do have a small, you know, so NII got the small increase in non-interest bearing for 2024. We went out
pretty aggressively at the end of Q4 and starting in Q1 with a new-to-bank cash offer for new checking accounts.
We haven't done that before and so we are seeing some positive momentum which I had in my prepared
remarks, but I wouldn't say it's meaningful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And what does it take it to pay off further – further pay down broker deposits? Is it an ability to grow other
deposit sources or would you look to kind of pay down some of that with the securities cash flows that you have
on a quarterly basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
The answer is yes to all of that. We want to continue to bring client money in to offset our loan growth. We do
have loan growth projections next year. And so we are focused on it and you saw us have large push in Q4 on the
marketing front as we get into or Q4 2023 as we get into 2024. And we have paused reinvestment on securities
portfolio. We used our securities portfolio to hedge your interest rate sensitivity. We're happy where we're at and
expect that that cash flow will continue to come back. For us, number one is creating client deposits so we can
lend them to clients. And if we have to be a little bit in brokered for that, we will be. So the bigger thing for us
when we look at brokered going into 2024 is the mortgage warehouse. As you look at the seasonality of there,
17


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

you can possibly see some brokers have to come back in and then out the next quarter. But being our highest
yielding asset and being short-term on the balance sheet, it is a great target for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then one last one for me, and I'm sorry if you totally addressed this question. I think somebody
asked about it a little earlier, was just on that 3.25% spot deposit cost. Is that where we bottom out unless we get
rate cuts or will it incrementally decline from that level in the first quarter as the last of the promo stuff kind of rolls
off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We're anticipating it to decline in Q1 modestly. We do have additional brokered, we can pay off that was laddered
out. If you look at our cash balance at the end of the quarter, the bigger piece will be what is [indiscernible]
(00:55:08) back in Q1, right? So we pay down brokered with the excess money when it comes due or we put it
into loan growth. But I would say 3.25% is definitely...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
...the high point and we'll be bringing it back down till we see rate decrease. We do believe we've hit the peak of
our betas last quarter and that will continue to bring it down. Again not meaningful, but basis point here and there
each quarter is what we're targeting.
