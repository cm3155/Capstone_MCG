Timothy N. Spence
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to thank our employees for the job they did
supporting our customers, communities, and shareholders in 2022. You really held true to our core values and our
vision to be the one bank people most value and trust. JUST Capital and CNBC recently released their annual
study of America's Most JUST Companies, a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by
all stakeholders as defined by the American public. Fifth Third ranked 23rd out of the roughly 1,000 companies
covered in the study and was the highest ranked category four bank. It's a great achievement. Thank you.
Earlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The strength and quality of our
franchise are evident in the numbers. We generated record full year revenue of $8.4 billion, up 6% over the prior
year. We managed expenses down 1% year-over-year, producing positive operating leverage of 700 basis points
and an efficiency ratio of 56%. Net charge-offs for the year were below 20 basis points. As a result, we achieved a
full year return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of 16.5%, which places us in the top quartile of our peer
group.
Just as importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We have a culture of accountability at Fifth Third,
and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last January in every
major caption, including total revenue, expenses, and net charge-offs. As a result, PPNR increased 18%
compared to our original guide of 7%.
We also made important progress on our growth strategies in 2022. We grew consumer households at a peer-
leading organic growth rate of around 2.5%, led by our Southeast markets at 7% and surpassed last year's record
for new quality relationships within our commercial segment. We opened 18 new branches in the Southeast in
2022, bringing our three-year total to over 70 new branches in those markets.
During the year, we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our
peer-leading digitally enabled treasury management managed services and our Momentum Banking product
offerings. You may have seen that most recently, we extended Momentum's Early Pay feature to include income
tax refunds.
Our fintech platforms, Dividend Finance and Provide, continued to scale and achieved top national market shares
with Dividend ranking third and Provide ranking second in their respective markets.
Our fee-generating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for
investment. Strong performance in our capital markets business related to client hedging activities, mortgage
servicing, and treasury management all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued
net AUM inflows in our wealth management business.
During 2022, we remained focused on delivering stable long-term results instead of chasing short-term earnings.
We maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification. The
outcomes of this are evident in our NPA, NPL, and early-stage delinquency ratios, all of which have remained
well-behaved and well-below normalized levels.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Our balance sheet management approach remained centered on providing strong and stable NII performance
across various rate environments. We extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess
liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields, and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection
through 2031. These actions will provide significant long-term benefits in the event of a lower rate environment.
With respect to capital, given our strong PPNR growth and benign credit losses, we exceeded our target CET1
ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases. Our capital priorities for 2023 are to maintain a 9.25%
CET1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth, pay a strong dividend, and continue our share repurchase
program. We expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately $1 billion during
the year.
Jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for 2023, but it is a strong one that is consistent with
our priorities of stability, profitability, and organic growth. We expect to produce another year of strong revenue
growth and operating leverage with full year PPNR growth in the mid to high teens, a return on tangible common
equity ex-AOCI exceeding 17%, and an efficiency ratio below 53%.
We will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives. We'll add another 30 to 35 branches in our
Southeast markets, including our first three in Charleston, South Carolina and several more in the Greenville-
Spartanburg, South Carolina corridor. We'll continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation
to accelerate household growth, and we'll invest in scaling Dividend and Provide.
Lastly, we'll make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and
improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most labor-intensive
processes. You have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind to invest
where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing
what we say we will do.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our
current outlook for 2023.

James C. Leonard
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect
focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and
consumer categories and generated record revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates as
deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets, combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset
generation at higher rates.
Fee income has remained resilient despite the market-related headwinds, and expenses were well-controlled
while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of 56%, which
improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below 52%. Our fourth quarter
PPNR grew 12% compared to last quarter and 40% compared to last year.
Net interest income of approximately $1.6 billion was a record for the bank and increased 5% sequentially and
32% year-over-year. Our NIM expanded 13 basis points for the quarter, while interest-bearing core deposit costs
increased 64 basis points to 105 basis points, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 24%
in the fourth quarter.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Total noninterest income increased 9% sequentially driven by our TRA revenue and commercial banking fees.
That growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher M&A advisory revenue and client
financial risk management revenue, and it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination
fees.
Noninterest expense increased just 1% compared to the year-ago quarter. This expense growth was driven by
our acquisition of Dividend Finance during the year combined with continued investments in Provide,
compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, as well as higher technology and communications
expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Excluding the impacts of Dividend and
Provide, total expenses would have been down 1% year-over-year.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially. Average total
commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in C&I
balances. Growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals. Among our
verticals, production was strongest in energy, including renewables, which increased over 50% year-over-year.
Health care growth was led by Provide with Provide balances up 150% year-over-year. The period-end
commercial revolver utilization rate remained stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer
portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter led by Dividend Finance, as well as growth
in home equity. This was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans.
Average total deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was
partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. Period-end deposits increased 1% compared to the prior
quarter. After the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year, we have achieved solid deposit
outcomes throughout the second half of 2022, reflecting our strong core deposit franchise.
Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy, and our key credit metrics remained well-below
normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 44 basis points was down 2 basis points sequentially. And our commercial
NPA ratio has now declined for nine consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio increased just 1 basis point
sequentially to 22 basis points within our guidance range. The ratio of early-stage loan delinquencies, 30 to 89
days past due, also increased only 2 basis points sequentially and remains below 2019 levels.
From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification
of our loan portfolios through a focus on high-quality relationships.
In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We also
have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in non-prime consumer borrowers among our peers.
In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE. Across all commercial
portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and
continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office CRE. We have focused on positioning our
balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle.
Our strong deposit franchise, our investment portfolio positioning, and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide
protection against lower rates, well-beyond just the next few years, as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending
capabilities from both Dividend and Provide should continue to support our strong through-the-cycle outcomes.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Moving to the ACL. Our ACL build this quarter was $112 million, primarily reflecting loan growth. Dividend
Finance loans contributed $96 million to the ACL build. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic
scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the
unemployment rate reaches 4.2% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a
peak unemployment rate of 7.8%.
Given our expected period-end loan growth, including continued strong production from Dividend Finance, we
currently expect a first quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the
underlying economic scenarios.
Moving to capital. Our CET1 grew from 9.1% to 9.3% during the quarter. The increase in capital reflects our
strong earnings generation, which was partially offset by the impact of a $100 million share repurchase completed
in December.
Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loan growth between 3% and 4% compared to
2022. We expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio, which is expected to increase in
the mid single digits in 2023. We expect line utilization to be stable in the first half of 2023, but then decline
slightly to 36% as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second half of the year. We expect total
consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from Dividend Finance and modest growth from
home equity and card will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage, reflecting the environment.
For the first quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially. We expect
commercial loans to increase 1%, reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking and
assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable. We expect consumer balances to be
stable to down 1%, reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by Dividend loan
originations of $1 billion or so in the first quarter.
From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to be stable to down 1% sequentially, reflecting
seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of 2023. We expect continued
migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core
deposits ending the year in the low 30s.
Shifting to the income statement. Given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management, we
expect full year NII to increase 13% to 14%. Our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively
stable from the second half of 2022 levels and reflects the forward curve as of early January with Fed funds
increasing to 5% in the first quarter and the first 25-basis-point rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Our current outlook assumes total interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 112 basis points in the fourth
quarter of 2022, to increase in the first half of 2023 before settling in around 2% or so in the second half of 2023.
Our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition, which would result in a cumulative
deposit beta by the end of 2023 of around 42% given the two additional rate hikes in our forecast over our
October guidance.
The future impacts of deposit repricing lags combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our
full year 2023 net interest margin increasing 5 basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 NIM. We
expect NII in the first quarter to be down 1% to 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the
quarter, combined with stable loan balances.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
We expect adjusted noninterest income to be relatively stable in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market
share due to our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue,
capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue, and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market
headwinds impacting top line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, as
well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue.
If capital markets conditions do not improve, we would expect to generate improved NII and lowered expenses in
the second half of 2023. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22
million in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in 2023 compared to
around $70 million in the prior year.
We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter
excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to continue
generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by a slowdown in M&A
advisory revenue and the impact of higher earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue, given
the rate environment.
We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook
includes a 1-point headwind each from the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on
January 1; the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which was a reduction in
2022 expenses; and the full year expense impact of Dividend Finance.
We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of
around 10%, consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid
single digits area.
Our outlook assumes we close 25 branches in the first half of 2023 that will deliver in-year expense savings and
also add 30 to 35 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high single digits growth of our
Southeast branch network. We expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 6% to 7%
compared to the fourth quarter.
As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the
timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, expenses would be down
approximately 2% in the first quarter.
In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 9% to 10%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 15% to
17% range. This would result in a sub-53% efficiency ratio for the full year, a 3-point improvement from 2022. We
expect 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35-basis-point range with first quarter net charge-offs in the 25 to
30-basis-point range.
In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management, and commitment to
delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to generate long-
term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees, and shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

Good morning, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you share with us, Tim, when you talk to your business customers, it seems like there's a real disconnect
between everybody's outlook for loan loss reserve building. We understand, of course, that CECL and you're
going to be proactive life of loan losses, and you and your peers are building up the reserves.
But then you look at the spreads in the high-yield market, they're coming in. One of your competitors yesterday
pointed out that the commercial loan spreads haven't widened out. Where is the disconnect or are we just going
to fall off a cliff possibly in the second half of the year? But can you share with us what are your commercial
customers seeing in their day-to-day business? And are they seeing the weakness that everybody is projecting
that will happen later this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Sure, Gerard, and thanks for the question. I don't think we're going to fall off a cliff in the second half of the
year. That's certainly not consistent with what I hear. I was out, and when we looked at the calendar the other
day, I think 8 – get into 8 of our 15 markets in the fourth quarter this past year. I think I probably saw 40 or 50
clients while I was out there.
I mean, here's what I hear. Like, if you look at the manufacturing clients as an example, they're all feeling much
more optimistic about moderation as it relates to raw materials. And I think, by and large, they solved the supply
chain issues that they were facing, either through inventory builds or through restructuring the supply chain or
because the overseas suppliers that they were relying on have come back online or there isn't an issue in the
ports or otherwise.
I think the issues they're running into are twofold. One, labor continues to be a challenge. And it's labor cost, but
it's also just labor availability. Two, because they solved their supply chain challenges through building inventory,
8

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
when you think about lower inventory turns, you add in rising interest rates now, debt service costs to revenue are
a higher proportion. And so while they got the costs associated with raw materials through this last year in price
increases, they're all looking to the next 18 to 24 months to try to figure out how they pass on then just the sort of
continued slow grind on labor and debt service costs.
The services clients are having no problem pushing through costs, which I think is, like, evident in the inflation
data and personally to anybody that took a vacation over the holidays this year. And they continue to be optimistic
because demand has remained strong.
I think what I hear more than anything else is that we're going to have a little bit of a slow grind down here in
terms of growth. And that if anything, the thing I'm more worried about is not do we end up with plus 0.5% GDP or
minus 0.5% GDP, but rather that the market may be overly optimistic about how quickly the Fed is going to be
able to bring rates down. And that the byproduct of that is, from an operating standpoint, you have to be thinking a
lot more about how you position the balance sheet for the next three to five years and for more tepid growth and
higher rates than worrying about the next, call it, 12 months in terms of the outlook.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Very helpful. Jamie, sort of coming back to you on one of your favorite topics, AOCI, can you share
with us two things? One, what does the accretion look like coming into 2023 for the AOCI number? And second,
in your securities portfolio, I think you showed in your release that the taxable securities are yielding 3% today.
What are you guys seeing in new yields as you put money to work?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, Gerard. And I knew when we put you in the queue, I was going to get an AOCI question. So,
thanks for living up to that. In terms of the AOCI, if you look at year-end levels with the 10-year at roughly 3.87%,
the AOCI earns back with our duration at 5.4. It earns back pretty evenly across that time period. So, $1 billion or
so of TCE earn-back per year. Obviously, no capital impact given that we're Category IV. If you fast forward to
today and where the 10-year is, certainly we've had a significant improvement in the AOCI just in the first 19 days
of January. So, that would be helpful to the TCE as well.
In terms of the securities yields, obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is positioned at a 3% yield. I
would expect that what's going to happen with the investment portfolio is that it will continue to grind higher each
quarter and finish the year at a 3.10% level. So, the average for the year is probably in the 3.05% range because
as we're reinvesting cash flows or seeing opportunities on new investments, we're looking at entry points in that
4.75% area right now.

Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I know you guys – I think it was your phrase that – held-to-maturity securities were like being in the roach motel, if
I got that right. And you have – what it's like hardly any securities in held to maturity, which gives you flexibility.
And I'm not sure how much that matters, and maybe just gives you more flexibility as you look ahead. But you're
also one of the few banks that are – if you take the midpoint of your guidance, you're guiding for higher NII off
fourth quarter levels. And I'm – is there a connection between how you're managing your securities book and that
guidance, or are they separate? But really, the question is NII guide as it relates to your securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, it's Jamie. Yes. I did reference the roach motel a few quarters back. And I guess today's theme is the
held to maturity is more like a hide to maturity. And it certainly helps having that flexibility to reposition as
environments change.
But really, there's no one thing that's driving the strong NII outlook and NIM expansion for us. It really is the result
of years of hard work, of deliberately positioning the balance sheet for, really, what is a range of outcomes that
still could play out given all of the uncertainty. And it really is a total company effort. And that comes from the
household growth, new commercial relationships, product innovation, the fintech acquisitions, and ultimately sales
execution, both on loan pricing and deposit generation. So, that's really what is giving us the ability to grow NII
during the course of 2023, as well as expanding NIM at the same time.
And I think it's one of those capabilities of Fifth Third that we've proven over the past decade that's perhaps
underappreciated by the market. And like you said, the securities are certainly going to be a higher level of gross
income over the course of 2023 in part because we were patient in deploying the excess cash that we had and
not buying securities when the 10-year was below 2% or even below 1% like some of the other banks.
I think one of the bigger differentiators for us will be the fixed rate loan businesses that we have and our ability to
emphasize or deemphasize those businesses. And right now, we have a little bit of an emphasis on auto being
able to generate roughly $6 billion this year and then Dividend, where the gross income on Dividend will exceed
over $200 million of growth in 2023 relative to 2022.
And so, really, when you package it all together with an investment portfolio that's in a net discount position of
about $1 billion, a Dividend portfolio that, by the end of 2023 will have unamortized fees that will roll through NII of
about $1 billion, we've got a lot of downside protection. And a core franchise that, with its ability to grow loans and
deposits, really is helpful. And within all of this guide, we do not assume spread widening. So, to the extent that
were to happen, as Tim mentioned, that would only be upside to our guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, Tim, just a broader level, I mean, do you see a recession based on your bottom-up analysis, based on
all the markets you're visiting, based on the clients you're talking to? I mean, I – we hear so much recession talk,
10

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
and then we hear about your loan growth and everything else. What do you just think from a high-level
standpoint? And then what are your assumptions for reserves in terms of unemployment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I'll let Jamie field the question on the specific assumptions on reserves, Mike. But I probably lost my crystal
ball when I moved offices earlier this past year, so I have to rely on what I hear from clients or what we get from
our friends at Moody's and otherwise.
If you ask me today, I would tell you we're going to have a shallow recession – but I don't know that there is a big
difference between 0.5% of growth and 0.5% of GDP decline, in particular, given the amount of derisking that's
been done inside the banking sector and certainly inside Fifth Third over the course of the past decade.
I think the more interesting dynamic really is going to be this question about the duration of a recession if we see
it and what happens if we don't get a typical recovery, right? If you have several years of below trend growth and
inflation that sits above the historic – certainly above the historic 2% target.
But, Jamie, you want to field the question on the inputs on the reserves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, as you know, we used the Moody's scenarios of their baseline scenario, and that drives 80%
weighting. And we maintained our weightings at 80%, 10%, 10%, with the upside and the adverse scenario or
10% probability scenario. So, in the adverse, the unemployment gets almost up to 8%, and the baseline
unemployment ratchets up to 4.2%. And then we blend those scenarios together to drive the ACL. So, I think it
meshes well with what Tim's comments were of a shallow or mild downturn in the economy and then a recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, that's 20% for the 8% unemployment and 80% for the 4.2% unemployment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
10% on the upside, which is the upside scenario is that the Fed delivers a soft landing. So, unemployment stays
in the high-3s. So, 10% in the high-3s, the baseline at 4.2% peak, and then a downside at 10% at a 7.8%
unemployment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

Got it. All right. Thank you.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Jamie, I guess it doesn't – based on what you said,
it doesn't feel like you would get there anytime soon. But in the past, you talked about sort of the 3.30% margin
floor in the event of low rates.
Just curious, given all the sort of the ebbs and flows we had in expectations and just the own – pardon me, the
moves you've made with your own balance sheet, how are you thinking about that lower bound kind of as we go
forward in that 3.30% level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. We feel very good about the ability to have a floor on the NIM at that 3.30% level and a down 200 basis
points scenario should that play out, given all the work we've done on the investment portfolio with the bullet
locked-out cash flows, along with being in a fairly sizable net discount position and the duration that we have,
combined with the fixed rate loan origination platforms with Auto, Dividend and Provide, those should all provide
yields.
And then as we've talked in the past, we've layered in $15 billion of receive-fixed swaps that will also provide
additional protection from 2025 through 2032. And that may be one other differentiator for us relative to peers is
that we've been focused more on protecting that downside over a longer period of time, and therefore the duration
of our swap book as well as our investment portfolio maybe a little better positioned should that downturn occur at
the end of the decade.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you. And then switching gears just a bit, maybe some thoughts on kind of the trajectory of fees as
we go through the year? You guys always have the seasonality that helps fourth quarter, hurts the first. But it will
be, I think, a pretty substantial ramp-up starting in the 2Q.
Just curious, I think you alluded to capital markets kind of normalizing or recovering in the second half of the year.
Just maybe your thoughts on main drivers as the year plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure. Thanks. When it comes to the fee income, we did say relatively stable over the course of the year and it
probably is helpful to look at it from two components.
The first would be a category I'll call the factors in our control that do deliver nice growth, both from a strong
customer acquisition perspective, as well as overall fee generation from a combination of the branch network, our
wealth business, the commercial business that will drive both credit card income, as well as wealth and asset
management fees in the mid single-digit area; and top line fee equivalent growth in the treasury management
area in the high single-digit area, given our strong product lineup.
From there, transitioning to mortgage, that's actually going to be the largest growth item for us in 2023, and it
really goes back to all the work that we put into growing the servicing business in 2020 and 2021 when levels
were more depressed. It was a good buying opportunity. And so given our strong mortgage servicing platform,
12

(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
we'll increase those fees from $125 million in 2022 to the $160 million area. So, that's a growth of almost 30%,
whereas top line mortgage should be relatively stable off very low-levels. So, we feel good about those items.
Capital markets are certainly the wildcard in our guide, given that we do expect mid to high single digits growth in
the first half of the year relative to the first half of 2022. And then we assume a little bit of additional growth in the
back half of the year under the assumption that the capital markets disruption should abate once the Fed reaches
its terminal Fed funds level.
And, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, if that were to not happen, then we would expect a little bit better
loan growth, little bit better NII, and lower expenses. So, in terms of PPNR, on a relative basis, I feel confident in
that should the capital markets improvement not occur.
And then the other category, when it comes to fees, it would be the headwinds facing us. So, they're really
environmental given the increase in interest rates, and that's on the earnings credit. We're managing earnings
credits to about a 20% beta, which is a little bit better than what we thought as we entered the cycle. But even
with that, service charges ultimately will be down mid-single digits for the year, which more than offset that strong
top line fee equivalent growth.
On the consumer overdraft and NSF side, we probably do a little bit better relative to peers, just given that we
moved sooner on some of those fee and structural changes. But overall, the first half of the year will be a little bit
softer as we lap those changes that occurred mid-year 2022. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, the
TRA will decline in 2023, as will our expectations on lower private equity income so that other fees will be down
20%, 25% or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think if there's one thing I might add there, it's while we expect capital markets to improve this year, I would not
say we expect them to normalize or recover with the investments that have been made in that business. A full
recovery in capital markets would result in a substantially larger business and revenue footprint than we're
anticipating this year. We just don't expect it to be as bad or as locked up as we saw in 2022.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I was wondering, can you just walk through the puts and takes around deposit growth in 2023? I mean, it seems
like the expansion in the Southeast is definitely a tailwind here. So, how are you thinking about deposit growth,
especially given the more challenging macro backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. This is Bryan. Certainly, we feel good about our franchise and the improvements that we've made over the
years. We have a very strong new customer origination engine, both across consumer and commercial. We've got
strong new consumer household growth, strong NQRs from a commercial perspective. We have a very high-
performing treasury management business that provides a lot of deposit support, as well as growth. And as you
mentioned, our Southeast branch expansion, obviously, is going to create a tailwind for us as well.
And finally, we have proven and analytically driven customer offers that have done a really nice job through the
cycle and driving new balances when we need them. So, we continue to maintain a lot of confidence in the
environment that we're going to be able to deliver and gain our fair share of deposits as the environment changes.
Obviously, we can't grow in all environments, but we are cautiously optimistic and well-positioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And just to put a number narrowly on the Southeast, like, we grew consumer deposits by over 6% in the
Southeast this past year, to Bryan's point. That is – and to yours, Manan, that has been a tailwind for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Helpful. And then maybe the flip side of that is the wholesale funding. We saw you had some wholesale
funding earlier in the year. So, are those balances where you'd like them to be for now? And how does that fit into
the overall funding strategy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. We're very comfortable with where we are from a wholesale funding perspective. We continue to have very
significant contingent liquidity sources that help us manage through uncertainty in the environment. If we see
decent deposit growth, we could see those wholesale funding balances come down over time. But we have a lot
of flexibility across our funding base to help us manage through both liquidity needs, as well as net interest
income.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just had one follow-up question on the credit comments earlier, Tim. You mentioned about the
resiliency of the bank. But when we think about your scenario of higher for longer rates, do you think that begins
to weigh on your customers when you look at either on C&I or on the CRE book that the longer the Fed rate has
to stay at the 5-plus rate, their cost of equity capital is going higher, demand is falling off? And does that lead to a
lot more pain on credit maybe not even later in the year, into 2024 absent Fed rate cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Let me give you the quick answer, and then I'll let Richard comment. Absolutely. I think that is our view, is
that it's more of a slow-growing dynamic here than a cliff, right, as Gerard mentioned earlier. And that the longer
that we go with rates at elevated levels, the more pressure that it places on business – commercial borrowers, in
particular.
I think our consumer borrower is a little bit different because such a significant share of our consumer lending is
done to homeowners that they've had the ability to inoculate themselves a little bit from inflation because they
locked in these historically low fixed rate costs of housing.
Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about where specifically you think that grind may take a toll?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Ebrahim, I think there's a couple of things here. To your question specifically, clearly, higher interest rates
for longer is going to put pressure across the board. And I think that's, frankly, by design from a Fed standpoint to
get things to slow down. The biggest impact is going to be in the leverage lending portfolio. We're starting with
higher levels of leverage. Clearly, higher interest rates impact free cash flow.
One of the things that we do is, when we do our underwriting and, frankly, our quarterly monitoring is, we will go
back and look at the rate curve. And in fact, we look at – and we underwrite the rate curve, forward curve, plus
200 basis points to make sure that there's enough cushion in free cash flow so that while we're underwriting and
taking on these loans, we believe these borrowers can withstand the pressure of higher rates through their
margins and free cash flow.
I think the other thing we're watching for as we think about the economy, and Tim referenced, labor, both cost and
availability. That, in certain segments, continues to put pressure on margins, particularly for those industries that
have a mismatch between the revenue management and their expense management. So, maybe they've got
long-term fixed price sales contracts. They've got to manage through with short-term labor. And probably the most
acute example of where this is happening is in pockets of health care, senior living. We've talked about not-for-
profit hospitals, which have low margins.
The cost to deliver care and service has gone up pretty dramatically. You can look at nursing availability and
wages as a really good example. And there's a lag there in the revenue cycle in terms of reimbursement rates,
whether it's public or private, where these companies – for these companies to maintain margins, profitability. And
so in those cases, we're looking at other things: the quality of the balance sheet, liquidity, and liquidity burn rates.
But no question that as rates are higher for longer, it puts pressure on businesses.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
I think the last thing, and this is part of client selection, is understanding the ability of our borrowers to adapt and
the resilience to these things. So, it's not just a situation where rates are higher and companies don't adapt or
consumers don't adapt. And it's part of the relationship model and part of the way we go to market in terms of the
advice and counsel with our customers, understanding what's happening, looking for alternatives, finding new
ways to finance these customers. So, that resilience through the cycle will continue to endure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That was helpful. And I guess just one quick follow-up, Jamie, on Dividend Finance. About $100 million of
provisioning. Anything else around Dividend Finance in terms of growth outlook this year versus last year that we
should be aware of? Are things picking up or slowing down as we think about just the underlying growth in the
business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. We feel very good about the business that Dividend is doing, especially on the solar side of the aisle. And
for us, we're expecting roughly $4.5 billion of originations in 2023 with a weighting of 90% solar, 10% home
improvement. Home improvement, we're less enamored with. But, again, it's a good product offering for other
points in the cycle. So, it's being deemphasized, and solar continues to do incredibly well. And if anything, there's
perhaps a little bit of upside to our NII guide on Dividend for 2023, just given the strength of the business, as well
as the pricing power.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Timothy N. Spence A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On the credit front, I know you gave us really good detail on delinquencies and nonaccruals. Do you have what
criticized assets did in the quarter? And what areas of criticized may have migrated negatively?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. This is Richard. Thanks for the question. Criticized assets were flat for the quarter, both nominally – I think
we had a little bit of loan growth. So, about 3 basis points of commercial crit improvement across the board. I
16


Fifth Third Bancorp

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
would also point out that, in addition to crit being stable, delinquencies 30 to 89, 90 and above, NPAs – charge-
offs were all down for the quarter on the commercial side.
I think the things we're watching, and I hit on it a little bit, health care, specifically not-for-profit hospitals and
senior living for the reasons we just talked about, we've seen some pressure there because of the mismatch
between the revenue management and the expense management.
A little bit of pressure in – or watching in commercial specialty products, consumer specialty products, right?
That's a function of consumers shifting from durables and discretionaries to consumables and nondiscretionary,
and supply chain and inventory management issues. That's the trading down issue. And that's where we've seen
most of the movement. The leverage portfolio, from an asset quality standpoint, has been stable and operating
within our expectations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then sticking to credit, just my follow-up is around both commercial real
estate and home equity. In commercial real estate, it looks like you did see pretty noteworthy move-up in
delinquencies, as well as the nonaccruals. And so can you guys talk a little bit about property types within
commercial real estate where you're seeing a little bit of stress and where your loan-to-value ratios are? And then
in home equity, it looks like you also saw a pretty noteworthy increase in delinquencies there. Just want to get
color around that portfolio. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Let me take commercial real estate. I think when you think about the delinquencies – if you look at the
delinquencies, and this is on the slide deck, on slide 30, 90-plus is still zero. We've got none. Movements in 30 to
89, 6 basis points. It's off a really, really low base. So, it's not something that we're concerned about from a
commercial real estate perspective.
I think the thing we're watching for, we're watching – and I know a lot of people got questions on office. We're
watching office. That's a small number for us. In fact, our performance in office is actually in line with or better
than the rest of the commercial bank. But there is some pressure there as occupancy attendance and lease rates
continue to – and sublease rates continue to fall.
I think there's a couple of things. We've got a very small amount of urban central business district office. That's
where most of the pressure is in terms of subletting rates. That, for us, is Class A property. I would also tell you
that, in addition to class, vintage matters. That's all new product. It's a new product. It's ESG, qualified LEED Gold
and Platinum. It has all the modern amenities. So, we feel really good about those particular properties.
The rest of our office portfolio sits more in suburban markets. And, again, you just don't have the same pressure
from a lease rate, sublease rate, and a tenant's perspective across the board. Across the rest of commercial real
estate, multifamily continues to perform very well. The demographic trends, the household formation continue to
be strong. Rental rates continue to accelerate faster than construction costs. So, again, there's a positive tailwind
there.
Same thing with industrial demand. This kind of goes back to the reshoring thing trend. Industrial demand is really
strong, continues – lease rates continue to hold in. So, we feel really good there. Hospitality is stable, and that
17


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
continues to be a good trend. And then in retail is stable. So, feeling really good about where we are from an
overall perspective in commercial real estate.
You want to add a comment there, Tim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
And, John, I just was going to say on the equity side, all you're seeing, I think, in the consumer for us at the
moment is just seasonality. Like, sequential comps from the third quarter to the fourth quarter are the wrong
comparisons. Just given the natural seasonality in those businesses, I think it's better just to look at year-over-
year. And we expect consumer credit to normalize over time. That's reflected in the guide that we gave. But the
delinquency dynamics there are really no different than what you would have seen pre-pandemic, other than the
fact that they're still muted relative to what we would have had in the past.
So, I – personally, home equity is not the area that's been an area of focus for me, that's for certain.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. Yeah. No. I got that. I just saw the reserve addition as well to the home equity allowance...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
But actually I think the dynamic there is that for the first time in as long as I've been at the bank, we actually had
quarter-over-quarter home equity growth. So, that's what's driving that outcome, but not a change in perspective
for us on the quality of the credit or the likely outcomes there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I might have misheard the comment on the indirect auto kind of loan growth expectations for this
year. Can you just repeat that, what the strategy is and what you're seeing in the spreads there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Actually, spreads have done well and are actually off to a very solid start in 2023. We finished the year in
2022 with 7.1 billion of production, if you take auto as well as the RV, marine and specialty business combined.
So, that fixed rate consumer secured loan category. Our expectation for 2023 for that asset class is to be down to
about 6 billion or so. So, loan balances in that caption, we would expect to be down. However, yields, we expect
to improve about 100 basis points from the fourth quarter 2022 levels to fourth quarter 2023 levels. So, it is a nice
accelerator to the earlier question around how are you able to deliver both NII growth and NIM expansion. That
certainly is a helpful driver.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just separately on the capital level, we're seeing some divergence in targeted capital out there.
Obviously, there's like upward pressure at the biggest banks, not really relevant to you. But then some of your
peers are targeting closer to 10%. And I'm certainly on board with 9%, seeming very high. But I'm wondering, is
there any kind of behind-the-scenes pressure, whether it's rating agencies or regulators to just hold a little bit
more, given some of the macro uncertainty or anything else that we're not seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking. I would say that, as this environment unfolds, it really is, to your
point, going to create differentiation in both performance execution and overall balance sheet positioning. We've, I
think, for a number of quarters and years now, been discussing how cautious our outlook is. And that has really
informed what we're willing to do from a credit risk appetite perspective. So, the capital levels ultimately are a
factor of the credit profile of what's on the sheet, as well as the reserve levels that we have.
So, the CET1 level at 9.25% and an ACL level of 1.98% creates a very sufficient loss absorption capacity. And
given our SCB level is at the minimum, I think external factors or forces would say that we're very well-positioned
from a credit profile perspective, as well as from a loss absorption capacity. So, we feel good about that.

Benjamin Raisbeck Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. This is Ben Raisbeck on for Ken. Just a quick follow-up on the Dividend Finance. As those originations
continue to ramp up and mortgage loans go on balance sheet, when do you ultimately see that NII benefit
overcoming those reserve builds and becoming accretive to earnings? And then can you just remind us of what
type of loss rates you're assuming on those Dividend loans? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. Great question. The PPNR levels for Dividend will be positive in the back half of – or in 2023. The net
income of Dividend post-ACL will be positive or accretive in 2024. Certainly, if prepayments accelerate faster than
what we have modeled, then that large amount of unamortized platform fees will come through the P&L, would it
improve or accelerate the return profile. But for now, that's how we have it playing out. And we model roughly an
eight-year life on the Dividend asset, and that we would expect to have loss rates in the 125-basis-point area on a
blended basis for the portfolio per year over those eight years.
