Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the
operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second
quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.
Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Our results
included a $576 million impairment of equity securities predominantly in our venture capital business due to
market conditions. Revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher
loan balances was more than offset by lower noninterest income as market conditions negatively impacted our
venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking, and wealth management advisory businesses. We
continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary
pressures and higher operating losses.
We have broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first
quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong. Our allowance reflected an increase due to loan
growth. While we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates, and the slowing
economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking
at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first
quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels.

Overall, our consumer deposit customers helped indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends are
not showing elevated risk concerns; however, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential
stress and for certain cohorts of customers. We have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic
levels, following the final federal stimulus payments early last year, and their debit card spend has also been
declining.
Overall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago, when consumers received stimulus payments,
and inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending including a 26% increase in fuel, driven by
higher prices, while discretionary categories, like apparel and home improvement spending were down double
digits driven by fewer transactions.
Credit card spend increased 28% from a year ago, above the industry trend, driven by the new products we
launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories; however, spending, while still strong,
started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remained below pre-pandemic levels.
Payment rates remain strong, and delinquency rates remain low. Our small business portfolio continues to
perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators, such as payment rates,
deposit levels, utilization, and revolving debt trends, do not yet indicate signs of stress.
Loan demand from our commercial customers remained strong, with broad-based balance and commitment
growth. Our commercial customer's credit performance remained strong, with exceptionally low net charge-offs
and nonaccrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years; however, we are monitoring early warning
indicators across portfolios, including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for
inflation impacts.
Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our work to build an appropriate risk
and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses
to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card
offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph. Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer
credit card business, with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive
offerings, and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including
restaurants, travel, and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards-based cards we plan to introduce.
We continued to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our
automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better
experience for both new and experienced investors.
During the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and
experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships. We are working towards
offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where
they sit within our individual businesses. We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to
provide a more compelling offering for Premier clients.
We started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for
non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half
of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a
negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a
new, easy, short-term credit product. We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid

overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers
manage their finances.
We also continued to invest to better serve our commercial customers, and early in the second quarter, Tim
O'Hara joined Corporate Investment Bank (sic) [Corporate & Investment Bank] (00:08:05) from BlackRock as
head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater
partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients, and he complements the strong
leadership team in our Markets and Commercial Real Estate businesses who have helped us navigate recent
market volatility.
We believe we have significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with Corporate and
Investment Banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance. We also believe that for us to
be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. Last
week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from the Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of
Social impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo
Foundation. We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction
targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors.
As homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home
construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the US in collaboration with Habitat
for Humanity and Rebuilding Together. We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority
homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services.
We continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the
small business resource navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and
technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country. We are also
helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connect to
More program with complementary mentorship opportunities.
We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results
we've made on our DE&I initiatives. For example, in the US, our external hiring of individuals from racially or
ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately one-third of all
internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse. As I've said in the past, advancing
DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project, and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives
in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact.
Let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to
an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is
expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers. Despite the economic
environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest
income growth to continue, given rising interest rates, which should more than offset any further near-term
pressure on non-interest income.
We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in
the past on a run-rate basis in the second half of this year and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's
Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and
communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock
repurchases. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by

20% with $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled
meeting later this month.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common
share, which included strong growth in net interest income, as we are beginning to see the positive impact of
higher interest rates. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our
venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615
million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7
billion of gains on equity securities. While credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million
increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth. This follows six consecutive quarterly decreases in
the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago.
We highlight capital on slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first
quarter, as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings. Our
CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets, as
well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities to held-to-maturity and hedging securities in our
available-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter, but as Charlie
highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through
dividends and common stock repurchases. We will continue to be prudent and consider current market
conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential
economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Our
10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers. As a reminder, based on
the recent federal stress test, our stress capital buffer for October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, is expected to
be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%.
Turning to credit quality on slide 5. Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis
points in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels,
and we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very
disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses
with only two basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our
Commercial Real Estate portfolio. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and total
consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans, as lower
losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses.
Non-performing assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer
nonaccruals were driven by declines in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment
performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Commercial nonaccruals
continue to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, were at the lowest levels in over 10 years. Our allowance for
credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that
was due to loan growth.
On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% from the first
quarter. Period end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with
6

increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when
discussing operating segment results.
Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting
benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year-ago, with growth in Consumer
Banking and Lending offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits
from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth
clients. Our average deposit costs increased 1 basis point from the first quarter, driven by Corporate, Investment
Banking. As I've previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise, and
customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would likely increase as well.
Turning to net interest income on slide 7. Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a
year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by
the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization for mortgage-
backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter.
We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021.
Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens. With the market now expecting not only
more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately
20% from 2021. And as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including
the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth.
On slide 8, on non-interest income, this quarter, we included highlighting non-interest income to show that the
decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses: mortgage
banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates, and our affiliated venture capital and private
equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter
of this year due to significantly different market conditions. While all other non-interest income included both
positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other non-interest
income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures.
Turning to expenses on slide 9. Non-interest expense declined 3% from a year ago, as expenses related to
divestitures came out of the run-rate and we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating
losses increased $273 million from a year ago, and primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which
included a recovery in the second quarter of last year, and higher customer remediation expense predominantly
for a variety of historical matters. Customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of
time to resolve and quantify the full impact. While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the
remaining items.
We're halfway through the year and while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue-related
expenses are trending lower than expected. Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress
we're making on our efficiency initiatives, with lower head count and reductions in both professional and outside
services expense and occupancy expense. We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives.
Putting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion, as
lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have
outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations, and the related expenses could be
significant and are hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 10. Consumer and
Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates
and higher deposit balances. Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over
time. As Charlie highlighted, deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll
out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection
transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year which will further reduce deposit-
related fees.
Home Lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter, driven by lower mortgage
originations and compressed margins given the higher-rate environment and continued competitive pricing in
response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage
rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher-rates also reduced revenue
from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to
remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that it will further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in
the third quarter. We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and
we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple quarters. Credit Card revenue was up 7%. Auto
revenue increased 5%, and Personal Lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 10% from the first quarter,
with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of
total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the first quarter, driven by
the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans
purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.
Turning to Auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter, due to
increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures.
Turning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago, as
increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement. Credit card
point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago, with the largest increases in fuel, travel, and
entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% increase
in credit card balances from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 27% from a year
ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances. Asset-Based Lending
and Leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Non-interest expense
increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower
personnel expense, with head count down 9% from a year ago. Average loan balances have grown for four
consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they still aren't
back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital
growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation. We also had momentum from adding new clients in
Middle Market Banking, and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients. Average
deposits declined 2% from a year ago, driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has
been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase.
Turning to Corporate, Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily
driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan
balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and $107 million write-down on
8

unfunded leverage finance commitments due to the market spread widening. Average loan balances were up
20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to
increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures.
Commercial Real Estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates.
Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago, with the disruption in the capital markets increasing
demand for bank financing and line utilization. Markets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to
higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue, as clients positioned themselves for rising rates,
quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns, as well as higher equities trading.
Average deposits in Corporate, Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions
to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in Corporate Banking than we've
seen in Commercial Banking.
On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago, as the increase in net
interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-
based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity. As a
reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter
results reflected market valuations as of April 1, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as
of July 1. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter, and approximately two-
thirds of our advisory assets are in equities. So there will be another step-down in our asset-based fees next
quarter. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based
lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter, as clients
reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly.
Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago and were
impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and
the sale of student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of
2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio, and they accounted for approximately $375
million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-
down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in corporate was also due to
lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.
In summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined, driven by lower venture capital, mortgage
banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity, with expenses declining and
strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances. As we look ahead to the second half
of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on non-interest
income. While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels , our consumer and commercial
customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress. As I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the
year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion, subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier. Finally our
stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20%
increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to Board approval.
We will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Appreciate the continuity of the expense guide and also the potential variability.
Mike, I was just wondering if you could expand on that. Obviously, the operating losses are hanging higher this
year than they had been. So just wondering how you start to get a sense of what those look like going forward.
And then also, just the underlying, as you mentioned, coming in better because of revenue, just any sense of also
how your net saves are looking underneath the surface as well? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, hey, thanks, Ken. First, I'd start with the efficiency program that we've been talking about now for the better
part of the year-and-a-half. And all of that's tracking as we thought it would. So the core driving kind of efficiency
through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought. When you look at
what's happened this year, as you pointed out, operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the
beginning of the year. And those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of
items. You know the accounting standard we work with though, right? If we knew about something now, we would
accrue for it, and if we could estimate it, we would accrue for it. But we're just continuing to flag that we still had a
pipeline of stuff to work through.
And then as you highlighted, as we think about this year, the increases and the operating loss line have been
offset by – largely offset by the lower revenue-related expense. And so we still feel good about that $51.5 billion
number that we set out at the beginning of the year, and we're going to continue to work through the pipeline of
items. And if something is significant and possibly, we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah, and as a follow-up I know, as you guys talked to in recent conference season, it's hard to get a crystal ball
with so many moving parts as you think about 2023, but can you just help us try to at least start to think through
some of the pushes and takes? And can you continue to push us towards getting costs down next year? Thanks,
guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Ken, this is Charlie. Let me take that. The way we think about it as we sit and look towards next year, we
certainly know we have some increases to contend with, such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that
we see this year and we know we've got some increases in FDIC insurance premiums. But as we start thinking
about next year and we're really just starting the budget process, our mindset going into it is that we have
significant opportunities to become more efficient. We've been – and it's just more of the same in terms of what
we've been talking about. And this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the risk-related work. It
10

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
assumes that all of that investment continues, but we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to
see net expense reductions.
Now, just usual caveats that excludes revenue-related expenses, which could go up or some of the lumpiness
that we've talked about, just as we think – but as we think about that core expense base, we do continue to see
opportunities, and we'd like you to see it as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask about capital. It looks like you're entering now next quarter with over 100
basis points buffer to your pro forma reg minimums. How should we think about where you'll manage capital to
and your potential buyback capacity going forward? And given that you paused for SCB partly because of SCB
uncertainty, will you get to some level of buybacks likely moving forward here? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Hey, John, it's Charlie. Why don't I start, and then Mike can chime in. Yeah, I think you're – no question,
clarity of SCB for us at this point does really help. As we sit here today and we look at what's happening in
spreads and what's happening with the 10-year – what's at, 292 right now, we do want to be a little bit just
conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base. So just to be, I think, to be clear, as we sit
here today, we're very happy with the amount of capital that we have, including as we think about that 10 basis
points increase that will impact us. We certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point, and as, I think,
Mike alluded to, we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in
spreads and rates before we start to do that. But we certainly at point will do it. We'll just see exactly when that is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
And maybe I'll just add one or two things, John. I think, as Charlie highlighted, we feel good about where we are. I
would just point out, we are not, our GSIB score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well. So we
don't have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year, so that's good. And at this point, we don't feel
like we need to build capital from where we are, to build a bigger buffer. And then we'll just be prudent on
buybacks as we go through and through the next few quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And, Mike, maybe I can ask a follow-up on the NII revised outlook. What kind of cadence do you see
between the next two quarters? It seems like you'd have big step-ups both this coming quarter and the third
quarter and then again in the fourth. And then within that NII equation, you still have this funding gap between
loan growth being very strong and deposit growth slowing. Is there still plenty of cash to use to fund the loan
growth? Thank you.

Yeah, sure. I think ultimately the exact progression over the next couple quarters will be a function of how the Fed
moves on rates. But I would think of it as somewhat of a ratable step-up quarter-to-quarter. So not – you won't
see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go. And you'll continue to see a little bit of loan growth
come through. We think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year, but you'll
see loan growth there as well as it steps up. And as you say, I think the industry is seeing deposits come down a
little bit. If you look at the latest version of the Fed data, and you can see that in our results as well. Now for us it's
been a little bit – you can see the period-end balances in each of the segments, and it's been a little bit of a
reduction in each of them with the lowest percentage reduction being in the consumer space, So that's a good
thing. And then as you know, over the last couple of years, we've brought down much of our wholesale funding
that we've got out there, and so we've got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or to get the liquidity we need to
continue to support clients.

Steven Chubak Q

Hey, good morning. So wanted to start off with a question just clarifying some of the NII guidance. Mike, because
you noted that it's a ratable step-up and it's implying, the guidance implies about a $12 billion run-rate at least in
the back half for NII on an FTE basis, is it reasonable for us to assume or expect that the exit rate for the year is
going to be north of $50 billion? I just wanted to make sure to clarify that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, Steve, I know you're really good at modeling this stuff, so I'll let you do the modeling. But I think as you
pointed out, we're going to see step-ups, right, as we go through the next – as we did this quarter from last
quarter. And that'll continue into the third and fourth quarter. And now exactly what, it's hard to use one quarter,
as you know, to just run-rate for the following year, but certainly the exit rate's going to be a lot higher than even
where we are today. And then we'll have to just see what the environment is like at that point to know how to think
about whether that's a clean run-rate to build off of or if there are other things that get in the way.
And as you can see, over the last – even over the last three, four, five, six, weeks, whatever its been, the amount
of volatility that's out there on the long-end and what happens with loan growth, does it keep at the same pace,
and so there's a lot of factors, I think, that go into what 2023 would look like. But as you pointed out, our exit rate
will be pretty healthy.

Thanks for that, Mike. And just for one follow-up, also on the NII guide. Just wanted to get a better sense as to
what's being contemplated in terms of deposit beta. The deposit beta and repricing just came in much better than
beers this quarter. You've cited the benefits of the deposit and funding optimization you've executed these past
few years. Just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking about that deposit trajectory that's underpinning
some of the NII guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I mean, I think, that's – we're not expecting balances to grow much from where they are, and I think we'll
see what happens as if we see continued outflows of deposits. But as you pointed out, like our mix of deposits as
we came in this environment sets us up pretty well, and you can see that in results so far, where the consumer
deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pie than they were just a couple of years ago.
And as you sort of think about betas, so far, they've basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments,
and so we really haven't seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle. Now, if the Fed
does raise rates 75 basis points at the next meeting, now you're starting to get into territory that we didn't see at
the last rate cycle, rate rising cycle, and so we're going to start to see betas increase from there. And I think that's
exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the – and the
commercial side, we'll see and we're pretty nimble and are able to react to it. But so far, everything's progressed
as we thought it would, and so we're going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months and
I think that'll – this quarter and into the fourth quarter I think will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how
to think about it over a longer period of time.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just as it relates to revenues overall, so the NII trajectory
obviously quite strong and in a sense seems mostly self-evident for now. But I was hoping, Mike, you could
discuss, please, sort of the fee trajectory in a bit more detail. I guess we're kind of hovering in a $7 billion or $7.5
billion a quarter range if we exclude some of that noise from the equity marks, the securities gain, et cetera. In
your mind, are we sort of at a low? And can we grow from that base? I know you touched on mortgage maybe
coming down and then we've got wealth. But just sort of puts and takes as you see that if you could, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure, thanks, Scott. I'll just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of
the dynamics. Right? So on the deposit side, it's been pretty – we saw a step-down in the quarter, largely a result
of the changes we made in overdraft fees. We'll see a little bit more step-down as we go through the year,
probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing as we implemented the additional changes there.

But other than that, there's a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity. We'll see what
happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and asset-based fee line. It's going to be key
to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets, and as we bring – as more stability enters into
the market, that really supports that fee line, as you know, that's our single-biggest line item as you look at that
fees.
Investment banking, it's really going to be market-driven, but our fees were pretty low including the small mark
that we had in leverage finance. And so it's hard to see that going too much lower, but that really going to be
driven by the activity levels. Card spend, we're seeing still good, although it's slowed maybe a little in May and
June, we're still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are out spending so that's helpful.
Mortgage banking, as you highlighted, I think, is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter, but it's
off a much smaller base so you can still have decent size percentage declines there. But it's still really small
dollars at this point. And then we'll see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side,
but – so I think hopefully, we're getting more stability here, but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in
the markets.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. That's perfect. Thank you very much. And if I could just switch gears just a bit back to CCAR and the
SCB. I guess it's possible I had sort of misinterpreted your guys remarks over the last few quarters, but I sort of
felt like you guys were maybe prepping us for possibly a somewhat worse outcome in terms of where the SCB
would flush out. In your mind, how did that CCAR and that SCB – just because it barely budged, right? So how
did that all flush out relative to what you guys have kind of been anticipating?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, what we said a couple times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase, and it did.
Now, you have to keep in mind like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to
go up or down in any given year. Now there's a lot of stuff that's public, but there's also a lot of the modeling
techniques that aren't quite easy to understand. And so I would say we were pleased with the result, we've spent
– as many do probably, we spend a lot of time trying to understand the drivers of the risk of the balance sheet and
do our best to position ourselves for good outcomes. And so we were pleased [ph] that's working out (00:44:43).

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just on the deposit front, just to go back to that, I just want to confirm. So from here, your best estimate now is
that the overall deposit balances are relatively stable in the back half of the year. Or do you think you could see
some incremental declines just as betas are rising?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think you could certainly see a little bit more decline from here, potentially. I think that's not an unreasonable
expectation. Exactly timing and how that's going to progress I think is hard to predict with any real degree of
accuracy just given the environment we're in right now, but I think it's possible they come down a little bit more
from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, all right. Thanks, Mike. And then on the credit front, I want to get your thoughts on the likelihood of reserve
build. I know you added some reserve for loan growth this quarter. But in terms of an overall build of the reserve,
as you, from a CECL perspective, as you look at your economic scenarios, where do you see this quarter with
your CECL scenarios that didn't warrant a sizable build? And I guess longer-term, as this plays out and we see
the Fed continue with the tightening, what do you view as a potential level that you may have to bring the reserve
to? Is the pandemic level too high? And if you can help us with the magnitude there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, as you think about the process we go through, which I think is similar to most, in a lot of ways is you're really
looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And we've
now for a number of quarters in a row have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already. And
some of those scenarios are pretty severe, right? And so you've got weightings on what some might term mild
recessions, more severe recessions. You could create a lot of labels for them, but it's a number of scenarios that
have different severity of downside. And so we feel at this point that we've captured what we can look at and see
or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserve.
And I'll just point out also, if you look at us in the position we're in, yet we didn't take down all of the reserves that
we put up during COVID. And so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes, we feel what
we have today is appropriate. It's hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the
pandemic, but I think that's a hard thing to see at this point. But I think we'll have to make sure as things evolve
throughout the next couple quarters, we'll have to incorporate that. But again, we already have a pretty significant
weighting on those downside scenarios already, and it's a very, as you would imagine, a very robust conversation
that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it. And at this point, we feel it's appropriate for
what we can see over the life of those loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. And one more related to credit quickly. The $170 million write-down in unfunded leverage finance
commitments that you took, is there risk of future marks there? Is that primarily just predicated on market
spreads? And then separately, what is your – can you remind us, what's your total leverage loan exposure, both
in terms of commitments and outright outstandings? Thanks.

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, you got to think of these as unfunded commitments, not funded, right, so as you sort of think about them,
don't think about them outstanding. Think about them as unfunded commitments. That's number one. And you
really have to over time think about term loans versus high-yield a little bit differently. And on the high-yield side,
we don't disclose, we haven't disclosed the actual number, but it's really small in the scheme of the balance sheet
and the term loan side which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part. All
these deals are subject to further spread widening, given the environment we're in for sure. We at the end of the
quarter, took our best, used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear, and we'll see
how that goes over the coming months.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just had one more follow-up question. And, Mike, I apologize if this is the umpteenth question
on NII. Appreciate all your color in terms of what's driving the NII guide at 20%. I'm wondering if you could better
quantify the deposit beta that you would expect by year-end on a cumulative basis. Appreciate that you said it
would accelerate. But given that some of your peers have given specific guides and given how much the quality of
your deposit base has changed for the better over the past several years, I'm wondering if you could give us a
sense of what that beta range that you're assuming by year-end on a cumulative basis that underpins that guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, Erika, I think that's a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle, to be honest
with you. And if you think about – and it's just, there's so many moving pieces right now I think between – and
particularly as you sort of get to the year-end and the pace of rates and what exactly is the Fed going to do and
when are they going to do it. And so I think there's a lot that goes into that, that trying to get a one number is a
hard thing to say with a lot of confidence in my view.
I think what we can say, though, is as you look at the next couple rate rises, I think you're going to start to see
more acceleration. In the retail and the consumer side, the core deposit – the core rates haven't changed much
for the big banks at this point yet, so you'll start to see that happen over the next couple rate rises. The betas will
still be pretty small; however, that will start to pick up depending on how fast the Fed goes by year-end.
And then I think on the other side of the spectrum, on the corporate investment bank and those deposits, whether
it's in the FI space or the large corporate space, you're seeing those betas pick up a lot already, and so those will
continue to accelerate. And so when you look at cumulative betas, you really have to look at – and you start to
compare different banks – you're really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits. And the CIB deposits are
just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now. And those are going to – those will probably move faster
than even we've modeled, but it's a small piece of it. So I think we'll see how it goes and we'll give you as much
insight as we can, but I think trying to predict cumulative betas by year-end is hard.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just following up on that, Mike, so appreciate you don't want to get pinned down on deposit beta.
But is it fair for us to assume, just given the mix shift in deposits, given how you managed the balance sheet
during the pandemic, we should see your deposit beta at least track in-line or maybe even lower relative to the
last rate cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think as you think about each asset, each type of deposit, to date, they're tracking pretty close to what we
saw last cycle. But then you look at the mix of our deposit base and that's what's changed pretty substantially
since the last go-around. And so if betas stayed the same as last cycle by-product, given our mix has changed,
you would see a lower average deposit beta. But there's a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year, in
each of the underlying products.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's fair. Just wanted to make sure we weren't missing something because there are peers who probably are
expecting a higher beta than last cycle so just wanted to hear you talk through that. And as a follow-up – and I
know these are extremely tough in terms of when we think about the private market valuations on your equity
investments. But give us a sense of just where their markets are in terms of taking these markdowns. Should we
anticipate some more negative marks in a world where there's no big turnaround in equity markets over the next
few quarters? Just want to make sure like expectations are level set for that line and how that impacts fees and
PPNR.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure. Look – and again, it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets, which is in part
driving those declines. If we see some stabilization, that's constructive. If we see much deeper declines, that's –
we'll have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments. And obviously, if the market starts to rally,
that's even more constructive. So I think the public equity markets will be a good guide to how to think about
whether or not we have to evaluate whether there's more reductions here or not.

Thank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Mike, can you give us some color on – you guys had
some good success in the quarter in generating gains from your trading activities and your debt securities. Can
you just share with us what drove that and what your expectations might be in the next quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I mean, on the trading side, it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses,
commodities, FX, a little bit of rates. And so I think that's probably what contributed to it. And we'll see. Obviously,
the continued performance there is subject to what we see happening in the markets. We're not out there taking
any kind of incremental risk than we normally take. It's really helping clients facilitate the flow that they've got
there, and so we'll see how that goes. And as you can see it's a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe
some others. As you think about the securities portfolio, I wouldn't assume there will be continued gains there. I
think we did do some small remixing of our securities portfolio. Some of it was RWA. Some of it was RWA
optimization, I think selling some UMBS is buying Ginnies that, where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did
it. You save an RWA, you don't give up much yield, and there are a few other minor optimizations we did there.

numbers really have a kind of a meaningful downward move because you've resolved that issue?

bunch of technology work. It really cuts across a whole series of lines, and I just don't really think it's the right time
for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from and it's just genuinely not on our radar
screen in terms of what we're thinking about, where it's going to go or anything like that. So I'd rather just defer
the question at this point.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Charlie, I think you recently mentioned that you're in the process of strategically thinking about where mortgage
fits in. And I guess I wanted to understand what kind of framework you're assessing mortgage under, what you're
thinking about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. Yeah, and that was, by the way, not meant to be a new comment. That's something that we've been doing
ever since I got here, and we brought a new management including Kristy Fercho, who runs the business. I mean,
if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business, we were a hell of a lot bigger than we
are today. And so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do, how big we want to be,
both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on serving our own
customer base. And then to the extent that we have efficiencies, it makes sense for us to do other business.
But I guess my point was we're not interested being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the
sake of being in the mortgage business. We're in the home lending business because we think home lending is
an important product for us to talk to our customers about, and that'll ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it.
And so I would just, when you look at how much we're originating versus the size of our servicing business, the
servicing business over time will become smaller. And I think that's a smart and good thing for us for many
19

reasons and that, as I said, we're just going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where
we can make money over the cycles given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have, that
not necessarily everyone else have and make sure we're getting the right returns for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So is this a migration towards originate and retain and the mortgage servicing line goes away as an income
statement item because it becomes non-material? Or is there some middle ground that you're looking to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Oh, yeah. I mean, listen, we're still – I would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production
would be eligible for sale. And whether it's through the agencies or through the public market, that's all options
that we'd want to continue. And so we'll still be originating mortgages across the spectrum, some of which we'll
keep on balance sheet when it makes sense and others of which we'll sell, and we will have in MSR. Again, if you
just look at how much we originated historically versus what we're originating today, it'll naturally just come down
over time.

Yes.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Could you speak through rationale for that and what the wish list is for your new Head of Consumer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So Mike Weinbach, who had come into run our Home Lending businesses, put a whole series of things in
place, including if you look at the leadership across all our Card business, our Home Lending business, our
Personal Lending business, and our Auto business, all those, that's an entirely new management team plus new
heads of – I can go through all of the other functions as well. And Mike put that in place, and we talked about it,
and he wanted to do something different. And so we're lucky enough to have a gentleman named Kleber Santos,
who joined us a year-and-a-half to two years ago. Background was he was at Capital One prior to that and
McKenzie prior to that and Kleber and I have worked extremely close together. And just thrilled to have him in that
role. And so I think I wouldn't expect to see significant changes in the things that we've spoken about.
We're focused on continuing the product build-out on the credit card side, again focusing on customers that are
broader customers in the franchise, building our customer service around that and building out our digital
capabilities and all of the other parts of the business, which is work that we have underway. So I don't anticipate
any material changes from where we are, just but continued trends of the things that we've been talking about.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. And just then just lastly, on wealth. It's an important part of your offering. I'm wondering what you're doing
to strategically enhance that offering to your clients, be it either through product or how you're structured,
integration with consumer, your IT platform and solutions. Could you just give us a couple of bullet points on
what's going on there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure, let me start, Mike. Mike and I are both very involved in these conversations with Barry and his team. I think
if you look at our wealth business, its run entirely different today than it was several years ago. We had separate
platforms historically here between our brokerage business. We had two different private banks that operated
under two different brands. We had our bank channel and then completely separately, we had a digital platform,
and we had a platform for advisors that wanted to go independent. The digital platforms and the platform for
independent advisors had very little investment in it, and those were run – but all of those businesses, they were
run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology. And so what we've done is
we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to, and we've
combined the entire field under one leader, and we're investing in our digital capabilities, and we're investing in
the capabilities of those that want to go independent so if they want to do that they can stay here as opposed to
elsewhere.
We are building out capabilities across all the dimensions, from the investment capabilities to the banking
capabilities, our lending capabilities, offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didn't have access to those
in the past. And so it's a huge set of changes, which also bring with it a set of changes in the backend, which
we're going to – moving towards common platforms. And it's something we're really excited about, and we're just
at the beginning of seeing benefits of it. And I think it's one of the things that will make us appear to – for our
financial advisors to be an extremely attractive place to be, whether they want to be an employee and work for
Wells Fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And that change to moving to common platforms, what's the timing of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, it's not a technology move. I think he's talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we
operate the business. So it isn't dependent upon a big technology conversion, Betsy, so. And then I would just
highlight one last thing. Charlie, in his prepared remarks, talked about Wells Fargo Premier. That's step one in
really helping provide a more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer
business, and the wealth piece is going to be a big part of that. And we already have 1,500-plus advisors in the
branch system. We already have a great investments platform. And so we're in the early days, but building out a
differentiated service offering there as well, which will be a big part of the wealth business going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And that's in conjunction with consumer business?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, just to expand even further, Betsy. It's really a combination of the advisors and the products that Barry has
to offer in our wealth management business. It is also leveraging the lending products that Kleber is now
responsible for, including credit card and including mortgage and potentially auto and some other things there.
And an integrated offering with Mary's bank customers who are affluent. So it's an offering across all of our
product sets, directed in a much more segmented way than we've ever done in the past, and so we're extremely
excited about it and we'll be talking more about things that we're, capabilities that we're going to be rolling out
throughout the year.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

All right. Thank you.

Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Charlie, just wanted to follow-up on your question or your comment about loan
growth likely to moderate from the first half. Any color on that? What do you think drives that moderation? Which
categories?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Vivek. It's Mike. Maybe I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've just seen, I just don't think what we've seen in the
second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace. We may get surprised, and it'll be a little better than we
think, but I think at some point, we just feel as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other
factors that are causing clients to use their lines today, that just may moderate as we go through it. I wouldn't look
at it as some big warning of anything to come. It's just we're being a little, we're being a little prudent in terms of
the way we think about that growth rate. And maybe we'll be surprised in the upside a little, but it's just what we're
seeing right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So you're not seeing signs like sort of late in the quarter or anything already starting to show some slowdown or
some conversations with clients that are indicating that?

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Not that I would say are super significant at this point. But you can go category by category and say, okay, well
spending in the card space continues to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic
environment. We'll see. Maybe. Commercial Real Estate, certainly given what we're seeing in the real estate
market there, that appears like it'll slow down a little bit as we get in the second half of the year, somewhat driven
by what we're seeing in the capital markets side of the business as well. And so with a slowdown in deals
happening and rates rising, that just is a natural slowdown there. And so I just think you go asset class by asset
class. It just feels as though we'll see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And a minor one, Mike, for you. The hung loan loss number that you gave us, was it a gross mark or was it
net of fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
The leverage finance one, Vivek?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
That's after fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's after fees. Okay. So then what's the gross mark on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I don't have the exact number in front of me. It's not materially different.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2022
Hi. I was wondering if you could remind us the targeted customer within credit card as you lean into that business.
And do you think about maybe slowing from the expansion plans there, just given all the recession talk and fears?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, this is Charlie, Matt. First off, our targeted customers, those that we want to have a broader relationship
with, what we have said is that as we've rolled out this new product set, when you look at the credit quality of the
borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards to, the credit quality is actually stronger than
it had been historically. And it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled
the products out. It's just, we're not competing on credit terms. We're not competing in any way, shape, or form in
terms of that. We just want to have a quality offering, and we would expect it to be a high-quality card customer
that we can do other things with across our franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And just any disclosure on FICO score in terms of the overall portfolio or the customer that you're growing or
leaning into?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I think you can get some of that in the queue, Matt. You have to go a little deep into the queue, but you can
get some of that in the distribution tables in the queue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. I'll look further, thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Campbell
Director-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.
All righty everyone, thank you very much. We appreciate everything, and we look forward to talking to you all.
Take care.
