Good morning. We're pleased to be with you today to share details about our strong third quarter performance.
The strength of our franchise remains evident in the results outlined on slide 4. This quarter was like our last,
business as usual for Old National with growth in deposits, well-controlled funding cost, ample liquidity, and stable
credit quality. We also saw slightly positive loan growth despite loan sales. We reported an EPS of $0.49 for the

quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.51 per common share with adjusted ROA and ROATCE of 1.26% and 21%
respectively. Importantly, we achieved significant year-over-year tangible book value growth.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio remained under 50%. Total and core deposit balances were up 3% during the
quarter as we compete effectively for new deposits. Our total cost of deposits was 161 basis points, and we
maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low 30% total deposit beta cycle to-date. As a result, we beat our
own margin expectations.
Our credit quality remained stable. Net charge-offs were 24 basis points, 15 basis points of which related to a
single charge-off that we don't believe indicates a broader weakness in the portfolio. We remain diligent in
managing the portfolio, consistent with our past strong credit management practices.
On the new business side, while our loan pipeline has declined, we continue to actively seek and win new loan
business where we can develop core relationships, meet hurdle rate returns, and have a strong credit profile.
Broadly, some competitors have seen significant appetite change, creating new opportunities for us. As a result,
we expect the loan portfolio to grow modestly for the remainder of the year. We also continue to hire top revenue-
generating talent selectively, albeit slower than previous quarters.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendon to cover the quarter results in more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jim. Turning to our quarter end balance sheet on slide 5. We continue to effectively navigate this
challenging operating environment. Our focus on deposit acquisitions resulted in 3% growth this quarter and has
led to a better funding mix, stronger than expected net interest income, and will allow us to take advantage of new
lending opportunities while many of our peers are pulling back. Our strong earnings improved all regulatory capital
ratios, and our tangible book value per share increased 3%, excluding the AOCI impact.
On slide 6, we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew in line with our
expectations. We sold $389 million of non-relationship C&I loans at par during the quarter as we look to manage
liquidity while prioritizing lending to our clients with full banking relationships. Excluding these loan sales, total
loans increased 1.7%. The invest portfolio declined in line with our expectations, and the duration remained
steady at 4.3. Cash flows from the portfolio are expected to be $1.4 billion over the next 12 months.
Moving to slide 7, we show our trend in total deposits, which increased $1 billion, including approximately $300
million of normal seasonal public fund inflows. All three of our lines of business posted solid growth and client
acquisition. Growth came mostly from the money market and time deposit categories, offset by declines in
noninterest-bearing deposits, which continue to experience migration to higher yielding products. Noninterest-
bearing deposits as a percent of total deposits was 28% at quarter end, and we anticipate this downward trend to
continue in the near term, albeit at a slower pace.
Market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates with interest-bearing deposit costs up 56
basis points to 2.22%. Total deposit costs were 1.61% for the quarter, which equates to a cycle-to-date total
deposit beta of a very low 30%. While it's challenging to estimate the terminal beta, we have a strong history of
managing deposit rates and are confident we can maintain our cost advantage through the remainder of the rate
cycle. Our deposit promotions have been highly successful at bringing in new clients and we are actively working
to deepen and expand those relationships.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Slide 8 provides our quarter end income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common shares
of $144 million or $0.49 per share. Reported earnings include $6 million in pre-tax merger-related charges.
Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.51. Our profitability continues to be strong with an
adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 20.9%, and adjusted return on average assets of 1.26%.
Moving on to slide 9, we present details of our net interest income and margin. As expected, deposit pricing led to
modest declines in both NII and NIM. We anticipate approximately $3.4 billion in fixed rate loans to be repriced
over the next 12 months; and reinvestment rate, approximately 260 basis points better than runoff yields. This
should provide a considerable offset to late cycle deposit repricing.
Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $81 million for the quarter. All of our primary fee
businesses performed as expected with a slight seasonal uptick in mortgage revenue.
Continuing to slide 11, we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusted expenses were $239
million, and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low of 49.7%. These results were generally in line with our Q2
guidance.
On slide 12, we present our credit trends, which remained stable, reflecting the quality of both our commercial and
consumer portfolios. Delinquencies and nonperforming loan trends were both within our normalized range. Net
charge-offs were 24 basis points, with 15 basis points related to a single long-term C&I client that suffered
operational challenges following a generational management succession.
Our third quarter allowance, including reserve for unfunded commitments, stands at $337 million or 103 basis
points of total loans, and was largely unchanged from the prior quarter. Our reserve model assumptions already
reflect a material slowdown in the economy, consistent with the Moody's S3 Scenario, which should limit reserve
build to portfolio performance and loan growth.
Shifting to key areas of focus on slide 14, you will see further details of our loan portfolio. We have no material
change in our office portfolio with less than 1% of total outstanding located in the central business districts. Our
shared national credit portfolio is 7% of our total portfolio, has above-average credit quality, and continues to
perform well. We did have some limited exposure to mandated regulatory downgrades this quarter, which
accounted for half of our credit migration. That said, as part of our ongoing portfolio management, we were able to
exit one of these credits at par, shortly following the forced downgrade announcement.
On slide 15, we provide highlights from a recent examination of fixed rate CRE maturities over the next 18
months. We continue to believe, given the small exposure and current performance, that the refinance risk in this
portfolio will be minimal.
Slide 16 details our Q3 commercial production. Our slightly lower production and pipeline this quarter reflect
moderating client demand and our focus on obtaining full banking relationships with new loan requests.
On slide 17, we present further insights into our franchise leading deposit base, which is exceptionally granular
and long-tenured. Please note, we reduced our broker deposit exposure this quarter, which stands at only 3.2% of
total deposits compared to the industry average of 10.6% last quarter.
On slide 18, we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter. We observed
improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and a modest decline in our TCE ratio, which was driven by rate-
related increases in AOCI. Our above peer return on tangible common equity coupled, with our peer average

dividend payout ratio, should result in ONB accreting capital at a faster rate than most. Additionally, we anticipate
30% of our outstanding AOCI to accrete to capital by the end of 2024.
In summary, our strong third quarter performance exceeded our expectations. We have improved the efficiency of
our balance sheet with strong core deposit growth, which has led to a better funding mix and better-than-expected
net interest income. We continue to demonstrate our ability to expand our customer base while maintaining peer-
leading deposit costs. Our strong liquidity also positions us well to take advantage of new lending opportunities.
Our credit portfolio remains stable, and our disciplined approach to managing expenses is evident in our quarterly
adjusted efficiency ratio of 49.7%.
Slide 20 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We believe our current pipeline should
support fourth quarter growth in the low single-digit range. We anticipate continued success in our execution of
our deposit strategy and expect to meet or exceed the industry growth in the fourth quarter. We're expecting a 3%
to 4% decline in NII in Q4, which equates to a 13% year-over-year increase, a slight upward revision from our Q2
guide than anticipated 12% year-over-year growth. This updated guidance assumes no additional [ph] Fed
(00:11:11) actions, a through-the-cycle interest-bearing deposit beta of 46% by year-end, and noninterest-bearing
deposits falling to 26%.
We expect fee businesses to be stable with typical seasonal patterns. Longer term, we remain bullish on both TM
and wealth as our investments in these areas build momentum. Our expense outlook for the fourth quarter should
be consistent with Q3, excluding merger-related charges with some potential variability related to incentive
accruals. Provision expense should continue to be limited to loan growth, portfolio change, and non-PCD charge-
offs as we believe we have adequate reserves against the PCD book.
Turning to taxes, we expect approximately $5 million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of 2023, with a
corresponding full year effective tax rate of 25% on a core FTE basis and 23% on a GAAP basis.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. We do have the full team available, including
Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren, and John Moran.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper
Sandler. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for taking the question. Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Scott. Sorry for the delay, and I'm glad you're back on top.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Oh, no problem. Me, too. Thank you. Let's see. I was hoping to start on the deposit side. Maybe just some
expanded thoughts on the way you are sort of thinking about the balance between growth and rate or cost on the
deposit side. So, you accelerated total deposit cost – total deposit growth, which was great, but in some higher
cost areas. So, just maybe kind of philosophically, how were you thinking about things through the third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We think there's opportunities to continue to lend and building some dry powder through deposit growth.
Makes a lot of sense to us at the rates we're able to do it. You think about growing deposits at a low 4% handle
and be able to lend that out in mid- to high-7s, I think, gives you a marginal margin that is a quality risk-adjusted
return. So, that's the thought process. So, as long as we can continue to raise deposit at those levels and have
lending opportunities in those high-7s, we'll continue to do that.

And as we raise a lot of deposits, Scott, through money markets, a good chunk of that is new clients to the bank.
And so we think there's opportunities to expand those relationships over time. So, I think it's a – and we have
room to do that, to raise some market competitive deposits right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfectly – or perfect. And then I know you talked about the nearly $3.5 billion in fixed rate loans that would
sort of reprice over – or recast over the next 12 months. Do you think that will be allow – or will be enough to allow
the margin to trough in the next quarter or two if the Fed finishes its tightening cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Scott, I think it's still too early to tell. I can tell you that it does provide a lot of offset to late-cycle deposit [ph]
repricing (00:16:03). If it's going to be enough, hard to say, but it's a meaningful amount. And then you couple that
with the $1.4 billion of cash flows from the invest portfolio, that's a meaningful offset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.

Good morning, Terry.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe I just had a question on capital, CET1, up to 10.4%; TCE, 6.2% . So, can you discuss any near-term
capital targets, given what you call market conditions here in the presentation? And essentially, what would you
need to see to begin repurchasing stock again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No – Terry, this is Brendon. No capital targets now. Not thinking about turning on our share repurchase and no
dividend actions considered at this time. We'll continue to kind of run the play and grow capital.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And a question for Jim. Could you just expand on the 2024 growth strategy that's right in the beginning of
the press release? Maybe best markets to build share, opportunistic hiring? And then how does that play into your
expense management for next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, great question. I think it's more business as usual than not. We continue to find great opportunities
to hire folks selectively. That pace has slowed down a little bit. We're not really considering any kind of new
markets in terms of hiring commercial relationship talent or wealth management talent. They may come along,
and we certainly see a fair number of those opportunities. But I think it's more business as usual for us and [ph]
continue (00:17:50) to really execute on the teams and the folks we've already hired. And then I think there's still
opportunities within our existing footprint to continue to add selectively in our key markets.
So, I would say it's more business as usual. We're sensitive to obviously the demand on the expense base, and
we'll continue to look for ways to be judicious in how we manage our expenses going forward, hopefully to offset
any incremental cost from those new hires.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And I'll squeeze one in. Brendon, any thoughts on expense growth for next year? Any targets in mind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No specific targets. Like, I just take care that we have a good track record of making sure our expense base does
not grow much beyond sort of a typical merit increase. And we have some levers there to pull. But as Jim said, it's
not going to stop us from investing in ourselves, but we got to find ways to pay for that.

Good morning, Jon. Good to hear from you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thank you. Brendon, just one for you, back on Scott's question. Your NII guide suggests a pretty big step-
down in the fourth quarter in the margin. Can you just help us understand a little bit more some of the puts and
takes there in terms of what's going on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Largely that kind of 3% to 4% decline in Q4 is almost entirely deposit cost related. Again, we're not getting
a lot of help on the asset beta side at this point other than the fixed rate repricing. But the question on the NII side
is, can we continue to try and grow through that and help bolster NII? And that's the game plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. And then I guess on slide 17, you talk about the exception pricing on deposits. How is that
trending? Is that intensifying or easing off at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Not intensify. We're still less than 30% of our book at the exception price or promotional related. And, again, those
are in the very low 4%, and so we feel really good about that marginal funding opportunity that we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. The loan sale, I think I understand it, but was that the SNC that you talked about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
One of them was [ph] sheared and scrapped (00:20:21); and the rest, out of the – at the capital markets book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
But you're talking – the – it was out of our capital markets book, which was a transactional book that we had used
to soak up excess liquidity over time. And so all of the loan sales of the $400 million came out of that book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. More to come on that or not?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
At a lesser pace. If there is additional, it'll be at a lesser pace than that in the next couple quarters, I would say.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. And then you kind of touched on it, Jim, with Terry's question. But the pipeline change, it feels
like maybe the market is slowing down, but you're seeing better opportunities. But can you just maybe touch on
some of the elements of the pipeline change? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think the pipeline change is reflective of what's going on in the economy more broadly, as well as our selectivity
that Jim alluded to. There's certainly less CRE activity overall in the marketplace clearly. And even C&I is a little
bit – we're projecting a little slower growth over the next couple quarters than we saw the quarters before as an
industry. We think we're still well-positioned to outgrow the industry. We think industry growth is going to be a little
more muted going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I do think we've seen a significant appetite change out of some of our regional competitors, and that is
creating new opportunities. We're with a client last night. It would fall into that camp. And I think that's going to
create nice opportunities for us, both on our ability to get the right credit profile picture, full relationships and full
pricing. So, those are our expectations. We are definitely open for business. We're still on the offense and still
believe we've got room to continue to grow here.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Jim or Mark, the comment about the forced downgrades of the certain relationships, maybe a little bit more color
there. I presume that's the shared national credit book, but just a little bit of color on the regulatory guidelines you
talked about. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
As Brendon alluded to, about half of our downgrades this quarter came from the SNC review, all credits of which
we feel good about. And as Brendon alluded to, we already sold one. Frankly, I think we'll sell another one this
quarter at par. So, I – we feel good about all those credits, and yet a little downgraded as a result of the exam.
Other than that, you saw a little bit of risk migration, but no concentrations, no – nothing to point to, just kind of
reflective of what's going on in the broader economy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just, Brendon, on the balance sheet, you obviously have the ability to bring down
borrowings. Not a lot on the books. But anything you're considering in terms of retooling the balance sheet into
next year with the securities portfolio or plans to kind of reduce that? You talked about the $1.4 billion, the 12
months cash flows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. No major restructurings plan on the invest portfolio, but we'll continue to manage that portfolio appropriately
and take appropriate action there. But no major restructuring plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe the last one. A lot of questions this quarter for the industry about the trough in
revenues, net interest income. How are you thinking – and without providing 2024 full year, how are you thinking
about just the cadence of the NII for the next several quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. As we talked about, so I think there's the 3% to 4% step-down. And then largely, I think this becomes sort of
the [ph] fight for flat (00:24:18) that we've kind of been talking about. I think that'll – that's how we're going to be
thinking about 2024. And if we get some rate cuts in the back half [indiscernible] (00:24:28) actually plays out, I
think that's where you start to see some upside.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. Thank you.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan, III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. I just wanted to ask a question. It's a little bit in the weeds, but just the $3.4 billion of the fixed rate loan
repricing over the next 12 months, it doesn't quite [ph] fit (00:25:00) like the call report bucket, I guess, like as I
would have expected maybe in the 3- to 12-month. So, I guess I wanted to ask kind of what's driving that
difference? And then also, is there any kind of lumpiness to that $3.4 billion? Or is it fairly evenly distributed?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Fairly evenly distributed. This is coming right out of our asset/liability management system, which would obviously
include some prepay speed assumptions in there, which is probably the biggest piece of what you'd see from a
regulatory report versus what we're sharing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And I appreciated the additional SNC disclosure on slide 14. I did want to ask though,
if you could give us any color. I know it's a small book for you, but was there anything specific that drove the
downgrades from the SNC review? Like, was it debt service coverage related? Like, just looking for a little bit of
color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
It was principally debt service coverage-related. It was a half dozen credits across with no concentration in
industry, Brody. So – and, again, looked at off of 2022 numbers, so I think there's a – there's more to come as
2023 plays out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. No. That's extremely helpful. I also wanted to ask – I saw the tidbit on the maturing CRE loans and
the sub-loans underwritten at 300 basis points over the current market rate. And so I just wanted to clarify, I think
on your previous slides, you said you're originating stuff in the 7% to 7.70% range or something like that. Does
that mean that you underwrote those loans that are coming due at – the ability to perform at a 10% interest rate?
Am I understanding that correctly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, Brody, what – that note means 300 basis points above the rate at the time of origination. So, if you
have [indiscernible] (00:27:11)...

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
... at the time of origination, those are underwritten at 7%, which, again, helps give us confidence, given the
current market rates. Most of those will have the ability to cash flow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's very helpful. And then the – excuse me. On the deposit slide, that 25% of total deposits are
exception and special pricing with a weighted average rate of 4.17%. How would you expect those deposits – the
beta on those deposits to be if rate cuts did happen in the back half of 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We have the opportunity to reprice a lot of those in a hurry. Some of them are fully indexed. Many of them
are related to [indiscernible] (00:28:00) rates that will reset early back and middle of next year. There will be
opportunity to bring those down in a hurry if we get rate cuts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And then just one follow-up on the SNC review, and I guess it's – I'm not as familiar
with the process. That's for each individual bank, right? So, for – so different banks go through that at different
points in the year. Is that accurate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. No. So, it's done...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
...across universally. They're reviewed at the agent bank. And then the other participants in those credit facilities
have to adjust the rates at the time that it's issued to the agent bank. But it's all done at once.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
