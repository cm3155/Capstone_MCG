Andrew M. Young
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the first quarter,
Capital One earned $1.3 billion or $3.13 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a
$42 million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the FDIC special assessment.
Net of this adjusting item, first quarter earnings per share were $3.21. Relative to the prior quarter, period-end
loans held for investment decreased 2% and period-end deposits increased 1%. Both average loans and average
deposits were flat.
Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits remained at 82% of total deposits. Pre-provision earnings in the first
quarter increased 13% from the fourth quarter or 6% adjusting for the impacts of FDIC special assessments in
both quarters.
Revenue in the linked quarter declined 1%, largely driven by lower non-interest income. Non-interest expense
decreased 6% on an adjusted basis, driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses.
Our provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior
quarter. The decrease was driven by $257 million lower net reserve build, partially offset by an $83 million
increase in net charge-offs.
Turning to slide 4, I will cover the allowance in greater detail. We built $91 million in allowance this quarter,
bringing the balance to $15.4 billion, an increase of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in
allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our Auto and Domestic Card portfolios.
Our total portfolio coverage ratio increased 11 basis points to 4.88%. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in
allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide 5. Our baseline economic forecast modestly improved this
quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter, which generally aligns with consensus. We continue to
consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process.
In our Domestic Card business, the allowance coverage ratio increased by 22 basis points to 7.85%. The
increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarter's seasonal
outstandings.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance increased by $46 million, resulting in a 7 basis point increase
to the coverage ratio. The allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the auto
finance business. And finally, our Commercial Banking allowance decreased by $7 million, primarily driven by
portfolio contraction. Coverage ratio increased by 1 basis point to 1.72%.
Turning to page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to $127 billion, about
$7 billion higher than last quarter. Our cash position ended the quarter at approximately $51 billion, up about $8
billion from the prior quarter.
The increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the
seasonality of our card balances. Our average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and
well above regulatory minimums at 164%.
Turning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our first quarter net interest margin was 6.69%, 4 basis points
lower than last quarter and 9 basis points higher than the year ago quarter.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NIM was largely driven by the impact of having one fewer day in the quarter.
Modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter.
Turning to slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the
quarter at 13.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Strong earnings and lower risk-
weighted assets more than offset the impact of CECL phase-in, dividends and share repurchases.
We repurchased approximately $100 million of shares in the first quarter. Our repurchase activity in the quarter
was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the
Discover transaction.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. Slide 10 shows first quarter results in our Credit Card business.
Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on
slide 11. Top line growth trends in the Domestic Card business remained strong in the first quarter. Year-over-
year purchase volume growth for the first quarter was 6%. Ending loan balances increased $12.9 billion or about
10% year-over-year. Average loans increased 11%, and first quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year, driven
by the growth in purchase volume and loans.
The charge-off rate for the quarter was up 190 basis points year-over-year to 5.94%, about 18% above its pre-
pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 82 basis points
from the prior year to 4.48%. On a sequential quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 59 basis points, and the
30-plus delinquency rate was down 13 basis points.
The linked-quarter delinquency and charge-off rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from
normal seasonality. We believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far
in 2024, relative to what we've historically observed. Tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality.
Each year, they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in February.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Our portfolio trends generally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average. Last quarter,
our view was that the charge-off rate was settling out about 15% above 2019 levels in the near term. That was
based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over three to six months, and that was the
horizon of our estimate.
If the trend of lower tax refunds sustains, it could raise the level of charge-off somewhat in the near term but this
does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre pandemic levels in 2018 and 2019. The
continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends sometimes referred to as the improving second
derivative supports our view. The pace of year-over-year increases in both the charge-off rate and the
delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the first quarter.
Domestic Card non-interest expense was up 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with increases in both
operating expense and marketing expense. Total company marketing expense of about $1 billion for the quarter
was up 13% year-over-year. Total company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our Domestic Card
and Consumer Banking businesses, and builds and leverages the value of our brand. Our choices in Domestic
Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing. We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our
Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation.
Our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the Domestic Card business. And in the
first quarter, Domestic Card marketing also included higher early spend bonuses driven by strong new account
growth, higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements, like our travel portal, airport
lounges and Capital One Shopping. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our
Domestic Card franchise. As always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace
risks.
Slide 12 shows first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter, auto originations
increased 21% from the prior year quarter, a return to growth after several quarters of year-over-year declines.
Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $3.1 billion or 4% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis,
ending loans were essentially flat.
We posted another quarter of year-over-year growth in consumer deposits. First quarter ending deposits in the
consumer bank were up just under $10 billion or 3% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending
deposits were up about 2%. Average deposits were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the sequential quarter.
Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy
continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth.
Consumer Banking revenue for the quarter was down about 13% year-over-year, largely driven by lower auto
loan balances and higher deposit costs. Non-interest expense was down about 3% compared to the first quarter
of 2023. Lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital
bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.99%, up 46 basis points year-over-year. The 30+
delinquency rate was 5.28%, up 28 basis points year-over-year.
Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 20 basis points, while the 30+ delinquency rate was
down 106 basis points. The linked-quarter charge-off rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical
seasonal patterns we've historically observed, driven by the tax refund trends I just discussed. Even with the tax
refund effects, auto credit performance remains strong.

Slide 13 shows first quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending
loan balances decreased about 1%. Average loans were also down about 1%. The modest declines are largely
the result of choices we made in 2023 to tighten credit. Ending deposits were down about 5% from the linked
quarter. Average deposits were down about 8%. The declines are largely driven by our continued choices to
manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances.
First quarter revenue was up 2% from the linked quarter. Non-interest expense was up about 6%.
The Commercial Banking annualized net charge-off rate for the first quarter decreased 40 basis points from the
sequential fourth quarter to 0.13%. The Commercial Banking criticized performing loan rate was 8.39%, down 42
basis points compared to the linked quarter. The criticized non-performing loan rate increased 44 basis points to
1.28%. Commercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio, which is less
than 1% of total company loan balances.
In closing, we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter. We posted another quarter of top line growth
in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans. Domestic Card credit trends continue to stabilize and
auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We grew consumer deposits and we
added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet.
Over the last decade, we've driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as we've invested to
transform our technology, and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time. For the full year 2024,
we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared
to 2023. Our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed CFPB late fee rule, assuming the rule
takes effect in October 2024. The timing of the new rule remains uncertain. If the rule were to take effect at an
earlier date, it would be a headwind to the 2024 operating efficiency ratio.
Of course, the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Discover. We've submitted our applications for regulatory approval, and we're fully mobilized to plan and
deliver a successful integration.
The combination of Capital One and Discover creates game changing strategic opportunities. The Discover
payments network positions Capital One as a more diversified, vertically integrated global payments platform, and
adding Capital One's debit spending and a growing portion of our Credit Card purchase volume to the Discover
network will add significant scale, increasing the network's value to merchants, small businesses and consumers,
and driving enhanced network growth.
In the Credit Card business, we're bringing together two proven franchises with complementary strategies and a
shared focus on the customer. And we can accelerate the growth of our national digital-first consumer banking
business by adding the Discover consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debit
network.
We will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11-year technology transformation across every
business and the network, which will serve as the catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk
management and compliance, underwriting, marketing and customer service, pulling way up the acquisition of
Discover as a singular opportunity. It will create a Consumer Banking and global payments platform with unique
capabilities, modern technology, powerful brands and a franchise of more than 100 million customers. It delivers
compelling financial results and it offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers, and
an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term.

Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.

Hey, Ryan.

Good evening, Ryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So Rich, maybe to just start off on credit. It sounds like you're running a little bit ahead of what you had outlined in
the last quarter. But when you put aside the timing of tax refund, can you maybe just talk about what you're
seeing from the consumer? And do you think we've now reached the inflection where we can more closely follow
seasonal patterns? And once the noise settles, do you think we're kind of back at that 15% level that you had
outlined? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thank you, Ryan. Look, I think that the story continues to be one of â€“ well, in terms of â€“ there's sort of the
consumer itself. Let's just talk about the consumer for a second and then let's talk about Capital One's credit
performance, but just the health of the consumer. I think, the US consumer remains a source of strength in the
economy. The labor market remains strikingly resilient. Rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing
burdens relatively low by historical standards. And when we look at our customers, we see that they have higher
bank balances than before the pandemic, and this is true across income levels. On the other hand, of course,
inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years. And in this high interest rate environment, the cost of new
7

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
borrowing has gone up in every major asset class. And I think at the margin, these effects stretch some
consumers financially.
So â€“ but on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative â€“ pretty darn strong shape
relative to historical benchmarks. So in terms of Capital One's performance, we continue to see a settling out. We
consider â€“ we believe that for Capital One, I can't speak for all card issuers, but we definitely have seen what we
think is sort of a landing. And our â€“ so we feel very good about where the credit is.
The point that I wanted to make about the tax refunds, let's just pull up for a second on that. The tax refunds are
something that nobody knows for sure exactly what's behind seasonality, but I think it's a â€“ we believe, a very
important driver of seasonality. It's a bigger effect for us than other players because I think cash refunds just play
a little bit bigger role in â€“ collectively across our customer base. So the tax refunds in the very near-term effect
credit performance, Ryan, what you're referring to the 15% guidance that we gave, that was not an annual
guidance number that was saying, if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of
delinquencies and delinquency roll rates. That's where we would see charge-offs, and charge-offs tend to be
higher in the first half of the year. So what we're doing is giving a window to the higher part of charge-offs for the
year, and we were saying they were settling out looked like around 15% above 2019 levels. Part of that â€“ and so
basically, what I'm saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the
seasonality effect.
As we can see in the government data, tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns. And so that
affects our near-term credit performance. And actually, we often talk about, well, isn't the six-month window
basically once charge-offs start bubbling and going through the roll rate buckets we can pretty much see where
charge-offs are going.
Tax refunds actually affect the payment rate in every bucket. So our point was in the very near term, it actually
leads to a bit of a higher charge-off rate than we had guided to over that near window. But that doesn't change our
view that credit has settled out, but the 15% was not a guidance for the year. We haven't really given credit
guidance for the year.
What we're really saying is we have seen credit settle out, but we wanted to just flag that both in the Credit Card
business and in our auto business, while credit continues to be very strong, and you've seen things like really
improving delinquencies, we just wanted to point out that in the very near term, relative to what we have seen in
terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds, there is â€“
it's coming in lower and later. And we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very near-term numbers
that we cited earlier.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe as my quick follow-up for Andrew. I guess, given Rich's answer, what does that mean for the
trajectory of the allowance? It seems like we've heard a handful of other issuers talk about us being at the peak or
maybe even coming down and potentially being below where it ended the prior year. Can you maybe just talk
about what you think this means for Capital One, given your credit expectations?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Yeah. Sure, Ryan. I'd like to say from my perspective that there's a simple answer, but there's not. And then
there's a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here, not the least of which is growth, but just
focusing on coverage and assuming that's what others are pointing to.
The first thing I'd highlight â€“ and I said in my talking points that fourth quarter had seasonal balances, they quickly
pay off in the first quarter and therefore, have negligible coverage, which we see every year. So the coverage
ratio this quarter, up a bit from last quarter is really a result of that dynamic. But if you look at coverage ratio now,
it's largely in line with the preceding quarters, I mean, the biggest driver as we look ahead, are the projected loss
rates. And as we've been saying for a number of quarters, delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that.
And so every quarter, we're going to look out over the next 12 months and then the reversion from there. And
we're going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties. And so you've seen over the last few
quarters, keeping the coverage ratio flat.
I will note, though, even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might
indicate a release otherwise. You could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines
as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance. And so eventually, the projected
losses will â€“ when they're lower will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those
uncertainties become more certain. And under that scenario, you would see a decline. But at this point, I'm not
going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because, like I said, we
really need to take the factor of uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving
process.

America. You may proceed.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Rich, if I could switch for a second to the Discover acquisition. There's been a lot of talk around
deal approval, particularly focusing around potential antitrust issues within the card business. And I was
wondering if you could share your thoughts and perspective on that issue if you've heard anything from
regulators, but also just to hear how you are thinking about that issue? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Thank you, Mihir. So we have filed our merger applications with both the Fed and the OCC, and we are
engaged with the â€“ sorry, with the DOJ as they, of course, play a key role in advising the Fed and the OCC on
competition questions. We believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval. We believe
strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks, credit card issuers and payment networks and
provide significant benefits for consumers, merchants and the communities that we serve. While some have
raised concerns about competition, we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling.
On the network side, let's remember that we're not currently in that business. If the deal is approved, we will still
have four networks just like we do today, but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of

the four networks and be able to leverage our technology, talent and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance
Discover's competitive viability. Their market share was 6% a decade ago and sits at just 4% today. The
significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants as
we've outlined in our regulatory applications.
On the Credit Card side, the regulators have found every time they've studied it that the credit card market is
highly competitive and not at all concentrated. In fact, it's less concentrated today than it was 10 years ago.
Consumers can choose from over 4,000 issuers, all able to offer products with similar capabilities.
Imagine this, a card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like
Capital One can be used, anywhere in the world, that kind of level playing field doesn't exist in any other industry
and certainly not in airlines or grocery stores or many of the others.
There's a reason that we ask folks what's in your wallet. We compete not only with these 4,000 other issuers to
gain your business in the first place but also, with every other card you likely already own. Put another way, we
have to compete every day for every single transaction, because our customers can simply choose at any
moment to use another card. And if they don't like the card they have, they can stop using it entirely or close the
account or switch to another card with another bank, large or small, in minutes.
We also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business as thousands
of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate. New and incumbent fintechs backed by
significant VC funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like
Marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth. Also, any existing bank can choose where in the credit
spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy.
Let's also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely, cash, debit or buy now
pay later, which has exploded onto the marketplace. New fintechs are entering the payments in small dollar credit
space every day all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like Capital One. We faced
this competition for years, and we'll continue to face it in the future. It's powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely
competitive marketplace. But we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering
credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry.
We're the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees, no minimums and no overdraft
fees. So pulling way up, we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both pro-competitive and pro
consumer, bringing our best-in-class products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses
and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants. In the end, that is what we believe the regulators
will use their very vigorous process to evaluate.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you. That is helpful. Just turning back to the health of the consumer for a second for my follow-up,
if you could just talk a little bit about the environment for card acquisitions. You did mention, I think, that the
growth opportunity â€“ you see good growth opportunities in the card business. So, wondering if you could expand
on that. Maybe talk about just some of the puts and takes as you consider where to make those investments? Are
there parts of the market where you're being more cautious, given the environment? Thank you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Mihir, we are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business, powered by a healthy consumer and
the traction that we're getting in our business. We are â€“ really, all parts of the card business are seeing very nice
account originations, seeing good traction on the purchase volume side. And so, it's very much a positive time for
leaning in, as you see reflected in our marketing, as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers, and as I
see in numbers behind the numbers that you see, just a lot of traction.
And just â€“ let's just savor, for a second, some of the things that are powering that; two things that I would flag is:
one, the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market. And I think that not only affects
our success at the top of the market, but I really believe there's a lifting of all boats from those investments and
that traction there.
Also, we continue to just get a â€“ have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation, including not
only the customer experience and some of the product capabilities that we're able to offer, but really impacts on
the whole way that we run the business and, very notably, on the credit and marketing side of the business. The
ability to create mass customized offerings and real-time solutions just enables us to have more traction on the
growth side.
Also, I just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the auto business and, also, we
continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions, this afternoon. Hey, Rich, I want to make sure I fully understand what you're
describing in terms of credit. The framework is that charge-off rates will be about 15% higher than 2018, 2019
levels in the near term. But now, with tax refunds, it might be a little bit higher than that, that over time, it will
converge back towards slightly above 2018, 2019 levels. When I look at the delinquencies â€“ and one of the things
we've observed is that roll from delinquency to charge-off is actually higher than it has been pretty much at any
time in recent history. Does that suggest that delinquencies actually need to get back below 2018, 2019 levels to
achieve that level of charge-off performance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
So, Rick, there's a lot. First of all, let me clarify; some of the things that you were saying weren't exactly, I think, as
we intended to state them. So let me just â€“ so we talked about â€“ so yes, we talked about credit. We're saying
credit is settling out. We said in the very near term, where charge-offs are â€“ tend to be higher in the first half of the
year. In the near term, based on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates, we would expect them to
settle out at 15% higher than pre-pandemic. That was a near-term forecast. That was not an annual forecast.
And then, you â€“ just to clarify â€“ your comment said: and over time, it will converge back to slightly above 2018
and 2019. I just want to say those are your words, not ours. We have not given guidance on full year charge-offs.

We tend not, generally, to give guidance on full year charge-offs. But we very much like to give you the feel of
how things are going.
So we are very much â€“ see credit settling out. You can see that the trends that continue on the second derivative
of delinquencies, and that's a very positive thing.
The â€“ there's another factor that affects charge-offs, which is recoveries. And the recoveries have been â€“ we've
been saying for quite some time, recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low charge-offs we saw
over the past three years. So that, all else equal, pushes up net losses relative to pre-pandemic levels.
And that impact is probably larger and more prolonged for us than for some of our competitors, because we tend
to have higher recovery rates than the industry, probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy, and we
tend to work most of our recoveries in-house rather than selling debt. So we see a longer tail of recoveries from
past charge-offs than most do.
So by the way, the recoveries â€“ we had talked about recoveries. There probably sort of been at their bottom in
terms of that brown out and, over time, probably heading in a more positive direction. But that also impacts the
relationship between charge-offs, pre-pandemic and where they are today.
So pulling way up, we don't have guidance for credit for the year. We continue to be very happy about charge-offs
the way after years of â€“ after a long period of normalization, that charge-offs are settling out.
We've given â€“ we just wanted to flag that the seasonality, let's just comment â€“ let's just pause for a second on the
seasonality. It still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower end of story or whether they're later.
The key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they have been â€“ than they were pre-pandemic for this
period of time. And what we'll take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how
much was lower.
But what we're saying is, to the extent that it's lower than that impacts in the very near term, the charge-off
numbers that we had talked about before. But it doesn't change our view about credit settling out. It doesn't
change our view about very positively about the consumer, about credit performance, but it's just something we
wanted to flag across both the credit card and auto business.

Good afternoon. I guess back to the Discover combination, any update to your thoughts around the timing of the
deal close? I know the Fed and the OCC just extended the comment period. And I know you've put out there, you

expect late 2024, early 2025. So any change in terms of your expectation around the timing of the close or any of
the key financial metrics that you set out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Thanks, John. So let me comment on the Federal Reserve and the OCC extending the comment period.
It's standard practice for the Federal Reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers. We expected the
extension, and we don't take any signaling on our deal from the Fed's decision here. So with respect to the overall
timing, the Fed and the OCC typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in
consultation with the DOJ on competition questions and they engage frequently with our team along the way. And
of course, that process is underway. And we continue to have the same views about the timing of all of this that
we did at the time of the announcement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. And then separately, just regarding the â€“ your expectation on the CET1 front for a
pro forma CET1 ratio of about just shy of 14%. Any change to that expectation? And any change to your thoughts
around buyback activity in the near term? Could you remain active on that front? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah, John, with respect to the deal, I'll just say, as we talked about when we announced it, we, at the time, used
a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the CET1 at the time of close. There's a number of
variables that are going to move between now and legal day one, not just the standalone performance of each of
our companies, but balance sheet marks, some of which are driven by credit and stock price. And so, I'm not
going to be in the business of recasting every time a little number moves. But I will say our valuation of the deal
considered a wide range of outcomes and so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic
benefits of the transaction as we did when we announced the deal.
With respect to our standalone repurchases, Capital One's, I'll note that the agreement with Discover does not
prohibit us from buying shares. I noted in my prepared remarks, we were blacked out for a period leading up to
the deal. And afterwards, the SEC has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can
do for a period of time after the announcement. So as a result of those limitations, Q1 had a pace that was less
than what we've done in recent quarters. I will also just note that there's also blackout restrictions on repurchases
during the proxy vote period. But again, outside of those blackouts, we're not prohibited, and we're able to
continue repurchasing shares.

Great. Thanks. Rich, putting aside the tax refund thing, I mean, yours â€“ we're sitting here looking â€“ you've still got
what has been a somewhat persistently high inflation environment and the potential for increases in
unemployment, given the nature of your portfolio, you've got kind of a lower end consumer and higher-end
consumer. How do you think about that, those factors in terms of thinking about what type of charge-off level
you're going to reach over some period of time, not a particular point in time, but over some point in the next year
or two, like where you think about that â€“ are they driving a higher level of charge-off expectations? Or how should
we think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Moshe, so our â€“ I think, what you're partly getting at is because we have â€“ part of our portfolio is subprime
consumers, how do we feel about how they're performing and sort of in the context of an environment of higher
inflation and so on. Let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer. In the global financial crisis, we
observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions, subprime â€“ we saw that, but then we
saw sort of everything move proportionately in fact, subprime moved frankly, somewhat less proportionately than
prime as a multiple.
But obviously, all portfolios worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis. In the pandemic, subprime credit
improved more and more quickly than prime, but it also began to normalize more quickly too. And of course, that's
in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding
that over time. And subprime is, of course, not synonymous with lower income, although they are somewhat
correlated.
So on the other hand, so if we look at how they have been doing â€“ the income growth from â€“ for, let's take lower-
income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years. And we have seen really quite â€“
other than the tax refund effect, which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the
higher credit end. Really, we have seen the subprime performance be very strong. It just worsened faster. And
then on a proportional basis, everything caught up with it. But it frankly always seems to be a first mover, and it
settled out, frankly, a little bit earlier than â€“ started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio.
So based on current performance, we feel very good across the credit spectrum. We also â€“ it certainly catches
our attention when we see the inflation specter sort of become greater lately. So we have a real eye on that. As
you know, we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on. But the net impression
that I would leave you is we continue to feel very good about really the full spectrum of our customers, we
continue to lean into the growth opportunities. We have, for some time, just been doing some trimming around the
edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that, credit line increases. But the impression
that I want to leave with you is that we are still pretty feel good about this marketplace and the growth
opportunities there.

Moshe Orenbuch Q

Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You alluded to â€“ or Andrew alluded to the fact that you expect that
late fee, you can still kind of achieve your objectives from a efficiency ratio even with the late fee coming into
effect. But could you talk a little bit about your thoughts about any mitigating efforts that you're planning or are in
the process of doing? Or is it something that you're going to try and use from a competitive standpoint to take
share? How do you think about it?

Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Moshe. So, let's just pull up and reflect on the fact that the CFPB's rule on late fees is
scheduled to take effect on May 14. We are prepared to implement the rule on this timeline, if necessary, but
ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule. As
we've said before, when the rule is implemented, there will be significant impact to our P&L. We expect that this
impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions.
These mitigating actions include changes to our policies, products and investment choices. Some of these
mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway. We are planning on additional actions once
we learn more about where the litigation settles out. Ultimately, these mitigating actions will play through different
line items in the P&L and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our P&L within a couple of years of their
implementation.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Rich, can you provide your latest thought on auto lending? I know a lot of focus has been around cars, and
used car prices have been a little bit lighter recently. As well as the tax issue maybe talk a bit about a potential
pivot there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So we're feeling very good about the auto business. So, let's just pull way up. Auto industry margins have
recovered somewhat over the past few quarters. Our origination volumes in Q1 were up 20% on a year-over-year
basis and quarter-over-quarter basis, and we're pleased with that growth. Now there are still headwinds to the
auto business, affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car
prices.
And even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks, they haven't yet reached a new
equilibrium. So we anticipated the risks in this business, tightening up credit back in 2022. I think several quarters
before some of our competitors. As a result, the performance of recent originations from 2022 and 2023 has been
really strong and frankly, even better than our pre-pandemic origination and vintage over vintage, that risk
remains stable. And as margins have recovered a bit, we're seeing an opportunity to lean back in. So our years of
investments in industry-leading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and
enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or
emerging risks.
So looking ahead, we remain confident in the business that we're booking and bullish about the opportunities for
growth. So we continue to set pricing in terms that we're comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities
that we see in the market. And after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back, I think this is sort
of a period where it's moving more into a â€“ leaning into a situation for Capital One. And we're, I think, very

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thank you. Rich, I think your point on tax refund is clearly a very valid one. Interestingly though, to your point on
the second derivative, that's improved quite nicely even into March and I think when I look at the tax refund stats
now from the IRS, it seems like you've seen a catch-up in refunds and it seems like the average refund numbers
have kind of come in line with last year, if not slightly higher. So I think those are improving, too. Is there a lag
effect there? So like should we see that more pronounced if that's the case in April and May? How has it been in
the past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I can see that you're a student of tax refunds. Just think of all the areas of expertise that you've
developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business, things that neither you
nor I thought we would really have to learn. Let me make a couple comments here.
So a key question is, what are we benchmarking things to? So relative to â€“ if we talk about relative to last year,
the â€“ things were even lagging relative to last year. And they've actually crossed over â€“ very, very recently
crossed over the curve from last year, which I think you're referring to.
But then, last year, really, was somewhat of an outlier relative to pre-pandemic. Now, one might ask, well, why
didn't we just do â€“ use last year as the seasonality benchmark? Last year, itself, was an odd year and, from a
credit point of view with all the normalization, it was hard to read things through the noise.
As we watch the patterns this year, we're going to really end up comparing, by the time it's done, how this year
compares to last year and whether, collectively, this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we
have to modify relative to the past. I think it's premature on that. And relative to reading seasonality, it's really hard
to look at last year's credit metrics just because there was so much normalization.
So we've had an eye on this. We have we have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks, which are
developed over a number of years. And I think, when this is â€“ when we're done with this period, we'll sit back and
look at it and say, did we learn something about the business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a
business like ours than it was before? I think it is too early to tell. But to your other point, even relative to last year,
it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds.
16


Capital One Financial Corp.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
And yes, to your point, these are things that themselves, then, have lag effects because people have to get the
refunds, then they have to make payments. So this is why, very much, we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort
of in the middle of happening. And the key thing will be, by the time it's done, what's the cumulative tax refund
effect? And we're just kind of sharing with you as we go along.
And the reason I'm particularly leaning into this particular one is because, last time we made a very near-term sort
of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets about where the â€“ given that in a year, the high part
of the year is in the first half of the year, we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year, where things
were sort of settling out.
And I wanted to give that little bit â€“ we're not revising the number, but just to say, if the seasonality patterns are â€“
probably driven by the tax refund effect, if it doesn't catch up to historical patterns, then, in the very near-term, the
numbers will be higher than that â€“ in this very â€“ this window we're talking about, higher than the 15% number that
I said.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. Understood. The second derivative looked good, nonetheless, for March.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A

Yeah. So look, can I just â€“ I want to just seize that point.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
The second derivative continues to be strong. In fact, when you look at sort of all the card players that you can
see the strength of Capital One's second derivative. There's another topic â€“ so you didn't know when you were
studying all that calculus that this would be at the heart of what you do.
But â€“ so there's lots of good to pull from this. I just wanted to just clarify the tax refund effect, which I think has a
little bit more impact on Capital One than certain other players, and to point out that we actually think we see that
effect in both of our consumer businesses.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Can we step up the run rate relative to some of the last quarters as we look ahead? I know there's been a lot of
volatility on some of the regulatory proposals on capital. But as we look ahead, I know there's no limitations, but
can we see a step up in the level of capital return relative to the past few quarters as we look ahead, given your
capital levels today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Well, there's two parts to that, Sanjay. The first is, given the transaction, we are in the process of submitting a new
capital plan. So that's just a procedural piece. So once that new capital plan is approved, then we have unlimited
capacity relative to the SCB. In this intervening period, the amount that we repurchase is constrained to what
we've requested.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good evening, Rich and Andrew. Following up on your comments on auto, how much of an advantage is
your excess capital position? Are you seeing competitors who are capital constrained and perhaps can't take
advantage of the attractive market conditions to the same degree? And then, I'll just ask my follow-up now. As
Capital One continues to grow, could you speak to your Category II preparedness?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yes, I'll start, Bill, with the â€“ oh, go ahead, Rich, do you want to do the competitive dynamics in auto?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
In auto â€“ I'm â€“ here â€“ my observation about the auto business is that it's still a very competitive marketplace, but
when we see our opportunities to grow, we tend to zig a little bit while others zag. And so, we sort of pulled back
for a little while and others leaned in. And my point is really, now, I think we're leaning in and others are pulling
back a little bit more. I hadn't really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the
very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that Capital One has by virtue of our
choices that we made over the last couple of years; but we'll have to think about that.
But I just think this is just very much sort of, as you've seen numerous times in the past, where there's a little bit of
an inflection point for Capital One at a time that's a little different and, occasionally, in a different direction than the
inflection points of others.

Andrew M. Young A

And then, Bill, with respect to Category II, well, first, let me just note, we're going to be below the $700 billion
threshold at closing and the trigger is really a four-quarter average beyond that. So I just wanted to mention the
specifics of what is going to trigger it. But within Category II to Category III, there's really three big distinctions.
The first one is losing the tailoring benefit for LCR and NSFR. And you can see based on the ratios that we hold
there and our conservatism around liquidity, we feel very well prepared.
The other two, which are the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital and the DTA threshold going from 25 to 10.
Those are both already included, at least in what was proposed for the Basel III Endgame rules, we all know that
those proposals are being debated and refined. But ultimately, we were looking at those two implications as part
of the proposal anyway, and so we don't really see a big difference in the long-term implications.
At least as we sit today, again, the proposal may take a different form, but from a planning perspective, those
were two things that we already had our eye on and so we ultimately feel well prepared all of the implications of
either Category II, or the Basel III Endgame proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good evening. Thanks for fitting me in. Rich, I just wanted to circle back on your comment about how you
continue to kind of trim around the edges. I think last quarter you were suggesting that the trimming was sort of
abating after a number of years of trimming. But given your comments today about how you're continuing to lean
in, how the US consumer remains strength of source. How are you thinking about potentially opening up the credit
box a little bit more from here? And relatedly, does the pending deal with Discover factor into how you're thinking
about allocating capital at all into more growth at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jeff. We â€“ the trimming around the edges is, of course, what we do all the time in â€“ reactively to not only
what we observe in the marketplace, but what we think may be coming in the marketplace. We are very much sort
of in the same place we were three months ago when we've been talking about this. In other words, the trimming
around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced in the quarters during the big credit
normalization then it has been as we see things settling out.
And the drivers of that continue to be â€“ probably in addition to what I said about the consumer, very much also the
observing our credit performance, not only just the overall portfolio performance, but very much the performance
of our originations and strikingly our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarter-after-
quarter, obviously, that's lagged data that we're viewing but we're â€“ we've been struck by how long it's been and
how consistently it's been that our originations have been generally on top of each other, And a lot of that comes
from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing even as there's been some underlying a little bit sort
19


Capital One Financial Corp.

of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics. So we're in a very similar place to where we were. We feel good
about our credit performance and origination performance. We are leaning in across the credit spectrum.
With respect to the Discover deal, it's not really altering our origination strategy that's very much continuing as it
was before. Obviously, we're very excited about the Discover deal, but I think that with respect to our own strategy
it's really pretty much the same as it was before.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And I also wanted to just ask really quickly about the small business card strategy. I know you recently just
launched that new Venture X business card recently. It seems like a really unique value proposition with the
charge card component. Can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity to drive growth there and maybe
how that's going so far? Any early read into the type of customers you're getting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Yes, Jeff. So we launched the Venture X business card broadly in the third quarter of last year, and we're
pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far. So Venture X business, much like our
Spark Cash Plus card was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset
spending limit, great travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere.
And it's a great example of our businesses leveraging each other's innovations because we've taken many of the
industry-leading travel features of our consumer Venture X product and combined them with the business-grade
capabilities of our small business offerings, including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger
businesses. So we have been investing in our small business card program and more broadly to win at the top of
the market for years. And this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment. It stands on the shoulders
of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of Capital One to win at the top of
the market across consumers and small business. So I appreciate the question, and we certainly are excited by
our continuing progress.
