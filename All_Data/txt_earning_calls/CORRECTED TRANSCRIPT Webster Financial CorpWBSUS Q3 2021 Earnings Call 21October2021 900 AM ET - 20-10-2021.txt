Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Thanks, Kristen. Good morning and thank you for joining Webster's third quarter earnings call. CFO, Glenn
MacInnes and I are here in Waterbury, and we will review our performance for the quarter. I'll also provide an
update on the status of our merger process with Sterling and at the end of our presentation, Glenn and I will take
your questions.
Despite the continued impact of COVID, expectations for higher inflation, and supply chain and labor challenges,
we see increased economic activity and strengthening confidence from our business and consumer clients with
respect to demand for products and services. And we've seen improving loan activity, which, coupled with
anticipated higher interest rates, should benefit the banking industry and Webster. Credit qualities remained
remarkably strong for Webster and for the industry as a whole.
With respect to our internal transformational project, we continue to make significant progress on the strategic
revenue enhancements and operational efficiencies across the organization in order to achieve our fourth quarter
2021 cost savings target. Glenn will provide more detail in his remarks.
Related to our merger with Sterling, our teams have been working diligently and collaboratively to prepare for our
closing and remain on schedule for all integration design, planning, and execution activities. We're in a position to
close the transaction shortly after we receive the final regulatory approvals on our application. In August, we
received approval from our primary regulator, the OCC and shareholders of both banks. While we have no
certainty on the timing of the final approvals, we're hopefully we will receive them during the fourth quarter. Based
on our communications with regulators and the fact that there are no outstanding information requests, we remain
confident that an approval is forthcoming.
With respect to the strategic rationale for the merger, I can say that through integration planning, our team is more
excited about the deal and the opportunities that the combination will provide for our clients, colleagues,
communities, and shareholders than we were during due diligence and that announcement. The two
organizations are very complementary with virtually no customer or branch footprint overlap and the strong
commercial banking teams at both banks will benefit from a larger balance sheet and a more diversified combined
[ph] loan book balance. (00:03:22) We are creating a unique, commercially-focused mid-sized bank with
differentiated businesses and a diverse and growing funding profile.
Interestingly, last week, both Sterling and Webster were among five banks nationally to be recognized by
Coalition Greenwich as 2021 Greenwich CX leaders; financial services leaders that have excelled in customer
satisfaction, customer loyalty, and creating an environment that is easy for the customer to do business.
Specifically, each bank was recognized for customer experience in commercial middle market banking.
I'll begin the financial report on slide 2. Our financial metrics remained strong. We continue to execute on our
fundamental banking activities, organically adding new customers and deepening existing relationships across all
business lines and geographies. Excluding PPP, linked quarter loan balances grew by 11% annualized. Despite
NIM compression, the strong loan growth enabled us to increase net interest income by 4% when compared to
last quarter.
Our adjusted earnings per share in Q3 were $1.08. Third quarter performance includes $5.8 million of net pre-tax
charges related to the merger and our strategic initiatives. Tangible common equity grew by 7% and is $171
million higher than a year ago. Total revenue in Q3 was 6.5% higher than a year ago, while adjusted expenses
decreased 2.7%. Our efficiency ratio improved to 55%, a decrease of more than 500 basis points from a year ago.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Our third quarter adjusted return on common equity was 12% and the adjusted return on tangible common was
nearly 15%. Our $8 million provision was driven by strong loan growth and resulted in a reserve build of $7 million
in the quarter. Credit quality remains solid with key asset quality metrics continuing to be [ph] in-year (00:05:19)
cycle lows. As a percentage of the portfolio, NPLs, net charge-offs, and commercial classified loans were all
better than a year ago. And our percentage of NPLs to total loans is at its lowest point since before the Great
Recession.
I'm now on slide 3. Excluding PPP, total loans grew 3.3% from a year ago, led by commercial loan growth of $700
million or 5%. This is a very strong quarter for commercial banking with $1.2 billion of loan originations, up solidly
from a year ago, driven by growth in Sponsor & Specialty, Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market and Business
Banking verticals. Loan fundings of $967 million were up 62% or $372 million from a year ago.
Consumer loans grew 3.8% or $252 million from second quarter and declined less than 1% compared to prior
year. The linked quarter increase reflected stronger purchase mortgage and lower refinance activity during the
quarter. Overall, residential mortgage activities drove 82% of consumer loan originations, flat to linked quarter
from a year ago.
I'm now on slide 4. Deposits grew 11.5% year-on-year driven across all business lines. Core deposits grew by
$3.8 billion and represent 94% of total deposits compared to 90% a year ago; while CDs declined $686 million
from a year ago. Deposit costs continue to decline and were 6 basis points in total in the quarter. Commercial
banking deposits are up more than 23% from a year ago primarily driven from municipalities and excess liquidity
among clients across all lines of business and all geographies.
Retail banking deposits grew 7.3% year-over-year with consumer and small business deposits growing 6.5% and
12.7% respectively. Retail deposit costs have continued to decline as well and totaled 5 basis points in the
quarter. Turning to HSA Bank, total deposits grew 5% year-over-year or 8% on a core basis excluding the TPA
balances. Total footings grew 14% year-over-year.
Slide 5 provides an overview of the transaction and integration timeline. As I discussed earlier, merger integration
activities continue to be on track with the team from both banks working collaboratively and tirelessly to position
us for success at close and beyond. We are prepared to successfully combine the two companies and begin
operations shortly after we receive the necessary approvals.
As shared in our merger announcement in April, Jack Kopnisky and I both recognized that a critical element of
success in bringing these two companies together is from a cultural perspective. As such, we've established a
cultural integration framework that provides a clear and aligned view on the purpose and values of the
organization and what we will expect from our colleagues in terms of guiding behaviors and performance. The
new executive management team is working together to ensure that our combined culture reflects the strengths
that both banks bring to the combination.
With that, I'll now turn it over to Glenn for the financial review.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We reported another quarter of solid results, evidenced by strong
loan growth, favorable credit performance and continued execution on our merger and strategic initiatives. I'll
begin with our average balance sheet on slide 6.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Average securities increased $76 million linked quarter. Securities represented 27% of total assets at September
30. During the quarter, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion in securities, up from $600 million in the prior
quarter. Purchases had a weighted yield of 1.44% and a duration of five years. Securities called, matured or paid
down total around $500 million, with a yield of 2.23%. Our average cash balance held at the Fed totaled $2.3
billion, an increase of 1.1 billion linked quarter, driven by growth in commercial deposits. Average loans increased
$125 million, or 0.6% linked quarter, primarily driven by an increase in C&I, commercial real estate and residential
mortgages, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness.
During the quarter, forgiveness on PPP loans totaled $448 million, and the remaining PPP loans were $398
million. In Q3, we recognized $60 million of PPP deferred fee accretion, and the remaining deferred fees totaled
$15 million. Excluding PPP, average loans grew $650 million or 3.2%. Average commercial loans grew $427
million or 3.1%, while residential mortgage loans increased $297 million or 6.3%.
Average deposits grew $1.1 billion, or 4% linked quarter. The increase was driven by continued growth in
commercial transaction, deposit products, and was partially offset by a decline in higher cost retail CDs. Average
borrowings were flat to Q2 and down $1 billion from prior year as a result of excess liquidity.
Borrowings represent 3.8% of total assets at September 30, compared to 7% a year ago. The loan-to-deposit
ratio was 72% at September 30. The common equity tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points linked quarter to
11.77%. The tangible common equity ratio decreased 20 basis points to 7.71%, as a result of balance sheet
growth. And tangible book value grew 2.2% linked quarter and 6.4% from prior year.
Slide 7 highlights our GAAP performance and adjustments to reported income available to common. During the
quarter, we've recognized a net of $4.3 million after-tax charges related to our merger and strategic initiatives. On
an adjusted basis, income available to common was $98 million or $1.08 per share, resulting in a 12.2% return on
average common equity and a 14.8% return on tangible common equity.
On slide 8, we provide our reported-to-adjusted income statement. On an adjusted basis, net interest income
increased by $9 million linked quarter, driven by loan growth and PPP fee accretion, which was partially offset by
a lower yield on securities. NIM of 2.8% declined two basis points from prior quarter primarily due to an increase
in excess deposits held at the Fed, partially offset by higher PPP fee accretion. Excluding excess liquidity and
PPP fees, third quarter NIM was approximately flat linked quarter. As compared to prior year, net interest income
increased by $10 million. This was a result of higher PPP fee accretion, lower funding cost and loan growth, which
was partially offset by lower yields in the securities portfolio.
Non-interest income increased $11 million linked quarter primarily driven by fair value adjustments of $6 million on
direct investments and $3 million on customer derivatives, as well as higher loan-related fees of $3 million. This
was partially offset by a decline of $2 million in HSA fee income due to lower exit fees on TPA accounts and a
seasonal decline in interchange revenue.
Compared to prior year, non-interest income grew $8.7 million. This reflects an increase of $9 million related to
fair value adjustments on direct investments, $6.1 million from higher loan and deposit service fees, and $1.7
million increase in investment income. This was partially offset by declines of $5.6 million in mortgage banking
revenue and $2.5 million in HSA fee income. The reduction in mortgage banking revenue was the result of
holding more loans on the balance sheet as we deployed excess liquidity into fixed rate loans. The decline in HSA
fee income was driven by $3.2 million in TPA closure fees recorded a year ago.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Adjusted non-interest expense increased $5.6 million from prior quarter, reflective of a $4.3 million increase in
performance-based compensation and a $1.4 million increase in technology expense. Versus prior year, non-
interest expense declined $4.8 million due to our previously announced efficiency initiatives resulting in lower
occupancy costs, compensation and other expenses. Pre-provision net revenue was $139 million in Q3. This
compares to $125 million in Q2 and $115 million in prior year. Our CECL provision in the quarter reflects an
expense of $7.8 million. The adjusted tax rate was 23.8%, an increase of 15 basis points linked quarter. The net
result is an adjusted net income of $98 million or $1.08 per share, down from $1.21 per share in prior quarter.
As you see on slide 9, we reported a $5 million linked quarter increase in core non-interest expense. This was
primarily the result of performance-related compensation as evidenced by balance sheet and revenue growth and
strong credit quality. We expect to complete the execution of our strategic initiatives by the end of the year and
remain on track to deliver core expenses in the range of $164 million in Q4. Any variability would be related to
performance-based compensation. The cost savings on this slide are reflective of our standalone initiatives. Over
the last six months, we've made meaningful progress on our integration plans with Sterling and remain confident
in our ability to deliver 11% of incremental cost synergies on a combined basis.
Turning to slide 10, I'll review the results of our third quarter allowance for loan losses under CECL. In the quarter,
we reported an $8 million provision expense and a $7 million increase in the allowance. The allowance coverage
ratio, excluding PPP loans, remained flat at 1.49% with total reserves of $315 million. As we looked at the trend
from Q2 to Q3, we established $6 million of reserves related to commercial and residential loan growth and $2
million due to credit quality and macroeconomic trends.
Slide 11 highlights our key asset quality metrics, reflecting strong credit quality performance trends.
Nonperforming loans in the upper left declined $20 million from Q2. Commercial, residential mortgage, and
consumer each recorded linked quarter declines. NPLs, as a percent of total loans, are 47 basis points, down
from 74 basis points a year ago. Net charge-offs in the upper right were $900,000 in the quarter, including $1.6
million in net charges for commercial and $700,000 in net recoveries for consumer. Year-to-date, we have
recorded $5 million in net charge-offs, which is on track for our lowest level since 2005. Commercial classified
loans in the lower left increased $2 million from Q2 and represent 251 basis points of total commercial loans.
Slide 12 highlights our strong capital levels. Regulatory capital ratios exceed well-capitalized levels by substantial
amounts. Our common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.77% exceeds well-capitalized by more than $1.2 billion. Likewise,
tier 1 risk-based capital of 12.39% exceeds well-capitalized levels by $1 billion.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect average core loan growth, excluding PPP loans, to be in a range of
2% to 2.5%. Net interest income will decline $3 million linked quarter, primarily due to lower PPP income. Non-
interest income will decline around $4 million linked quarter as a net result of nonrecurring fair value marks on
direct investments and customer derivatives. As indicated earlier, core expenses will be in a range of $164 million.
Any variability would be related to performance-based compensation, and our tax rate will be similar to Q3 levels.
With that, I'll turn it back over to John for closing remarks.

Lastly, I want to say a big thank you to all of our colleagues for their commitment to our values and dedication to

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please
proceed.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Glenn, maybe I'll start with you on the deployment in the quarter on the securities book, we've seen a lot of
your peers be a little bit more aggressive in deploying cash. What are your thoughts into the merger in terms of
redeploying more cash into the investment portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Good morning, Chris. Yeah. In the quarter, we had an average balance at the Fed of about $2.2 billion. And
we have begun to deploy some of that. So, we're below $2 billion as we speak. And so, I think you would expect
with a combination of both loan growth and securities deployment that you'd probably – we'd probably end the
quarter on average for fourth quarter of about $1 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, $1 billion cash. Great. And then, maybe a question on capital. Once the deal closes, you guys have a lot of
capital and you're generating a lot of capital. Can you just – John, can you just talk about the buyback and the
potential magnitude of a buyback?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I mean, I know when we put out the announcement of the transaction, we showed a $400 million stock
repurchase to sort of plug excess capital there. We've talked about a 10.5% target CET1 ratio. And then, what I
would say is what I always say, which is, we'd like to deploy capital in areas where we think we can generate and

maximize economic profits first. Clearly, this company will have a lot of excess cash pro forma for the – capital pro
forma for the combination, and we also generate a lot of capital each year.
So, we'll then look at dividend and buybacks. And certainly, I think we have the capacity for significant stock
repurchase. But again, if we find areas where we can accelerate loan growth, look at acquiring portfolios of
commercial loans or deploying capital into our differentiated businesses, that's first choice. But we'll be
appropriate in our allocation of capital deployment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I think you said last quarter the – you think the pro forma company can do double-digit loan growth.
Sterling's results supported that last night. Any change to your view on your prior comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Chris, it's funny. I still think 8% to 10% growth is absolutely achievable. Could we outperform that? We're going to
have a larger balance sheet. We'll have higher holds. But the market's still not back to normal in terms of loan
demand and we've seen fewer payoffs in the last couple of quarters. So, I think the prudent guidance sticks with
approaching that double-digit loan growth, which we think, as a combined company, we can achieve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Just on expenses, obviously, the delta was driven by performance-based comp. And it sounds like that could
happen, at least that's on the table again for the fourth quarter. So, could you just outline for us what
performance-based comp was this quarter? And is that a good range to consider for the fourth quarter?

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So, I think there was a bit of a true-up, Matt – it's Glenn – in the third quarter based on our performance. So,
it spiked up in the third quarter. I – at anything, I would expect it to be somewhere between $1 million and $1.5
million in the fourth quarter at most.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I wouldn't pull it forward or push it forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe if you could just talk about the health, the strength of the pipeline. Obviously, you're very
optimistic on long-term loan growth. But how do you feel about it over the next three to six months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. I'm getting more bullish. I think we talked last time around the fact that before you saw a sort of back-
to-normal loan demand, a lot of these companies and individuals needed to kind of deploy their excess liquidity.
And then, obviously, with some uncertainty, and you see supply chain issues and labor issues, maybe people are
a little reticent to invest. But, obviously, we saw a good third quarter following a pretty good second quarter for us,
and our pipeline going into the fourth quarter is one of the strongest it's been in the last several years and that's
across all of our business lines.
Utilization, we still haven't seen a significant tick-up there. So, that could be a tailwind if, in fact, we start to see
people on the asset conversion cycle in businesses like ABL start to pick up a little bit. So, I'm getting more
bullish, and we are seeing a lot of pent-up activity. But, again, I still think there's a lot of liquidity out there, and we
haven't seen line utilizations tick up. So, I'm still thinking we're kind of going to be cranking as we get into the
second and third quarter next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. And then, just to follow up on the last question, the near double-digit loan growth on a combined basis. In
this market, from Boston to New York, these are traditionally slower growth markets, it's going to be a much
bigger balance sheet. Could you just walk us through maybe some of the areas that might need to change on a
combined basis in order for you to get there or maybe it's nothing at all? I mean, are you considering bringing
some business lines national or adding new business lines? Could you just give us a sense for – historically,
banks that big, it's just tough for them to get that kind of loan growth, how do you intend to get there?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Sure. I think our current assumptions of 8% to 10% really are BAU. So it doesn't – we're likely to continue in all
specialized national and local businesses out of the gate. And so, we've done a lot of discussions. We've done a
lot of diligence. We like all the businesses. It gives us a lot of levers. It gives us diversity across geographies. It
gives us some national franchises. And so, I don't think that we will make any significant adjustments to the lines
of businesses that we're focused on or the geographies we're in over the short term.
But then – and you know Jack and you know us. I think we'll, obviously, look at each of our businesses as we
move forward and as we get bigger and think: where are the risk-return dynamics; can we generate significant
economic profits in that business; can we maintain our competitive position maybe in some of the smaller niche
businesses. But the short answer to your question is how do we look at 8% to 10% loan growth next year. It's
really executing on all the business lines that the combined bank will have currently, and I think there are
opportunities for us to go deeper in some businesses and accelerate that trajectory. But that's not included in our
strategic plan right now.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just zeroing in on a couple of aspects of loan growth, I think you covered the Sponsor & Specialty in C&I.
What are you thinking in terms of residential especially in the Q4 timeframe, the seasonal slowdown? And also,
you noted some strength in CRE. Maybe you could talk about those two areas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Our Commercial Real Estate actually had one of its biggest origination and funding quarters in quite some
time, so there's obviously activity there. But again, we always talk about the dynamic of originations and pay-
downs. And we had fewer pay downs in Commercial Real Estate in the quarter, and that benefited kind of a net
growth. You'll see most of our growth continue to come in the commercial categories, Brock. But we have had a
couple of strong quarters in residential mortgage just given the dynamics of interest rates and kind of activity in

the marketplace and where people are moving. Connecticut's been the beneficiary of a lot of influx, which is
where we have most of our residential loan exposure. So, that's helped.
We do think that'll slow a little bit just given the seasonality fourth quarter in winter. So, that never really moves
the needle ultimately for our significant loan growth much. So, I would say you can anticipate our residential
originations and fundings to be slightly lower than the prior quarter. And we expect the commercial pipelines,
which are robust, to continue to convert into funded loans in the fourth quarter.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And, Glenn, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but if you could just kind of review and kind of
connect the cord for us between the operating expense we saw at Q3 and your goal for Q4 and kind of how we
get from here to there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I did kind of hit on it, and I think one of the bigger drivers was this performance-based compensation.
And so, that was the largest driver that will drive that number. There are other things that are, sort of, more
seasonal, whether it's marketing transact – timing of mailing campaigns and things like that. But again, when I pull
it all together, we still feel comfortable or feel that we'll hit that $164 million – around $164 million; and, like I said,
subject to any variability on performance-based comp. That $164 million excludes like amortization and things like
that, just so you know, it's efficiency-based.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions for you. Starting with – on loans, you spoke about the growth, but I wanted to
touch on the pricing – loan pricing. And on slide 3, I see how the yield increased to 3.6% in the third quarter, I'm
assuming PPP was a key driver of that. But can you talk about the loan pricing environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Sure, David. It's good to hear from you. Yeah. The 14 basis point quarter-over-quarter increase in yield
wasn't really on, kind of, the pricing, it was on acceleration. The biggest drivers were acceleration of deferred fees
on PPP and other loans, on prepaying. So, I'll give you a sense, in the quarter, from an origination standpoint, our
yields actually held up pretty well in terms of prior quarter, which is a good sign. So, we're not seeing a lot of
degradation in price.

And they range from anywhere from kind of the mid-2s yields for high-quality Commercial Real Estate to
approaching 5% on a good Sponsor & Specialty deals, around 4% on Business Banking and Middle Market kind
of somewhere in that 2.5% range to 3%. So, depending on the mix, those are the coupons on our originations and
we didn't see much degradation over the last several quarters, which in a competitive market, was a plus for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Just if I understand a little more, so if you look at the third quarter versus the second quarter, Dave, I mean
the yield is basically flat. If you adjust out for PPP, I think in the second quarter the yield on the total book was
3.40% and the third quarter was like 3.38%. So it's basically flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for that. And then shifting to HSA, can you talk about the pipeline there as we head into the open
enrollment period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure. We've had a good year in selling activity. And as we've talked about, our growth has been around
market particularly in the direct to employer channels, our partners, healthcare partners have grown a little bit less
quickly. Our pipeline this year is good. Obviously, a lot of what we – everything that's going to really matter for
enrollment period, most of that is kind of in process and we think it looks fairly encouraging right now. I'd say that,
obviously, this quarter is kind of slow as we approach the enrollment period.
The wild card in the last couple of years and through the pandemic with the whole industry has been less new
customer acquisition and more the amount of accounts signed up with your large employers. And with changing
employment dynamics, less hiring, more disruption, that's slowed a bit. We always talk about 75% to 80% of our
new accounts every year actually comes from our existing customers and that's kind of waned a little bit last year.
So, what I would say is we're hoping with a changing employment market to the positive that with a good selling
season for us and onboarding of new customers, better retention and a more normalized new account opening
from existing customers, we should see a pretty robust enrollment period. So, we're enthusiastic right now. And,
obviously, I'm reticent to give you any numbers because we don't really have a line of sight, and we'll start talking
about it in the fourth quarter when we start to see enrollment.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, Glenn. We've spoken about your deposit beta. Can you share with everyone just overall, on slide 22, your
rate sensitivity analysis? What goes into the deposit beta for the first, say, 50 basis points and just curious in the
subsequent 50 basis points as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Steven. Good question. And I'll refer you back to page 22, where you see our short end up 50
basis points, and increased asset sensitivity of 6.2% on PPNR. It is the factor that we have lowered our deposit
beta, it was as high as 32 basis points. We did lower it to, say, between 25 basis points and 30 basis points. But
the fact of the matter is, even in a rising rate environment, we're assuming a lag. So, the first 25 basis points that
we think the beta will be closer to 11 basis points. And, in fact, the second 25 basis points, 11 basis points as
well. It's not until like that third lift that we started to see that, at least from a modeling standpoint, the beta's come
back in.
And at that point, we'd say, 20%. And then by, the first 100 basis points it would probably be closer to our
[indiscernible] (00:33:12) what we now say is our full beta of, say, 29%. So, there is a lag in there. That is built into
this – what you see back on page 22. And it's a wild card. I mean, there is a school of thought that says it's going
to be closer to zero for the first two moves. So, anything like that would be additive to our asset sensitivity.

We think it's backed up. And as I said earlier, we don't have a clear line of sight to timing. We've had really good
discussions and dialogue with all the various regulators. So, what we can say, we announced the deal in April, if
you look at historic timelines. On mergers, we're still kind of well in a comfortable zone. So, we don't think that
there's anything sort of behind the scenes that could derail this transaction. And so, the only thing I want to say is
we've answered all the questions. We really like our application, the merits of the transaction itself. And so, we
think it's just timing.

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Laurie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Glenn, just wondering if you could comment on the jump in your leverage [ph] S&S (00:35:07) and just how we
should think about that. So, from a $200 million linked quarter, where are your plans to grow that? Is that a chunk
of where the loan growth is going to come in terms of your projection?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think – Laurie, I think we've demonstrated over time a really disciplined approach in terms of making sure
that our enterprise-reliant lending, whether it's regulatorily leveraged or not, the activities in that book remain
within the appropriate level given the entire loan book. That's one of the reasons why we think that this transaction
will be so terrific is because it does give us some more running room from a risk management framework and a
concentration framework to continue to grow Sponsor & Specialty.
What's interesting is that that business has high originations. It's very profitable, as you know, and we think we're
kind of the best in the business at it. But it also has a relatively low and short average life. So, a lot of times you
see good originations and a lot of payoffs. So, again, I don't think you will see disproportionate outsized growth
over the long term. And I think once we close the merger, our concentration there is about half of what it was, we'll
be able to accelerate growth there to the point we can. We are certainly not in a position right now where us, the
regulators, our risk infrastructure, our risk committee is concerned with respect to overall exposure.

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And, so sorry, just to follow up. So, right, so your $1.4 billion of your $3.6 billion. But maybe asked a
different way, what percentage would you like the leverage piece of that to be when you think about growth going
forward? Is that going to stay around the same 60/40? Or how do you think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think I'm not sure we look at it that way. I think we look at our overall risk rating. There are some
leveraged deals that are actually very highly risk rated and they fit regulatory definition. So, I think as a
percentage of tier 1 capital and reserves, we kind of look at our Sponsor & Specialty overall enterprise book. And
we're kind of comfortable with whatever it is right now, $3.6 billion on a $20 billion loan portfolio. We still think we
have some running room. So, if you look forward to a $40 billion loan portfolio, we've got significant running room.
And I think we've been prudent risk managers throughout and we'll continue to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. Helpful. Thanks. Just – can you just clarify the gain that you booked on the strategic initiatives of $4
million? What exactly was that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah So – Laurie, it's Glenn. That was a reversal of an estimate we made on severance liabilities. And it was sort
of driven by two things. One is that we had a higher retention rate on some of our employees. And the second
was that there are initiatives that are tied to things like the core banking platform and loan systems. So, given the
MOE, we, sort of, paused on some of those, until we make those final decisions. So, that's really what's driving
the $4 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
That makes sense. Okay. Just last question, if you can help a little bit on margins, I'm looking at margin ex-PPP, it
looks like it was $265 million in June, now $260 million in September. If we fast forward maybe two quarters, so
the PPP, for the most part, is gone and then Sterling has rolled in, how should we be thinking about your pro
forma margin? Any help you can give us there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me give you some color on what we see from Q3 to Q4 first. And then – because you're right, the PPP
does run off, but it's sort of offset by the deployment of some of our excess cash as well. So, if you think about it
going into the Q4, you'll have, say, 7 basis points less as a result of PPP coming down. And then you'll have
some compression on the securities portfolio and that will be offset by the deployment – primarily offset by the
deployment of cash, as well as I think we have a little bit more room on deposits. You would expect to see our
deposit cost down closer to 5 basis points in the fourth quarter.
So, that you would expect all things considered and I sort of gave the guidance on net interest income, down $3
million. It sort of backs into like a 3-basis-point compression into the fourth quarter on NIM. And then as you get
into the first quarter, you obviously don't have the benefit of PPP. So you lose that but you more than offset that
on the deployment of excess cash. So it should bode well for core, meaning core ex-PPP net interest margin.

Yeah. No, we [indiscernible] (00:40:58) and it's sort of went back and forth. I mean, I think we're closer to where
we were when we announced the transaction in April today given where the tenure is at [ph] $1.63 (00:41:10).
And so, in other words, a bit of a dip in rates during the second quarter but I think we're sort of back very close to
where we were when we made the announcement, but all that has to be where we were when we made the
announcement. But they're all that that has to be trued-up.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting, and I've said this a number of times, Jared, that – particularly in this market, there hasn't
been as much trading of traditional like Middle Market – we're taking from People's or Citizens or they're taking
from us because a lot of banks, including Webster and I'm sure Sterling as well, have done a really good job of
hugging their customers. We're seeing a lot of taking advantage.
And I think this is – and I've described this to the market before, one of the advantages of our Commercial Real
Estate and our Sponsor & Specialty business is taking advantage of economic growth and activity with sponsors.
And I use that word sponsors to capture commercial real estate investors, private equity sponsors, family offices
who are engaged in capital markets activities, acquisitions, mergers, trading of property.
So, when I look at this quarter, for example, we're doing a good job in business banking of winning more than our
fair share. And I think we've got a strong business banking franchise from Boston to Westchester County. So, I
think that's where our folks are fighting really well on the ground with good products, turning credits around
quickly. And so, I think that's kind of where we might be gaining share through growth.
I think on Sponsor & Specialty and Commercial Real Estate, it's the depth and duration of the relationships that
we have with our sponsors and our commercial real estate investors, where we've demonstrated surety of
execution over a long period of time. And those transactions are less competitive. Not saying we're the only one,
but we're the first call or we're the second call and then we can kind of win that business. And oftentimes, it's a
new acquisition or a repositioning acquisition of a piece of property rather than saying we're going up against an
incumbent bank, we're going up against other banks and non-banks to provide financing based on go-forward
economic activity.
So, I don't think we're gaining significant Middle Market market share in traditional multi-generational middle
market companies. I think we're gaining more disproportionate share in the economic activity that's coming back
after the pandemic through transactions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. That's great color. I guess, shifting a little bit to the credit side, credit's very strong. I guess I was
surprised to see the allowance ratio stay flat. Can you give some color over how you're looking at the progression
back to more of a day one level? And how we should be thinking about that, I guess, in light of also – when the
deal closes, you'll have an additional supplemental credit coverage from the provision in the credit market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. As Glenn noted, almost the entire provision was related to robust growth on the balance sheet in terms of
loans and mix. And so, we're obviously very disciplined in the CECL process. We rely on our models. While it's
still positive going forward, not significant change in the forward outlook, you've got labor challenges and supply
chain disruption as well. So, we're sort of status quo, but adding for significant balance sheet growth. And I think
what you'll see over time is, as the economy continues to grow, and as our – we continue to maintain strong asset
quality, there's an opportunity for us, and that model will show us that the 1.49% may be able to come down a bit.

So, I know a lot of people think strategically about their CECL model, but we kind of stick to the regimen of the
process. And as we said, there's nothing in the portfolio that's giving us concern, but we'll continue to make sure
that we're providing for a life of loan projected losses over overall loan growth.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just finally for me, maybe, Glenn, you can just comment on the LIBOR transition, how
that's going. And then we've seen some data that shows that potentially the SOFR spreads are a little bit better.
Are you seeing that at all, or is it still...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No, there's, I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
[indiscernible] (00:46:08) LIBOR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And so, first of all, we're well positioned on a LIBOR standpoint. I think we actually have a transaction coming up
that will be SOFR-based. This spread between SOFR and LIBOR, for the most part, I would think that the market
is probably going to price based on that, right? So, I think that remains to be seen, but I would be surprised if
everyone prices down to SOFR without some kind of spread on top of it. So, we haven't seen enough in the
market yet to determine that. But that's kind of what we're thinking right now.

All right. Great. Thanks. So, just if we can go back to expenses, I just want to make sure that we're thinking about
the $164 million right. And I do recognize that if the merger closes, we may not actually see the $164 million. But
it feels like there just might be a little misunderstanding here. So, the $164 million doesn't include amortization, so
that would make it higher. And then, are you excluding all performance-based comp from the $164 million such
that we should add...

Ken, the – if you look on slide 9, we've – that's – the reason we call it efficiency-based – ratio base is that we've
excluded amortization even from the time we set the target. So, it's always been – that million has always been
moved out. My comments were that we feel confident in the $164 million, but with the understanding that if we
were up, say, $1 million or $1.5 million, it would all be performance-based compensation. That's how we feel right
now. And that's not to say that we see that right now, but if we continue to have the trends that we've had whether
it's 3.2% loan growth, favorable credit quality, and things like that, you might expect to see some of that. But,
generally, I think, we'll be in that range of $164 million.

John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken, when we set the targets and the goals, we're setting performance at plan in terms of revenue
performance. And in the last couple of months and quarters, we've actually significantly outperformed. So,
obviously, Glenn trues up the accrual and you've actually seen that across a lot of banks this quarter. And to the
extent we significantly outperformed plan in the fourth quarter and there needs to be more accruals, which we're
not saying there is right now, but there could be based on some of the pipeline and trajectory that that could be
the delta.

Got it. It would be on top of the $164 million if fees and things were positive. Okay.

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Exactly.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Yeah. Understood. Okay. And then just the other question, just going back to the reserve. Obviously, you are one
of the only banks that sort of built or kept you reserve relatively flat this quarter. I mean, do you feel that you're at
a good – well, sort of a good place for your reserve sort of on a Webster standalone basis, like, at least for the
near term? And, I guess, more importantly also like post the Sterling deal, what is the right ACL target, if you want
to call it a day one level that we should be thinking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think – look, at 1.49%, I think we feel – obviously, we feel comfortable with it, that's why we posted it. It's our
outlook on loan growth. And I think Sterling is very similar to us, as a matter of fact, as far as the coverage ratio
anyway. So, it's going to be driven by portfolio mix and economic outlook. And so, our growth, our provision for
the quarter was primarily driven by loan growth. And so, that's really what drove it. I think if you look on the slide,
we had – we took a little on for lower GDP forecast in 2021 and 2022. But the bulk of our provision for the quarter
was driven by loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hi, Ken. I've always been careful, right, being a former credit officer. The reserve is what the reserve is. As you
look through your risk rating, your probability defaults and your loss given defaults and then obviously, you've got
your macroeconomic factors. And so, we're at the right level right now. Do – from a management perspective,
when I look qualitatively at the portfolio, is there room for that to come down on a combined basis as well when
concentrations across a larger portfolio will go down? Sure, there is. And I think if you continue to see economic
growth and the macro factors continue to improve and you continue to see good credit quality and good credit
management for us and for Webster 2.0, that number can certainly come down.
And I'd also remind people, we feel very good about our credit performance. If you look back now, particularly in
Commercial Banking going back 15 years, I think we've been able to out-deliver and outperform. But our Sponsor
& Specialty business does carry with it by definition because it's enterprise reliant, higher loss given defaults.
Now, they haven't emerged in our execution over time. But so, when the mix is more Sponsored & Specialty, you
also see us have a more robust provision. So, that's, kind of, the way to describe it. But we're at the right level
right now, continued execution and macro environment improvements, that number can come down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. I guess that's why I was asking, the – what is that future number, what could that future number be in a
better environment? Other banks would refer to it as sort of their CECL [indiscernible] (00:51:49) number. But if
you don't want to comment, I understand. I just thought I'd throw it out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No – yeah, I don't think I can intelligently accept to say, I think – you're right, there is some credence to looking at
that legal day one, if you believe that that's the right macro environment and the size of the portfolio. And then up
or down, depending on the mix of originations and what the combined bank at a $40 billion balance sheet, which
will probably lower correlated risks and concentrations could provide some relief. I just don't want to speculate on
it right now.
