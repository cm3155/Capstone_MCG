Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Now, for the opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione. Please go ahead.

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Good afternoon, and welcome to Western Alliance's second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today
are Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer.
I will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current
economic environment. And then, Dale will walk you through the bank's financial performance. Afterwards, we will
open the line to take your questions.
I would like to focus on three trends that were present in this quarter and will continue throughout the year, PPNR
strength, credit provisioning expense and balance sheet growth. Combined, these trends will support earnings
and capital growth and dividend distribution throughout 2020 and 2021.
Starting with our second quarter results, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million and EPS of
$0.93, which was up 12% over the previous quarter. Tangible book value per share of $27.84 was an increase of
4.2% over the previous quarter and 12.9% year-over-year. Driving these results was record operating pre-
provision net revenue of $194.7 million, up 27.7% year-over-year and 19.1% quarter-over-quarter with strong
operating PPNR ROA growth of 18 basis points to 2.56% which benefited from a recognition of $13.9 million in
Payment Protection Program net fees. These results demonstrate that the long-term earnings power of Western
Alliance's core business remains strong under the current economic and market volatility and will support
significant ongoing capital accumulation, provide financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth and
accommodate changes to the allowance for credit losses for revisions to the economic outlook.
In the quarter, we recorded provision for credit losses of $92 million versus $51.2 million in Q1, which was
primarily attributable to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions and net charge-offs of $5.5 million. Dale
will go into more detail in a bit on the specific drivers of our provisions. But our total loan ACL-to-funded loan ratio
now stands at 1.39% or $347 million. Continuing our strong balance sheet momentum from 2019, loans increased
$1.9 billion this quarter to $25 billion and deposits grew $2.7 billion to $27.5 billion.
Without the inclusion of PPP, loans grew a more modest $117 million and deposits demonstrated strong growth of
approximately $1.6 billion. The lower adjusted loan growth reflects muted demand for which we held back on
marketing activities and directed our focus to low-loss, high-quality loan segments in addition to assisting our
clients with their PPP applications. We are encouraged by our pipeline and our opportunity to continue to grow in
low-risk asset classes. Throughout the crisis, we have continued to attract new, high-quality relationships to our
bank at pricing and terms that would not have been available to us in other circumstances.
Furthermore, this quarter's positive operating leverage supported our expanding PPNR, as our strong efficiency
ratio improved sharply to 36.3% compared to prior year. Becoming more efficient during this economic uncertainty
provides the incremental flexibility to maintain PPNR. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in new product
offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency. But Q2 levels are temporary and will eventually rise
back to a sustainable level in the low-40s. However, our branch-light business model and our national business
line strategy continue to give us a competitive advantage.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Finally, supported by our healthy PPNR generation, Western Alliance remains well capitalized with a CET1 ratio
of 10.2%, which puts us in a position of strength uniquely prepared to address what's ahead in this uncertain
environment.
Now, let's take a moment to provide an update on Western Alliance's response to the COVID pandemic. First and
foremost, I want to acknowledge the health and safety of our people and clients are of our utmost concern. We
continue to follow CDC protocol and state-by-state return-to-work guidance as our organization returns to the
office. Our business continuity plans have been working as anticipated. And I want to thank all of our people who
continue to go above the call of duty to get the job done and serve our clients in this unique environment.
As I initially described in our Q1 earnings call, WAL's unique credit risk management strategy is focused on
establishing individual borrower-level strategies and direct customer dialogue to develop long-term financial plans.
Our approach to payment deferral request is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients, along with
assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests. We ask our clients to work hand-in-
hand with us, whereby our clients contribute liquidity, capital or equity as an integral component to modify
payment plans. Our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower, government and banks' balance
sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the six-month window provided for the Cares Act.
Since April 1, WAL has funded $1.9 billion of PPP loans, which provided an expedient liquidity to over 4,700
clients and benefited more than 150,000 employees. At quarter end, $2.9 billion or 11.5% of loans have been
modified with the bulk of these loans received in principal and interest deferrals. Excluding the Hotel Franchise
Finance segment, in which we executed a unique sector deferral strategy, the bank-wide deferral rate is
approximately 5%. The vast majority of our borrowers elected to utilize their own resources or PPP funds to
bridge their business through the COVID crisis.
I will provide an update on the portfolios most impacted by COVID later on, but I do want to highlight in our Hotel
Franchise Finance portfolio our sophisticated hotel sponsors continue to see value in and support their properties
with 92% of deferrals achieved by posting additional liquidity as a component of future payment deferrals. Our
differentiated deferral strategy provides our customers a runway to resolve their liquidity issues and allow the
appropriate time to recover. Unlike the cookie-cutter big bank approach, we established the expectation that the
burden of responsibility of solving the long-term cash flow problems remains with our client base.
In our gaming book, all borrowers continue to make interest payments as 90-day principal-only deferrals were
approved for 37% of the portfolio. Today, 95% of our clients are open for business and are experiencing a strong
rebound of demand. These facts and the daily conversations with our people and clients help me feel confident
that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively managing our risk segments is bearing fruit
and puts Western Alliance in a strong position to come out on the other side of the pandemic in better shape than
our peers.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Thanks, Ken. Over the last three months, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million or $0.93 per
share. As mentioned, net income was impacted by elevated provision expense for credit losses, driven by the
adoption of CECL in Q1 and changes in the economic outlook during the quarter. Net interest income increased
$29.4 million, primarily as a result of loan growth and lower rates and liabilities as interest expense was cut in half.
Operating non-interest income fell $5.2 million to $11.1 million from the prior quarter as lower levels of financial

activity generated lower – fewer fees. We also benefited from several non-operating items during the period,
including a recovery of approximately 40% or $4.4 million of the mark-to-market loss on preferred stock holdings
we recognized in Q1.
Additionally, bank-owned life insurance was restructured, resulting in an increase of $5.6 million as we
surrendered and reinvested lower yielding policies. In addition to this gain, this should moderately increase full-
year revenue prospectively. Finally, non-interest expense declined $5.7 million primarily from an increase in
deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million related to PPP loan originations, plus a 52% decrease in deposit
costs and a 64% decline in business development and travel expenses.
Strong ongoing balance sheet momentum coupled with diligent expense management drove operating pre-
provision net revenue of $194.7 million was up 27.7% year over year. We believe it's the most relevant metric to
evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the bank. Our strong PPNR covered an 80% increase in provision cost
from Q1 to $92 million, while driving EPS up 12% to $0.93 on a linked-quarter basis.
Turning now to our interest drivers. Investment yields increased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.02%.
However, the overall quarterly portfolio yield decreased by 32 basis points from the prior year due to the lower
rate environment. Loan yields decreased 45 basis points following declines across most loan types, mainly driven
by the 83 basis point reduction in one-month LIBOR during the quarter. Yield reductions were partly offset by an
average yield on our PPP loans of 5.02%. Prospectively, we expect loan yields to trend toward the end-of-quarter
spot rate shown of 4.66%.
Interest-bearing deposit costs fell by 50 basis points in Q2 to 40 basis points, as this quarter received the full
benefit of our proactive steps taken to reduce deposit rates immediately after the FOMC cut rates twice in March.
The spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was 20 basis points. Total funding costs declined by 34 basis points
when all of the company's funding sources are considered, including non-interest-bearing deposits and
borrowings. The spot rate on total funding costs of 31 basis points is higher than the quarterly average due to the
issuance of subordinated debt mid-quarter at 5.25%. We expect funding costs to have stabilized at these levels,
as no further debt actions are anticipated.
Demonstrating the flexibility of our business model, despite a transition to a substantially lower rate environment
during the quarter, net interest income rose 10.9% or $29 million during Q1 to $298.4 million, up 17% year-over-
year. Our origination of PPP loans coupled with strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to
reduce the cost of interest-bearing deposits counteracted the decline in prime and LIBOR. PPP lending supported
our net interest margin during Q2 as SBA fees were recognized, resulting in a loan yield of 5.02% in this sector.
We estimate most of PPP loans will be forgiven within eight months from origination.
Of the $43 million in PPP loan fees we received from the SBA net of origination costs, 1/3 or $13.9 million was
recognized in the second quarter. Net interest margin contracted 3 basis points to 4.19% during the quarter, as
our earning asset yields fell 34 basis points, but was offset by an equal improvement in funding costs. Our
outsized deposit growth and mounting cash reserves will continue to place downward pressure on the NIM until
excess liquidity can be deployed, which we expect will take two to three quarters.
With regards – with our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably over the past – over last year
and we are now asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases, as 70% of our loan portfolio
is behaving as a fixed rate since floors on variable rate loans have largely been triggered. Our estimated net
change of net interest income and a 100 basis point parallel shock higher is 4.2% over the next year, and we now
project zero net interest income at risk if rates move lower.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Turning now to operating efficiency. On a linked-quarter basis, our efficiency ratio improved 550 basis points to
36.3%, which continues to demonstrate our industry-leading operating leverage. As mentioned earlier, the non-
interest expense improvement is related to an increase in deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million and
related PPP loan originations, plus a 52% reduction in deposit costs and a 64% decrease in development and
travel costs. Normalizing for PPP net loan fees and interests, the efficiency ratio for Q2 would have been 38.4%.
Additionally, our branch-light model has given us the flexibility to identify two locations that we are transitioning
from full service offices to loan production facilities.
Our core underlying earnings power remains strong as pre-provision net revenue ROA increased 18 basis points
from the prior quarter to 2.56% and return on assets was flat at 1.22%. While we expect the 2.56% is a high
watermark as elevated liquidity will hold down the margin, we believe we will continue to maintain industry-leading
performance. This provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management
actions or any credit demand. Our balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased
$1.9 billion to $25 billion. And this deposit growth of $2.7 billion brought our deposit balances to $27.5 billion at
quarter end.
The loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 90.9% from 93.3% in Q1, as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us
with balance sheet capacity to meet all funding needs. Our cash position increased to $1.5 billion as deposit
growth continues to outpace credit expansion. While this impairs the margin near term, we believe it provides us
with inventory for good credit growth as demand resumes. Of note, during the quarter, we issued $225 million of
bank-level subordinated debt to ensure ample capacity to support our growth trajectory by bolstering our total
capital ratio.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $1.11 over the prior quarter to $27.84, an increase of $3.19 or
13% over the prior year. The vast majority of the $1.9 billion in loan growth was driven by increases in C&I loans
of $1.6 billion, residential loans of $154 million and construction loans of $138 million. Residential and consumer
loans now comprise 9.8% of our loan portfolio, while our construction loan concentration continues to trend
downward and is now at 8.8% of total loans. Excluding PPP loans, loan growth was $170 million, which was
affected by line pay-downs from draws during Q1 and offset by growth in residential and construction.
Highlighting our continued focus on growth and low-risk assets, tech and innovation loans were flat in total, while
within the category capital call and subscription lines grew $35 million. Mortgage warehouse loans grew $325
million and residential mortgages grew $165 million. Corporate finance loans decreased $233 million compared to
the increase we saw in Q1, as borrowers repaid their line draws reducing utilization rates down from 38% to 17%.
And our loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth. We continue to believe our ability to profitably grow
deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our firm's long-term value creation.
Notably, year-to-date deposit growth of $6.1 billion is higher than the annual deposit growth of the company in any
previous calendar year. Deposits grew $2.7 billion or 10.9% in the second quarter, driven by increases in
noninterest-bearing DDAs of $2.3 billion, which now comprise over 44% of our deposit base. PPP loan-related
deposits grew $1.1 billion, and savings and money market accounts were up $845 million. HOA has contributed to
total deposit growth by adding $136 million. And tech and innovation increased $262 million as capital raising
activity during the quarter was active. Excluding PPP-related deposits, growth would have been $1.6 billion or
6.5%.
Regarding asset quality, special mention loans increased $292 million, and non-performing loans rose $53 million
during the quarter. One-half of the increase in SM loans are from the hotel portfolio, generally consistent with our
6

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
previously-discussed tech and innovation rating guidelines. These loans were downgraded, as we do not have
clear line of sight to more than six months of remaining operating liquidity. These borrowers are current, however,
as they made loan prepayments that will be required for us to consent to a deferral modification. Our other
borrowers in this segment are also paying as agreed or providing cash payments that when coupled with the
payment deferral have no additional debt service requirement until sometime in 2021.
Second, we've aggregated an event planning and leisure sub-segment, in which the business models are
essentially dependent on social distancing relief and, in some cases, the resumption of group events. Of the $150
million total exposure to this sector, $60 million has been moved to special mention and $40 million to non-
performing. While portion moved to SM has over a year of current liquidity, it was downgraded as the revenue
models have been sharply impaired. The loan move to non-performing has had – now has limited remaining
liquidity. The remainder of the migration to special mention is fairly granular from our client spreads throughout
our metropolitan markets where liquidity has been tightened. These loans are generally collateralized by an array
of assets that include real property.
Frequently, a loan may be downgraded to SM because of liquidity concerns, even though collateral coverage may
be considerable. For this reason, migration to special mention has a low correlation to ultimate credit losses as,
over the past five years, less than 1% has moved through to charge-offs. Our allowance for credit losses rose $86
million during the quarter, as the change in mix of the balance sheet released $4.2 million of reserves and
changes to the outlook accounted for $96.2 million, including covering $5.5 million of net charge-offs.
Revisions to the CECL macroeconomic outlook assumptions, which have declined since March 31 but have
generally stabilized since April, accounted for the entire net reserve build. The [indiscernible] (00:22:40) allowance
related to loan losses was $347 million, excluding held-to-maturity securities or 1.39% of funded loans, an
increase of 25 basis points. The current reserve build reflects our best estimate of the future economic
environment as of quarter end, including the impact of government stimulus programs and credit migration
actions. We have migrated to a consensus economic outlook of blue chip economic forecasts as it tracks largely
management's view of the recession and recovery.
Net credit losses of $5.5 million were recognized during the quarter, which were mainly attributable to small
business and C&I borrowers. In all, total loan ACL to funded loans increased 25 basis points to 1.39% in Q2, as
provision expense for loans losses of $87.3 million significantly outpaced net loan charge-offs. Relative to most
other banking companies, our lower consumer exposure continues to result in lower total loan losses.
I'll now turn the call back to Ken.

Thanks, Dale. I would now like to briefly update you on the current status of a few exposures to the industries
generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the last two weeks of the
quarter, Tim Bruckner, the credit administration team and I conducted the most extensive quarterly portfolio
review process in the bank's history. The review covered 95% of WAL's outstanding loan balances, excluding
purchase residential mortgages. Our $2 billion Hotel Franchise Finance business focused on select-service hotels
represents approximately 8.2% of the loan portfolio. The financial flexibility of these borrowers is maximized by
working with financially strong institutional operating partners with deep industry experience, expertise and
conservative underwriting structures focused on loan-to-cost.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Occupancy rates are tracking national averages currently around 46%, which have tripled compared to the lows in
April of around 15% and are now only a few percentage points short of fully covering estimated operating
expenses. At approximately 55% occupancy, select-service hotels are also estimated to cover amortizing debt
service. As a testament to the operating models of the select-service hotels, revenue per available room has
fallen 55%, but they have been able to shrink their cost structure by over 40%. And as a result, the typical hotel is
operating at breakeven.
Nearly 85% of our hotel portfolio is either paying as originally agreed or on a proactive payment deferral plans that
bridge into 2021. We feel positive about the trajectory of the portfolio and that our proactive deferral strategy will
produce relatively stronger credit performance, given the active support of our sponsors have demonstrated
through the material upfront payments made to receive deferral plans. To augment the strategy, we nearly
doubled the reserve of the portfolio this quarter and increased the ACL-to-loans ratio by 93 basis points to 1.95%.
The investor-dependent portion of our Technology & Innovation segment is primarily focused on lending to
establish growth companies with successful products and strong investor support, which provides greater
operating and financial flexibility in this environment. Overall, a significant sponsor support and an active
fundraising environment continue for these growth firms. 81% of loans have greater than six months remaining
months' liquidity, up from 77% in Q1. Additionally, we have had over 50 clients successfully raise over $1.4 billion
in new capital since March 1.
Our $509 million gaming book is focused on off-strip, middle market gaming-linked companies whose revenue is
driven by local demand factors. 37% of the portfolio use our 90-day principal-only payment deferral as they
continue to cover interest payments. Additionally, these clients benefited from $28.4 million of PPP loans.
Inclusive of our recent closure mandates in Nevada to limit certain business activities, businesses representing
95% of the portfolio are open for operations. Upon reopening, all casinos borrowers are performing at or above
their COVID operating plan and no loans were downgraded to criticize or classify at quarter end.
Lastly, our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform as 99% of our industrial leases are current. 90%
of our office rents are paid, on par with the national average. The sub-segment of CRE that is showing signs of
stress for the industry is retail. WAL's CRE retail exposure of $676 million is focused on local, personal service-
based retail strip centers with limited merchandise retail exposure. Similar to HFF, we are utilizing deferrals to
support a path to recovery for these borrowers, while requiring demonstrated sponsor support with high level of
additional payment reserves. Of note, 67% of WAB's investor CRE retail tenants paid May's rent payments
compared to 50% nationally.
We continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common
equity to total assets of 8.9% and a common Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, an increase of 20 basis points during the
quarter. Excluding PPP loans, TCE to tangible assets was flat from Q1 at 9.4%. Inclusive of our quarterly cash
dividend payment of 25% per share, our tangible book value per share rose $1.11 in the quarter to $27.84, an
increase of 12.9% in the past year. We continue to grow our tangible book value per share at a rate significantly
faster than our peers, as it has increased 3 times that of our peers over the last 5.5 years.
In conclusion, we expect loan growth to be fairly flat in Q3, as PPP pay-offs and forgivenesses are largely offset
by the organic growth in low risk asset classes. Depending on the timing of the realized PPP forgiveness, organic
loan growth should offset PPP runoff resulting in net loan growth being relatively stable. We anticipate another
strong quarter of deposit growth in Q3, primarily by executing on our deposit initiatives and achieving our market
share gains in mortgage warehouse. The anticipated deposit growth and resulting liquidity will primarily be
deployed into residential mortgage assets to improve returns on cash over the next several quarters. However, as
8

PPP loans roll off and liquidity continues to rise, pressure on NIM will also continue until it can be fully deployed
into productive assets. While we are pleased with our deposit growth, the pace is exceeding loan growth. And as
Dale mentioned, it will take several quarters to redeploy this liquidity into low-risk loans or assets providing yields
greater than the Fed's current offering.
Operating PPNR is expected to decline modestly, as PPP income begins to abate, loan balances growth – grow
begin – growth begins to reignite and the deployment of excess liquidity continues and deferral of loan origination
costs return to normal levels. Our long-term asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic
consensus forecast, which should – consistent going forward should preclude material increases in reserve levels
from this point. The pace, timing and size of future net charge-offs are uncertain to us, as we have not seen a
material increase in delinquencies or substandard migration. Finally, our strong capital base and access to ample
liquidity will allow us to both take advantage of any market dislocations to grow in low-risk areas and to address
any credit demands in the future.
At this time, Dale, Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]
The first question today comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So, first question, on the hotel book, the deferral strategy of you guys there looks it's more than six months. Can
you just give us some color on what the average term is and how far in advance have you guys deferred these?
And then, what is – the occupancy sounds like it is near sort of breakeven levels. What is in your reserve build
forecast going forward? Do you have it reaching 50 – reaching that 55% level? Just some color there, given that
this obviously is of concern.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I think the Hotel Franchise Finance book of business is the most misunderstood. And our approach is not
fully understood as well. So, let me take a half step backwards and give you a larger picture of – as to what we're
doing and why we're doing it and then get directly to your questions there, Casey.
One, the first misconception is deferrals are a good thing, okay? Payment deferrals require cash collateral or pay-
down of debt upfront. They prove or provide liquidity to the project. They show from the borrower's point of view
9


Western Alliance Bancorporation
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
project commitment which is very important or they flush out any early problems we need to deal with. So, when
we say we have a six-plus-six program, what that means is our borrower gave us six months of payments upfront
that we deposited into a bank account which we pull out on a monthly basis as debt service coverage ratio – debt
service coverage is due that are paid principal and interest, I should say, is due and they don't get to their six-
month deferral process until six months from today. So, that's what six plus six means, all right? And what we're
trying to do here as we look for people who provide the liquidity and commit to the projects, again, it helps us
understand if they do not want to do those things, then we need to take fast action to preserve the 40% of equity
that's sitting in front of our debt. That is the philosophy around our approach.
A specific answer to your question today, about 51% of our portfolio is in the six-plus-six deferral bucket, 19% is in
the three-plus-three bucket, about 9% is in the as paid as agreed and another 3% is in the three-plus-six bucket.
And then, we've got a whole bunch of other plans, five plus five, two plus two, all those type of plans depending
on the particular borrower. And that amounts to about 10%. So, all in, about 92% of our hotel book is paying as
agreed or is on a deferral program. Now, we [ph] saw of about 6% (00:34:57) that were in the process of
documenting and we expect that to fall into any one of the buckets I just described. But all in, overall, 99% of our
hotel book is paying as agreed, even if they're on a deferral because we are attaching those funds that are sitting
at a bank account where they provided the liquidity upfront.
The other specific question you ask is – let me just give you some of the numbers here. For us, the current
occupancy is about 43%, 44%. That is three times higher than the lows in March. The ADR is $44. That, too, is
three times higher than March. We did say, at 45%, based on our book of business here, that the company is
breakeven on an operating basis. And at 55%, the company does begin – or the book of business does begin to
cash flow on a one-to-one ratio, inclusive of amortization, okay? I think that addressed all of your questions.

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I would add a couple of things. It's Tim Bruckner. First, I'd say this was not the easiest thing to execute. I don't
want to downplay that. The – this took a concerted effort of our people. And initial discussions with borrowers
were difficult because we're solving for a period significantly longer than most viewed COVID in the first 90 days
of the crisis. And so, we went out from the start and said, let's solve for periods sufficient to return to stabilization.
And that's what we did and we solved that not just with our money and our deferral, but with contributions from
our very significant sponsorship in that space. We did it because it was the right thing to do. Our borrowers did it
because they could do it. And I think that's a very important point on this. And we have so many now that come
back and say, I'm so glad that we took this approach.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

2021, sorry. Another 20% or so we'll deal with towards the end of the year, okay? So, we've given enough of a
runway here. This was the most important thing that we can do to help our clients is to give them a long runway to
come back up to the operating levels that they previously experienced. Initially, as Tim said, they resisted. But
once they talked to us, once they saw what was happening, they saw some of the wisdom in the approach that
we deployed.
Casey, did I answer your questions there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, yeah, yeah – no, that was pretty comprehensive. I'll have to go back and reread it myself. But that was [ph]
fabulous (00:38:06). Dale, a question for you on the NIM. Slide 6, by my math, on the spot rates, it looks like it's
about – it exited the quarter at 3.90%. Just – does that sound about right, number one? And then, number two,
what is that loan yield spot rate of 4.66%? What does that presume for the PPP loans? At 5.02% in the quarter –
on 2Q, that's a lot higher than what we've seen from peers. So, just some color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, that assumes 5.02% for the quarter as well. So, what we did in terms of recognizing PPP revenue is
we've estimated doing the effective interest method and GAAP how long are these loans going to last. And from
information what we have and what our borrowers are thinking and how they're behaving, we think the average
life of these is going to be about eight months. And so, we're taking the PPP average loan fee which is about
2.7%. And we're recognizing 2/3 of that really over this eight month. And then, there's a tail for the part that might
not pay off. So, you should expect us to show something of a level loan yield on the PPPs and I think some other
are doing maybe a little different approach.
I would hope that our number would be on the higher side of where you are in the higher 3s for the quarter. But
frankly, it kind of remains to be seen a bit. I mean, we've had this massive increase in core deposits. We think that
we're on track for another strong quarter of core deposit growth in the third quarter, while the loan balances won't
be moving as much because we're dealing with the pay-downs on PPP as we originate credit in other high-quality
categories. So, that's going to help us in terms of inventory build, but it doesn't help us in terms of the NIM. But we
think that's going to be really important in 2021.

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, just wanted to make sure I understand the PPPs on a go-forward basis. $1.9 billion of loans should imply
$57 million in gross fees. I think you mentioned that net of the – net of origination costs, you had about $43 million
less. You recognized about $14 million this quarter. Can you help me understand with the geography of where
some of those fees will show up in terms of NII versus a reduction in operating expenses going forward? I mean, I
think you'll get to the same place overall, but maybe starting from a little lower point than I thought?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. That's – I think that's probably the biggest delta. So, we did $1 billion – or just under $1.9 billion, $1.860
billion in loans. We had some people surrender at a couple of early pays. And so, that number is down to about
$1.7 billion today. We received fees of $49 million from the SBA, now $57 million. And then, we netted certain
costs against that and that's how we get to the $43 million. Going forward, I'm not looking for any cost release
obviously because the origination process has ended. But I'm not looking for – but so the $3.3 million that we
highlighted in the release, yeah, I think that's going to come back up in compensation expense. So, that is going
to rise again. And then, the remaining – so, that gets to a net $43 million. We took 1/3 of that in the second
quarter. We'll probably going to take another 1/3 of that in the third quarter and then we're going to have a tail end
to the fourth and maybe a dribble down a little bit into the first of next year in terms of the kind of recognition. So, I
think, two things. One is maybe the dollar amount was a little bit higher because some of these were very short
term or refunded; and then, two, the average loan fee was shy of 3%. It was about 2.7%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So, bottom line, you still got $29 million to recognize. Most of that's going to come through net interest
income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
That will all come through net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Got it. Understood. And then, just to follow up on the margin. You noted in the deck you've got 78% of the
loan book essentially acting at a fixed rate. Thus far, I mean, I know it's early. But how challenging has it been
able to defend some of those floors? Obviously, there's probably now a lot of loans moving from bank to bank
right now. So, just kind of curious kind of your thoughts on being able to defend those loan floors as we kind of
move through the year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Yeah. Actually, it has been less challenging than it has been in other downward environments. And I would tell
you that today – and this is unusual. I mean, two to three years ago, when we put on a loan with a floor, we'd
have – the loan docs are in there and of course is disclosed and discussed with the borrower. But it triggers 25 to
50 basis points below the variable rate. And so, it's like, oh, it's a little bit of an afterthought it's probably not going
to hit me, most people don't think loans or rates are going to plummet as they did. Today, that's not the case.
Today, how we are reducing our rate is it's usually at a LIBOR floor assumption of 1%. Well, LIBOR is under 120
basis points today. So, we did go in knowing, okay, this loan is priced at L plus 325 and L is never considered to
be below 1. So, out of the gate, the floors looks active and it's going to be active for – until LIBOR gets above 1
and then we can go to a variable rate structure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Surprisingly, we're not losing business because of the floors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, final question, just looking through some of the segment data. I did notice there was a – look like
a negative provision in the other NBL category. In the quarter, that reserve actually went down. Any color there,
kind of, relative to kind of what you did with the rest of the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. It's not so much a portfolio thing is that when we updated for the CECL outlook and the migration from Mark
Zandi's analysis to a consensus forecast, it resulted in different allocations for certain sectors. And C&I loans in
particular kind of came down in part in that regard.

Operator: The next question today comes from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe we can start on the credit migration into special mention this quarter. It certainly didn't seem like that was
the primary reason for the second quarter provision. I guess, looking ahead, how should we thing about future
credit migration relative to the current allowance? If there's future migration in the special mention, is that already
13


Western Alliance Bancorporation
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
pretty much included in the existing expectations? And I guess, more specifically, if there's migration out of
special mention and into classified, would that drive incremental necessity to build allowance from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, as I kind of alluded to, the loss rates for SM loans does not have a high correlation in terms of migration
and that's reflected in our formulas. We don't see that in the math and in the emergence of loss. And so, migration
to SM is usually driven by a liquidity question. So, even if we had a loan that was at a 20% loan to value but
there's a liquidity tightening going on at that borrower, that's going to go to SM even though the risk of loss most
people would say will be essentially zero. So, in terms of what could migrate to SM, I think we kind of highlighted
that we thought we'd see some SM migration in the hotel book, because they're under liquidity stress as those –
as the occupancy rates really dropped in that quarter. Now, if you go from there to classified or to nonperforming,
it has become a different category and those loss assumptions do generally climb. When we moved to a classified
asset, we're going to look at the collateral behind it and we're going to recognize a reserve based upon are we
under water or not relative to expectation. So that could be a different result. But SM migration really has almost
no effect on provisioning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe switching to the technology portfolio, certainly encouraging to
see that over 50 clients, over $1 billion was raised in the quarter. I'm looking specifically at the 14% of tech loans
last quarter that had under six months of liquidity. Were those included in that $1.4 billion of capital raising
activity? And I guess those companies that are coming up to that kind of a deadline, are they having as easy
success raising incremental rounds? And what's happening to the valuations if they are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, some of that money was raised for those customers that were in SM last quarter that were able to raise
their – raise liquidity and then move out. That's a constant number that kind of moves in and moves out. Relatively
speaking, the tech and innovation book stayed relatively flat in terms of the SM movement. So that was very
encouraging to me, because it means that the investors are continuing to be confident in the projects or
investments they've made and are continuing to put capital into their companies. So I hope that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I would add just – Tim Bruckner. Quarter-over-quarter, we actually saw improvements in businesses with RML
less than six months if you look quarter one to quarter two. And so, what we're seeing is a high level of activity. In
some cases, the rounds are smaller. But we're seeing sustained sponsor support and really strong activity in the
sector. So quarter-over-quarter RML licensing improved Q1 to Q2.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I'll give you two pieces of interesting facts about our book for the tech and innovation. The medium equity
invested in our portfolios is 6 times our loan commitment today and it is 10.6 times the current outstanding loan
balance. So, it gives you a sense of how much equity is going into the companies and also of the fact that even
though we give a commitment, about half of that commitment is not drawing down on at all because they have so
14

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
much equity. And that leads us to why we have 2 to 2.5 times depending on what time of the year you look at
deposits to loans in the tech and innovation business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then, in the gaming book, I guess, I'm kind of surprised to see the level of allowance allocated to that
portfolio relative to currently adversely graded loans. Is that an indication that things could still get choppy in the
future? Or is that formulaic as it didn't seem like there was much expected lost content from your prepared
remarks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, first, we have no Las Vegas trip exposure, okay, and we mostly have drive to and local markets. And
what's interesting here is they are outperforming the same period of 2019 in their initial re-openings. So, May
2020 was better than May 2019, all right? We do have one or two properties where they're just performing at
COVID [ph] plan (00:50:55) and that is not – that's the worst that we can say and we're pretty happy about that.
Some of our gaming establishments are posting win per day at their slot machines that are three times the normal
average level, all right? So, in this book, we have – 36% of the book has had an interest-only deferral. We have
not had any principal deferrals. Part of what you see in our calculation is manually driven by the model. Of course,
there are some subjective input put in on top, overlays for what we think is occurring in our book of business. But
our book has a fairly strong or I should say lower leverage than you think. Generally, the leverage in our book is
just under 3 times debt to EBITDA.
You go back to the last prices. And anything over a – or under 4.5 to 5 times debt to EBITDA had a 90% survival
rate. So, right now, we like our book is doing well. We are encouraged that there is a return here by our gaming
clients' customers. And I also think it shows well for that when the economy opens up again how quickly people
want to come back out and socialize and be in settings with other people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I mean, I think part of what you're referring to, Timur, is basically the process of using formulas that were
developed during the financial crisis and extrapolating them to today, which has a different circumstance and a
different underwriting and a different kind of risk profile entirely. With 95% of our properties open and what we're
seeing in the low LTV we are in this sector, I would put my bet that, when we're done with this pandemic and we
look past – look backward in terms of what happened, the ACL in this sector will have been shown to be higher
than it needed to be.

Christopher McGratty Q

Great. Thanks for the question. Dale or Ken, just wanted to go back to loan growth for a second. I completely
understand the near-term, low-risk growth strategy and PPP dynamic perhaps should last a couple of quarters.
I'm wondering kind of your thoughts on how we should be thinking about loan growth beyond maybe the next
couple of quarters and remind us kind of the targets that you're setting forth for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, it'll be somewhat stable to where we are now when you
consider the runoff of the PPP as Dale talked about being replaced by our traditional organic loan growth. As we
16


Western Alliance Bancorporation
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
emerge out of Q4, we haven't done our full planning yet. But I would think that it's going to be no less than what
we normally do which is $600 million to $800 million per quarter. Right now, I am encouraged that our pipeline is
beginning to build. And I arrived at that conclusion by looking at the number of loans that come into our senior
loan committee, all right? Those are the largest loans in the bank. They're coming in with from what I'll call brand
name companies that you would know very well at better terms, okay, and at better pricing. And so, we are
encouraged by that right now that we have to wait for those loans to be approved and we have to of course wait
for them to be drawn down. But as we emerge out of Q4, I would think we're back to our normal run rate of $600
million to $800 million a quarter and we'll update you as we get closer into Q4 as we normally do for the next year
outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I think this is going to firstly depend upon what happens to the situation. I mean, I've been encouraged by what
seems to be a number of firms worldwide that claim to have an efficacious vaccine. And if that's the case and if
that is a rollout, around the end of this year maybe into Q1, I think that puts confidence in a different level and I
think we'd have the background and we're ready with the infrastructure and we've got the deposit capacity that
we'll be able to take advantage of an increase in demand as confidence resumes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. Dale, in terms of deposits, so it sounds like loan growth [indiscernible] (00:57:02) until the end of the
year and then resumption. The comments about deposit growth just coming in, if I take out the PPP of $1.1 billion,
you still grew $1.5 billion or so in the quarter. Can you just help us with the magnitude of what you're likely to see
in Q3 and Q4? Just how big is the balance sheet going to be, I guess, I'm trying to get my arms around.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, it's not going to replicate what we did in the first half of the year. But we're getting traction in our specialty
business lines. We're getting traction in mortgage warehouse. We're getting traction in homeowner associations
and we're getting traction in tech place. And all of those have demonstrated historical momentum and the queue
is good for what we're seeing coming in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And then, if I could sneak one last one in. I just want to make sure I got the expense outlook right. So, the
deposit cost came down to 3.5%. Is that the right run rate that we should be using from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A

I think that's fair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, the moving piece is with the PPP comp. How do we think about just the overall expense, the
expenses you were kind of flat quarter-on-quarter. But I know you're making some investments. But any kind of
direction of expenses?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I mean, we're at $115 million that included a credit for PPP originations. Of course, we're not doing any
more PPP originations. And as you mentioned, we're going to be fairly flattish with pay-downs from that program
and expectation of asset development elsewhere. So, I don't think we're going to be below 40% on efficiency for
long. And I'm not sure we're going to go right back to 42. I think that may be a little but I don't think there are many
quarters that begin with a 3. As we see that come back, I mean, some of the expenses we saved, travel
expenses, business development, that's really kind of the circumstance that we're in today. We do think that travel
[ph] helps – will help things (00:59:04) close deals. We think it – and so, we're going to get back into that when
that's feasible from a social distancing and state regulation scenario allows. So, yeah, we're going to be back. And
so, I wouldn't look at the $115 million, I'd look more at the $120 million where we were before in terms of
something closer to our run rate.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for the question. Wanted to follow up first on the reserve, I think that's gotten a lot of attention and
had a lot of questions about it. I'm trying to get to a more comparable figure to maybe other banks if we kind of
backed out mortgage warehouse and maybe the large resi mortgage purchase portfolio and PPP loans and I think
you guys might be more on par with other banks. But I didn't know if there is a way to kind of disaggregate that
where we could maybe see it on a more comparable basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. This is talking our own book a little bit. But when you think through our loan loss reserve and compare it to
other banks, first, we always recognize that we don't have a consumer franchise and that's where a lot of losses
will begin to mount. That's number one. Number two, I break our book into loan categories where we've had no
losses, resource finance for $900 million, capital call lines $500 million, HOA services $300 million, warehouse
lending $2.9 billion. That's $4.5 billion that we've never had a loss yet. Then, we've got another $4 billion where
we've had limited losses in residential loans – our consumer muni loans and nonprofit, that too adds up to about
$4 billion. So, as you think about our funnel of $25 billion, you can take roughly $8 billion almost off the top for
either no or low losses.
Now, of course, you're not going to do that. But I think you can add a small percentage of basis points to cover
your losses against that $8 billion and then recalculate the reserve ratio and I think you'll find that it will rise
considerably above the 1.24%. Another thing that I think is helpful for you to think through when you look at our
book and this is how we look at it. Our construction land and development, which is about $2.2 billion, the book
there is looking very strong and it is responding and acting differently than the prior cycle. First, we have about 1/3
of that book sitting in [indiscernible] (01:01:52) banking, all right? And in [indiscernible] (01:01:56) banking, we
have an LTV of about 55% with a well-capitalized highly liquid sponsors, i.e. private equity or hedge funds that are
backed that are our guarantors here. So, that book of business is performing very well. We have no deferrals
18


Western Alliance Bancorporation
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
there. And in fact, instead of getting deferral requests, we're getting just the opposite. We're getting incoming
calls, people saying you don't have to worry about me paying my bill, but you have to be there when I see
opportunities. And that's an easy thing for us to say, if you're making your payments as agreed to, based on the
terms that we'd usually use, we'll be there to help you.
So, the CLD book is somewhat different, too. And then, on top of this – and I know people like to go back and say,
wow, what happened to Western Alliance in 2008, in 2009 and 2010 and draw from that some type of regression
analysis. But when you look at the prior cycle, the credit physics, if you will, from the prior cycle to where we are
today are completely different, almost a full turnaround. So, in the prior cycle, you had high unemployment, okay,
that phase where we are today. But the prior cycle, you had high unemployment, high delinquencies, high charge-
offs, low home prices, you had a rising supply of home prices, you had income dropping and you had demand
dropping for these homes as well.
In the current cycle, yes, employment is higher than the prior cycle. But you don't see the rise in delinquencies,
you're not seeing the rise in charge-offs, home prices are either flat to rising, supply has not grown and income –
with the help of fiscal policies by the government, income has risen and demand is higher. So, when we look at
the appropriate reserve for construction, land and development book, we had to put all these overlays on top of
the historic modeling that you would see in order to represent what we see happening in our book of business
today. So, you put that together, you also acknowledge that we have no energy loans, we have limited restaurant
loans, we have very few solar loans. All that stuff collectively together got us to our reserve calculation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
That makes sense. And just as we move forward, I mean, the main thing that would drive a big delta in the
reserve would be losses in some of those historically low loss categories. Is that kind of the right way to think
about that? Or would it be the more significant downgrades in other categories that have had historical losses in
the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I mean, effectively, we're in a scenario that you pay losses as incurred, right? Your ACL covers what's still in
the book out there. Now, if we had – or if we had a loss in the category that previously has been zero loss and we
expected it to have zero, that would inform the analysis and the expectation of loss and what's still out there and,
gosh, maybe you got that wrong. Maybe there was a defect in what you're doing there that is embedded in other
loans. And so, in that sense, it could drive a higher provision. But for the most part, it's almost pay as you go and
sustain your level of reserve based upon your outstanding balance and changes in the outlook of the economy.

Okay. And maybe just one last follow-up. I think you guys have outlined a lot of detail on some of the most in-
focus loan segments. But are there any other sort of tangential categories that we should have on our radar
screen, maybe C&I relationship or something that might be related to one of the underlying categories just that we
should be thinking about or that should be addressed?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Yeah. I think that's a fair question. And inside of our CRE book, we have three components to it. We have
industrial. And there, 99% of our borrowers' customers are paying their rent. We feel comfortable there. We have
office. There, 90% of our borrowers' customers are paying rent – rate, but we have a CRE book for retail, about
$700 million – just a touch over $700 million. There, 66% of our borrowers' customers are paying rent compared
to a 50% national average. Now, I'm not saying there's a problem there. But you asked what are we focusing on
and what has our elevated attention today. That is an area that has our elevated attention. We don't have to move
quickly on it. We're watching it. It has – it's got a very strong debt service coverage ratio coming into the downturn
of 1.8 times. It has a very low LTV of 48%. We don't have much speculative loans there at all. So, I'm not – I want
to make sure I'm clear. Don't run away saying there was a problem. You asked where we're also watching. That is
an area that we're watching.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. My first question is on the mechanics of the deferral program. If we use the six-and-six program as an
example, so the first six months, they're accruing interest, you pull the P&I from the accounts that they deposited
in, everything's normal. But after the first six months, as we get into 2021, what happens to those loans in terms of
the treatment of it? Do they go on non-accrual? Or do they move to special mention or classified? I'm just curious
as to whether or not they'll continue to accrue interest in the second half of the deferral period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah – no. So, the loan docs have been modified. And so, the contractual payments now allow for that. There's
no new payment done – due until, I'm going to say, May of 2021. So, you're right. I mean, we take the six months
they paid upfront of P&I and then we debit that and we recognize that liability and we pay paid the loan down over
that six months. Then, for the next six months, what we do is payment regarding principal is deferred and interest
payments that otherwise would have been due are now tacked on to principal due usually at the end of the
maturity of the loan, could be earlier, could be a year out or two years out or something like that where that's
going to become due again. So, we're going to continue to accrue income and increase effectively the balance on
that loan for the next six months. It doesn't move to any classification unless we have information that there's
another problem with the situation that has since developed. But otherwise, it would stay like that. And then, after
that expires, then they're back to their standard P&I payments as originally agreed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I might – it's Tim Bruckner. I would add one – just one thing on the interrelationship of our strategy and risk rating,
because I don't want this point to be missed. We – one, it's not – that's not a direct relationship. Is the deferral in
effect or not does not directly affect the risk rating, the weekly dialogue with our borrower and verification of
liquidity to work through that plan. That is the important calculus in our risk rating methodology. So, all the time,
we're in constant and ongoing dialogue with the borrower, ensuring that they're closing the gap and that there's
sufficient liquidity through this cycle. So, if we get to a point where those mechanics change and we feel
differently about that, that's when we would affect the risk rating. I want to be clear on it.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And then, shifting gears to the provision. As we think about the third quarter and clearly, there's a
lot of uncertainty on the macro outlook, but if we were to assume the macro outlook is stable from here, you
mentioned about how you're expecting flat or low loan growth, what would that translate to in terms of
provisioning? Are we thinking back towards – I mean, I don't want to be too optimistic and think of 2019 levels.
But what should we – how should we think about provisioning over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, yeah, I wouldn't go back to 2019 either. But I would think that it would fall off fairly significantly. And that is,
as you saw this quarter, I mean, the entire reserve increase in provision resulted from a deterioration in the
outlook from March 27 to the last – Mark Zandi deal in the first quarter to where we are today. So, if that's fairly
stable as I'm – we'll be maybe as a bit of a pay as you go in terms of losses. So, if we incurred losses, we're going
to recognize that if we have migration downward not into SM but into substandard and into nonperforming, that
could trigger additional provisioning requirements and charge-offs. But other than that, if charge-offs don't really
materialize, I think that number could drop rather dramatically actually over time.

Operator: The next question will come from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Dale, how did you kind of thread the needle with the –
especially in the hotel book, the restructuring – or the deferral that you've structured especially the longest term
ones out to mid-2021? How is that not a TDR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, so the kind of the special dispensation that came out from the FRB extended that window a little bit. So,
prior to that rule change, banks could essentially do a 90-day deferral on anything without having it fall into a
restructuring. So, if there's some temporary hardship, you can basically dole out over the life of a loan one 90-day
push out. And that's been the case, gosh, since I've been doing this for decades. What they allow is that you
could instead for this – for credits that have been impaired by the pandemic, you can double that and you can
take it six months. And so, that's all we've done is we've said, okay, well, that's – we can do six months. So we will
allow the longest you can go and not have it fall into a restructuring situation and then – but then, they're paying
again. So, the amount of time that they go on a deferral is within that window and within the guideline that was
allowed. Because even though it's a year, they've prepaid six months of it.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Yeah. There is a – Brock, Ken here. There is a difference between a solution to how we bridge the gap over the
next year with them versus the deferral part. So the solution is, for a year, the deferral is six months of that year
and the other six months they give us the cash upfront.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it, got it. Okay. And any more color on that negative – the negative provision, you touched on it in one of the
earlier questions and the one of the national businesses and I think there is a $2.1 million in the HOA business. It
seemed just unusual timing this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, yeah. So, again, I mean, we go through this process and when we have all these multiple regressions and
then you come back and you look at it, say, okay, is this helpful? Are we learning something about this? Or is
something kind of overstated? Well, the HOA loan portfolio is quite small. And so, it had been in kind of a
separate category caught up in C&I loans. Well, when you look at the HOA loans on a standalone basis, the idea
that they're going to have loss behavior anything like a C&I loan or that kind of risk profile is really overstated. I
don't know. I'm sure there's somebody somewhere, I don't know anyone that's ever lost a dollar in an HOA loan.
Because when you make an HOA loan, if the HOA becomes delinquent, you get to jump in front of the first
position lender on whichever house it is in that HOA that's delinquent.
So, if I don't pay my HOA fees and that causes my HOA association to not pay, they can come after me and
[indiscernible] (01:15:41) in front of my first mortgage. So, your LTV on that loan is less than 1%. I mean, that's
just ridiculous. That's just going to sit there forever. So, you get your money eventually. And so, a loss rate really
on HOA loans should be darn near zero. The reason why it wasn't originally is because it was embedded in large
– in a larger group of C&I loans, because it was so small, highlighted that change and addressed it with
segmenting that particular target.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on the hotel deferral strategy. Ken, I think you mentioned
that you had some sponsors basically coming to you and saying, I'm glad we did it this way, the six-plus-six. That
said, I'm sure they all would have happily taken a six-month deferral without paying six months of accelerated
cash. So, how can you be confident that kind of post-COVID there is not any negative fallout in terms of business
or relationship with some of these sponsors with the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Okay. I think that's a fair question. 66% of our book is with large sponsors. And those are sponsors with 25 or
more hotels and they generally deal with about 88% of their book is all connected to the top brands, the Marriott,

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
the Hiltons, the Hyatts, right? And what they have seen from us is our deep knowledge of the industry. And
people like working with other folks that have an understanding of the knowledge of the industry.
I'm going to move to a different group for a second to highlight this as well. We are gaining a lot of share in
warehouse lending. One of the most, if I had to pinpoint the most familiar reason why we're getting new
customers is because our new customers are telling us that some of their incumbent banks don't understand the
space the way we do and they don't want to be dependent upon a lender that doesn't understand the space and
may do something irrational, all right?
So, back to hotel, we don't – we didn't do anything that was irrational. We actually started with the relationship
very early by saying, you always need to have a lot of equity in this relationship. That's the first thing. We then
worked through the models. Of course, we make sure there's the right debt service coverage ratio, make sure
they have the right NOI margins, make sure they've got a model that works in downtimes and you're seeing that
now. You're seeing the model work in downtimes as our customers are able to lower their ADR and take market
share from the lower brands, all right, and move that market share to their hotels, because people would like to go
to a nicer hotel for a lower price, all right?
Now, all of those things connected together indicate that our customers like working with us and they know that
we understand that market. And I think what you're going to see here – and this will play out over time. So, you
can ask me this question six months or nine months from now, assuming that the economy is returning to normal.
I think you're going to see a lot of our smaller competitors that just do one or two hotels here and there, smaller
banks, I think they're going to lose business to us, because over the long term, I think our clients want to deal with
someone that know how to grow. And by the way, we're still in business. We're not shutting down lending. Okay.
We're not doing any right now because there are no deals. But we have told our clients, if you've got a good deal,
if you have an opportunity, we're there to finance you if you are working with us and showing commitment to your
existing projects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I call this tough love because I don't think – they didn't like it to begin with but I think it's – I think we've kind of
earned some respect from some of them and the large majority of our borrowers have resources that are here for
the long-haul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Think of it this way. There comes to a certain point where your kids think you're smart and all of a sudden your
kids think you're really dumb and then they return to say, boy, how did my dad and mom get so smart again?
Well, I think this is what you're going to see with our clients. They're going to say, gee, we didn't agree with this
approach at first. But you know what? These guys had a smart approach to this and it was a differentiated
approach. And what was interesting that people don't understand is it put our clients in front of us to talk to us, all
right, before the other banks even had a conversation. So, a lot of these other banks did a 90-day, open-ended
deferral, cookie cutter you got it, I'll see you in 90 days. We came in with a solution. We said, wait a minute. You
have a bigger problem – we have a bigger problem. The industry has a bigger problem. The economy has a
bigger problem. This is our viewpoint. This is why we see – this is how we see it playing out. And good or bad, at
least, they can respond to your viewpoint and your vision of tomorrow and how you want to solve for it.
