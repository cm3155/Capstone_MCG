President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Miles, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter and full
year 2023 earnings before turning the call over to Dale, who will review our financial results in more detail. After I
discuss our 2024 outlook, Tim Bruckner will join us as usual for Q&A.
Western Alliance's diversified national commercial business strategy continued to drive strong momentum in the
fourth quarter as we generated earnings per share of $1.33 or $1.91, excluding $0.58 of onetime notable items.
The quarter featured both healthy balance sheet growth and additional balance sheet repositioning actions to
further optimize our funding base. Looking past these notable items, which Dale will explain shortly, highlights for
the quarter included solid loan and deposit growth, ongoing capital and liquidity accumulation, and continued
stable asset quality.
Deposit growth of $1 billion allowed us to continue to selectively reduce debt and borrowings. In Q4, we fully
repaid the $1.3 billion of advances from the Bank Term Funding Program, as well as a $300 million, 6.5%
AmeriHome senior notes, which were not replaced with new borrowings. Regarding the AmeriHome notes, we
seized an opportunity to repay this higher cost debt at a discount. Additionally, our portion of the industrywide
FDIC special assessment to replenish the deposit insurance fund totaled $66.3 million. Loans rose $850 million in
the quarter, bolstered by C&I growth within our regional footprint.
Western Alliance begins 2024 supported by a strong capital base and liquidity position. CET1 expanded
approximately 150 basis points during the year to 10.8%, which equates to 9.8% when including AOCI. 80% of
our deposits are either insured or collateralized, which ranks among the highest levels for the 50 largest US

banks. Despite the industry's challenges, our total deposits increased 3% year-over-year. Asset quality also
remains in very good shape, with limited net charge-offs of only 6 basis points of average loans in 2023. Limited
realized losses amidst a normalized credit backdrop is indicative in our view of the merits of lending with low
advance rates, adhering to conservative underwriting standards and approaching credit mitigation proactively.
Continuing to shift our funding base from borrowings to core deposits better positions us to grow loans in a rate
environment influx likely to decline later this year. We have made investments and leadership additions in order to
drive increased C&I growth in our regional footprint, expands the income opportunities across client relationships
and complement the growth of our national business lines, particularly our leading – a leading deposit focused
verticals.
Overall, in 2024, we look forward to consistent balance sheet and PPNR growth with higher liquidity and
improving capital. This will empower Western Alliance to continue partnering with our clients on their most
important projects. Dale will now take you through the financial performance. Afterwards, I will provide you with
our 2024 outlook.

Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Ken. For the year, Western Alliance produced net revenue of $2.6 billion, net income of $722 million
and EPS of $6.54. Net revenue increased 3% from the prior year, demonstrating the durability and flexibility of our
business model. Net interest income rose $123 million or approximately 6% to over $2.3 billion, notwithstanding
our curtailed loan growth and the completion of a series of asset sales earlier in the year. Noninterest income
declined $44 million from to $281 million, the repositioning actions, the impact of fair value market, as well as the
slower mortgage purchase market. Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion increased $466 million year-over-year,
primarily due to higher earnings credit rates and deposit costs driven by the rising rate environment.
Turning to the fourth quarter trends and business drivers, we generated reported pre-provision net revenue of
$220 million, net income of $148 million, and EPS of $1.33. As part of the balance sheet optimization efforts
conducted earlier to support and improve our earnings trajectory, we repaid $300 million of AmeriHome senior
notes at a discount. We utilized this gain to better position the balance sheet by selling securities as well as MSR
fair value adjustments and sales, which combined produced a pre-tax loss of $4.5 million in addition to the $66
million FDIC special assessment.
When excluding these onetime notable items, we generated adjusted net income of $211 million and EPS of
$1.91. Net interest income increased $4.7 million during the quarter to $592 million from higher average earning
asset balances and reduced higher cost borrowings. GAAP noninterest income was $91 million or excluding
notable items, $126 million, which was down approximately $3 million from Q3. During the quarter, WAL saw
approximately $200 million of mortgage servicing rights, which improved our capital ratios despite incurring a loss
of $11 million on disposition. As prepayment speed began to recover from historically low levels, evaluation of
mortgage servicing rights moved lower at an accelerated pace, which resulted in a $14 million fair value
adjustment net of hedging.
We don't believe this aggregate $25 million charge is indicative of the earnings profile of our mortgage banking
business. Lot volume has rebounded 29% year-over-year and may be indicative of continued momentum into
2024. Since the December rate rally and resulting lower mortgage rates, we have experienced incremental
refinance volume and firming margins. Should mortgage rates trend lower in future quarters, we would expect this
business to benefit, which has not been captured in our go-forward guidance.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
Additionally, income from equity investments was elevated by approximately $8 million due to outsized gains from
solar tax credit investments with higher than-expected performance during the quarter. GAAP noninterest
expense was $462 million, or excluding noted items $435 million, a quarterly increase of $9 million. Deposit cost
growth slowed markedly, increasing $3 million in Q4 as our settlement services and homeowners association
businesses experienced strong growth in new customers that have surpassed seasonal declines in mortgage
warehouse. Provision expense was $9.3 million, reflecting a steady asset quality.
Lastly, our effective tax rate of approximately 30% was temporarily elevated in Q4, primarily because of timing
issues related to low income housing units that were not placed into service in 2023. The 2024 tax rate should
reset from 22% to 23%. Loans held for investment grew $850 million to $50.3 billion, while deposits increased $1
billion to $55.3 billion at quarter-end. Mortgage servicing rights declined to $1.1 billion from MSR sales and
reduced valuations resulting from the lower rate environment.
Overall, we continue to build high quality liquid asset levels and on balance sheet liquidity via strong deposit
growth. Debt repayments previously discussed reduced investments in cash by $351 million from September 30.
Strong deposit growth over the last three quarters has allowed us to cut total borrowings and debt by half from the
end of Q1. Finally, tangible book value per share increased $3.06 or 7% over the prior quarter and 16% year-
over-year to $46.72 from retained earnings and reduced drag from negative all other comprehensive income.
Loans held for investment growth was predominantly from C&I categories, some of which was [indiscernible]
(00:09:28) utilization. Construction and land loans were up $220 million, with a little under half of this contribution
from lot banking. Given the national undersupply of homes and a greater likelihood of near-term rate cuts, we are
still positive about the macroeconomics for this business.
Deposit growth of $1 billion was achieved despite typical seasonal declines in mortgage warehouse deposits
related to tax and insurance payments. We continue to experience broad-based growth from our specialized
value-added deposit channels. HOA had its best Q4 ever, and we believe it will retain and possibly extend its
leading market share in the country it had achieved in Q3 of last year. Settlement services, tech and innovation,
corporate trust, and our digital consumer channel all grew materially and contributed to well-diversified growth.
Noninterest-bearing DDA comprised 26% of total deposits, of which 45% have no cash payment of earnings
credits. The decline in noninterest-bearing balances was primarily driven by the expected $3 billion decrease from
typical mortgage warehouse seasonality of property tax and insurance escrow funds. There has been no client
attrition associated with these outflows, and this decline is recovering as anticipated this quarter.
Turning now to net interest drivers, HFI loan yield decreased 8 basis points due to the full quarter impact of the
$1.3 billion reclassification of loans from held-for-sale to held-for-investment at the end of Q3. This coincidently
resulted in held-for-sale yields climbing 31 basis points. Going forward, we anticipate HFI yields to continue to be
supported by an average of $2.9 billion of loans repricing or maturing per quarter in 2024. The yield on total
investments expanded 8 basis points in Q4 to 4.99%. The securities portfolio grew $1.9 billion to $13 billion from
the ongoing HQLA build, which has increased treasuries from $900 million at the end of Q1 of last year to
approximately $4.9 billion at year-end.
The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 7 basis points, markedly slower than the prior quarter, and the
total cost of funds increased 2 basis points to 2.82% due to an increase in demand deposits and lower short-term
borrowings. Deposit growth enabled the $768 million increased reduction in average short-term borrowings, as
well as 6 basis points of improvement in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. In aggregate, net interest income
5

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
increased approximately $5 million, while the net interest margin of 3.65% came in at the midpoint of our Q4
guidance. Our net interest income growth was exceeded by the growth rate of average earning assets.
Noninterest expenses were impacted by $27 million in net notable items this quarter. Adjusting for these onetime
items as well as deposit costs, our adjusted efficiency ratio rose 100 basis points to 51%. We expect deposit
costs will experience relief from a cessation of rate hikes and should fall as rates decline. For historical context,
average ECR balances were $19.9 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $17 billion in Q3 and $15.4 billion in
Q4 of 2022. We expect ECR-related deposits to remain a consistent relative proportion of our deposit base as
total deposits grow. Based upon our rate forecast and generally high beta repricing for ECR-related deposits, we
expect cessed pricing to largely decline in lockstep with rate cuts, offsetting any potential net interest margin
declines.
Asset quality metrics continue to remain stable and in line with what we reported last quarter. The aggregate net
increase in special mention loans and classified assets was only $7 million from the Q3 level. Nonperforming
assets increased to $281 million, equating to 40 basis points of total assets, which is 5 basis points above the
third quarter. Quarterly net loan charge-offs were $8.5 million or 7 basis points of average loans, which was
aligned with Q3 net charge-offs. Provision expense of $9.3 million was a function of loan growth and a slightly
improved Moody's consensus forecast, though our consensus and severely adverse weightings for our ACL still
incorporate an 80% recessionary outlook.
Our allowance increased $10 million from the prior quarter to $337 million, and the ACL ratio was 73 basis points,
covering 135% of nonperforming loans. Looking at the reserve block, you'll see an updated look on the context
behind our allowance, which when considering insured loans or in those in low loss categories, the allowance
shifts up to 1.31% of loans.
Our CET 1 ratio rose 20 basis points to 10.8% or 9.8% when adjusting for the AOCI debit. Our tangible common
equity to total assets grew approximately 50 basis points from Q3 to 7.3% from earnings and the improved AOCI
position. Tangible book value per share increased $3.06 from Q3 to $46.72 from earnings and recapture of AOCI
marks. The $220 million improvement in AOCI resulted from substantial decreases in intermediate term treasury
rates during the quarter. Our consistent upward trajectory in tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by
almost 5x since 2013, including strong growth in 2023. Over most of the time periods, Western Alliance continues
to generate a top quartile total shareholder return relative to both asset size peers and the Regional Banking
Index.
Turning the call back to Ken.

Thanks, Dale.
Our guidance for 2024 is to build on the second half momentum of 2023 and progress towards returning to above-
industry returns. In the first half of 2024, the company will emphasize liquidity growth over loan growth, drive
capital above 11% and further build our HQLA portfolio, which will temper earnings growth for the first half of the
year. As these goals are achieved, earnings momentum will accelerate in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.
So for the full year of 2024, we expect a continued thoughtful balance sheet growth, driven by our diversified
business model with an origination mix designed to drive net interest income above 2023 levels. Loan and core
6

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
deposits are expected to grow $2 billion and $8 billion, respectively, for the year. Core deposits-driven growth
should continue to push our loan-to-deposit ratio towards the mid-80% level by the middle of this year.
Regarding capital, we are targeting a CET 1 ratio above 11%, reflecting steady organic capital accumulation in
concert with balance sheet growth. Net interest income should grow 5% to 10% from a Q4 2023 annualized
jumping off point. This forecast assumes four 25-basis point cuts back-loaded in the year. We expect any future
NIM compression resulting from the rate cuts to be matched by comparable deposit cost declines in noninterest
expense, which will be accretive to earnings.
Noninterest income should increase 10% to 20% from an adjusted 2023 baseline level of $397 million, which
excludes 2023's mark-to-market adjustments and the impact of asset sales as we prioritize growing commercial
banking-related fee income from holistic customer relationships. Mortgage banking-related income will be
somewhat dependent on the rate environment and mortgage buying, I should say and mortgage buying. But we're
encouraged that with the recent low rate environment, application volume is picking up with firmer margins thus
far in early 2024.
Noninterest expense, inclusive of the ECR-related deposit cost, should rise only 0% to 2% from an annualized
adjusted Q4 baseline of $1.740 billion and allow for continued operating leverage. In aggregate, these factors will
enable WAL to consistently grow PPNR throughout the year. Asset quality remains manageable and we project
continue support from our sponsors. Based on our conservative underwriting and low advance rates, net charge-
offs are expected to be 10 to 15 basis points for the year as the economic cycle normalizes. Lastly, we expect the
effective tax rate to revert between 22% and 23% starting in Q1.
At this time, Tim, Dale and I are happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies.
The line is now open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, wanted to start on the four cuts and how that impacts the PPNR
guide. Obviously, it hits you guys a number of ways. Dale, I think you said that it does not – your fees does not
account for any upside in mortgage banking. It sounds like the deposit costs within expenses are 100% beta. Can
you just confirm that? And then the four cuts, how would that – what kind of deposit beta are you expecting for the
non-ECR component and how that would impact NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. In aggregate, I mean, to get into PPNR, the net impact is fairly nominal. I mean, as we've indicated in the
past, if you just look at net interest income, we're modestly asset sensitive. So that would be a little bit of a
decrement. But, of course, you alluded to the ECR repriced deposits, which we expect to fall and fall in line. Yeah,
so put those together, we think we're, again, now modestly – we're modestly liability sensitive, and we have a net
benefit there in PPNR excluding the AmeriHome piece, which is the option on – it's the call option if things get that
much better in that space.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So AmeriHome would be gravy, if it did. But obviously, if it's back-half-loaded, it might be modest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So the mix might look a little different. I mean, if you had a more accelerated rate decline, maybe you're
going to see a faster decline, perhaps, in net interest income, reflecting the net interest income profile that we
have. But again, when you layer in the deposit cost, I think it's going to eliminate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then so the loan-to-deposit growth guide for 2024, you got $6 billion of liquidity to play with. What is the
plan for that, build the bond book, build cash, pay down borrowings? Just wondering what your plans are there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So when I think about the year, I think about it the first half of the year, we're building the liquidity profile, as
you mentioned. With that, we're really going to build our HQLA portfolio, and we're looking to drive our loan-to-
deposit ratios, as I said, in the mid-80s. From there, it's growth towards a much bigger and better 2025. So we
need to continue to reposition ourselves. We think we'll have that done by the end of the second quarter, and then
it'll be a little bit more traditional earnings as you have seen them historically from us. But I would say, and when
you think about it, the deposit and loans are more coming in across the year in a ratable fashion with about $500
million per quarter for loans and approximately $2 billion per quarter for deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Thank you. And then just last one, Dale, you mentioned the [ph] DEA (00:22:27) sounds like it's
recovering seasonally within mortgage warehouse. Just any update you can share on how much of that $3 billion
has come back in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so it's really based upon semi-annual property tax payments largely in California. And so we would expect
that we're going to get half of that or two-thirds of that this quarter, and then the rest of it would start coming in as
the payments due in May are less dramatic in terms of kind of the dip that we see. Meanwhile, other warehouse
bonds look to be growing consistently, and we're also off to a good start in our HOA biz for Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Casey, let me just add, right now, we're on track to beat the $2 billion for our Q1 and that's inclusive of the HOA
deposits coming back in.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody. I wanted to start on the margin. So you were at 3.65% in the quarter, right in the middle of what
you had guided to. Dale, for you, how should we think about the NIM trending, the backdrop of four cuts? And
then, it's funny, when I look at where the NIM was, we had a more normal curve. I mean, you guys were like
4.50%, but it's a completely different balance sheet today. So assuming we eventually get a normal curve, normal
level of rates, like what's a reasonable NIM for this balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, hello, Steve. It's Ken. What I would say is, again, thinking about the year, the first two quarters of the year, the
NIM should track consistent with our Q4 NIM of 3.65%. And then Q3 and Q4, the NIM will gently roll down as the
rate cuts come into play, but offsetting that NIM decline will be the reduction in ECR expenses.
So what's transpired is we have and we expect to continue to have considerably more liquidity on the balance
sheet and that is going to kind of depress NIM in a basically a permanent basis. Where can we be kind of going
forward? I think we could be close to kind of where we are. Maybe the 3.5% range is kind of sustainable kind of
over kind of a broader economic cycle than what we see. We'll probably have a little bit better return on the
residential portfolio than we presently have. But for the most part, I think our number is rather than being in the 4s,
I think we're destined for the 3% level here going forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then on the expense guide, so you guys were $437 million on the ECR deposit costs in 2023. What's
assumed within this expense guidance for 2024 for the cost of ECR deposits? Like, where is that roughly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So that's fairly stable until we get to – as we indicated earlier, we have a back-end loaded four cuts starting
in June in the rate. And so that would kind of curtail based upon kind of how that plays out.

Steve? Got you then. I would say just keep in mind, you're thinking about – your question is based on total dollars.
And so the rate will be coming down. Total dollars may still rise as we continue to push on deposit growth. So just
keep in mind the rate volume impact there, okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. Okay. Ken, could I just finally ask you a big picture question? So when look at the company, right,
years back, we had the financial crisis and you guys made quite a few changes after that, right, built out national
businesses, you had top decile growth for a long time. Then we had March Madness. You again pivoted, right?
You made adjustments, pushing up insured deposits, change in liquidity, et cetera. When I look at the 2024 guide,
it looks like more of the same in the first half. But then we get to the second half of the year and then 2025, what
does this company then look like? Do you throttle up loan growth from where we are? Do you throttle that deposit
growth? Are you back to a growth bank? Like how do you see the world right now in the longer term for the
company? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, good question. We started to pivot, by the way, in the third quarter of 2022 with higher liquidity and higher
capital. And we certainly were very happy that we did as we entered March Madness. It really served us well. And
that's informed our decision-making as to why we want to keep that moving forward. And as you said, we'll have
that basically completed by the first half of 2024.
Then I think what you're going to see is a little bit of the same bank, but I don't think we're going to put foot on the
accelerator as hard as we used to push down on the throttle there. And one reason is we never got really paid for
that. So, up until the end of 2022, we were probably growing deposits and loans about 24%, 25% per year. And
we didn't see that in our valuation. And in fact, people always got nervous with that and said, gee, there must be a
credit problem that was lurking behind. But really, over that period of time, we only had $29 million of net losses.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
So what we're going to do is we're going to be targeting for above-industry trend growth going forward in the back
half of 2024 and into 2025. And we think we'll get rewarded for that and take away any concerns that always
linger about going way back even to 2006 and 2007 and 2008 that people bring up. And I think we'll run from
there. But we should be higher in return on equity, higher on return on assets, but not to the old levels of coming
back to 2010 to 2013, 2014, 2015, okay?

Good morning.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
I guess maybe just one bigger picture question around earnings, if I have the math right in terms of your earnings
outlook, you probably shake out around $8 in EPS for 2024. Should we expect EPS to dip in the first half before
reaccelerating in the back half of the year? How do you think about earnings growth relative to the $1.91 you
printed in the fourth quarter? Just given the moving pieces around what you're doing with HQLA, the benefit of
rate cuts in the back half. I would love to hear just the earnings trajectory that you're looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So that's a really good question, Ebrahim. So – and maybe implicitly in your comments. So the first quarter
generally does have a dip and you can see this in prior years relative to 4Q. And some of this is seasonal or
based on higher prices, costs, of course, there's a fewer number of days in Q1. So and we get into that, that
should have a bit of a softer point in at the beginning of the year. Moving into Q2, H1, it's going to be impacted by
what Ken is talking about in terms of continuing to build out and finish by the end of the second quarter, early in
the third, our HQLA positioning. So that would result in a little lower earnings growth during those first two periods
as basically the deposit growth, which we think is going to be fairly strong, is diverted into an asset class that
doesn't yield as much. As that changes and as our loan-to-deposit ratio is in the 80s, so by summer, that's going
to be a more proportionate growth rate in loans as well as deposits. And hence, you do get a growth rate picking
up through the end of 2024 and carrying into 2025.

That's helpful. And I guess the other question, you mentioned about never getting paid on the – for loan growth
back in the day. When we think about how you're acquiring and what type of deposits you are acquiring today,
maybe, Ken, is it different? I mean, you've obviously emphasized the regions and the deposit growth from the
regions, but I'm just wondering if your view around large chunky deposits has changed given sort of the emphasis
on liquidity. And as a result of that, should we expect you to kind of go about differently when it comes to deposit
growth and client acquisition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, so thanks for the question. And I think your question is insightful because that's how we're changing around
the business. So, we've been working on a number of new deposit verticals that are really getting legs behind
them. And the first is settlement services. And just this quarter alone, we grew settlement services $2.1 billion.
And so there, the deposits are a little larger, but the growth rate is steady and consistent. So, as you get to a
certain level, large deposits will flow off and then you got to bring other large deposits in.
Additionally, we have our business that's growing, corporate trust business, and that, too, is beginning to get
some legs. And in this quarter, that grew by $350 million. Now, that business will continue to grow, but it really will
be helped once we get our investment grade ratings back. And go back to the pivot, the pivot is to get to our
investment grade ratings, so that corporate trust can be a bigger contributor to our deposits. And we think with an
over 11% CET 1 ratio, mid-80s loan-to-deposit ratio, steady asset quality, we will position ourselves to get
upgraded there.
Now, HOA has been a long – actually what was probably our first national business line and that continues to
knock the ball out of the park. In usually what is a slow quarter, the fourth that is, they grew $300 million. For the
year, they grew about $1.2 billion. And those are steady, smaller deposits. They come in from either new
business that we win and the existing clients growing their book of business. So we get that two ways.
Then another business that we're very pleased with was the one we started in early January, January 4, 2023,
which is our consumer digital platform. This quarter alone, that brought in nearly $800 million. And that's been a
real homerun for us. And that's where we see deposits more in the $53,000 to $57,000 range for each client.
Now, going forward in 2024 into 2025, we're going to try to shift the platform from an outside vendor to an internal
platform. And so we're going to probably run two platforms for a while as we come up to speed with our own
platform. But that will help us also longer term, and it will reduce, not in 2024, but going forward in 2025 and 2026,
it will reduce some of our maintenance expenses.
And then last but not least, let's not forget what we are and our traditional ball game here and that is the regions.
And we've been rethinking, redesigning the regions. That was the reason why we moved Tim out of his Chief
Credit Officer role into the Chief Banking Officer for the regions. That's why we brought in Lynne Herndon to take
over the Chief Credit Officer role. And Tim's charge is to rethink and reimagine the regions and have them be
more C&I-focused. And with that focus in C&I, of course, there'll be more deposits. And I should mention that
$600 million came in this quarter from the regions as well in deposits, but it will also help us grow our fee income.
And so we're going to get a twofer there over the long term. It'll be easier to bring in the deposits first and then
that fee income as we continue to sell or cross-sell our treasury management services will help us towards the

back end of 2024. But again, pick up some steam into the new year of 2025. So I hope that kind of gives you a
sense of what we've been doing. And we're looking at some other deposit verticals that are just early, early
stages, and we'll probably work on them this year and hope to have them ready to go either in the back end of
2024 or early 2025.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Well, that is helpful. Thanks for the rundown, Ken. And what I didn't hear was, does this change at all your view
around doing any bank M&A that you pick up a retail franchise, bring in another deposit sort of generating
engine? Or is that not kind of part of the equation today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So today, it's not part of the equation. We're not talking about M&A at all. Again, we're talking about the 11% CET
1 kind of move that upward, but it will at some point. The M&A question will – or conversation will come into play
as we continue to get bigger and bigger. We kind of do what we think we're going to do with deposits. Then, we
now will be brought into play as we approach $100 billion. But frankly, that's a premature conversation at this
point. I think we still have a couple of years before we get to $100 billion.

Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just the first one on the loan growth guide of $2 billion or $500 million a quarter. I
thought we had previously talked about maybe some acceleration in loan growth in the second half. Is that just
you all being a little conservative in the guide to start the year or should we not necessarily expect a step-up in
loan growth in the second half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, first, let me say, Q4, we thought loan growth was going to be between zero and $300 million. And so we were
a little surprised that it came in at $850 million. I'd rather be surprised on the upside as a general trend. But we're
still going to be a little cautious about economic activity going forward. And so, we're going to be mindful of this
recession or slowdown that always was advertised to come but has not showed up yet. And then, we have sort of
de-emphasized certain asset classes for now, those seeing obviously CRE office and residential just to name the
two, some construction areas as well.
And so, we're just going to stay with the guide of $500 million a quarter. We think that's reasonable. And if the
liquidity comes in faster than we think, then we'll look to deploy it in loan growth. As a general rule, we've never
had problem deploying our liquidity and getting good, safe, sound, and thoughtful loan growth.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then on the fee income guide, if you look at the fourth quarter run rate, I think when you make the fair
value adjustments, that exclude the securities losses and coming up with a run rate closer to $124 million, correct
me if I'm wrong. And you annualize that, you're talking about, call it, $492 million, and your guide at the midpoint
is roughly $457 million off the last year's base. So maybe correct me if I'm wrong on that $124 million. But if that is
correct, it only implies – it implies, you're down 7% this year. And obviously, you talked about not assuming any
uptick in mortgage, but just want to get the puts and takes there of what we might not be thinking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Look, so we have a few things going on on the noninterest income side, some of which we're kind of
implementing now. We've got a kind of a service charge revision that we're going to be undertaking. We think as
rates decline and ECRs come down, then that puts more clients into a position where the earnings credit rate
does not necessarily cover all of their consumption of internal services. And that could also kind of push that up.
So we think that, again, we're looking for growth in that category certainly kind of going forward and kind of expect
to see that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just last one for me on the interest-bearing deposits. Can you update us on the spot rate at the
end of the year? And it seems like the pressure there is subsiding and kind of how you think about the beta on the
way down on interest-bearing specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Interest-bearing deposits spot rate was [ph] 3.63% (00:41:28) at year-end. In terms of the beta coming
down, we think it's going to be very strong. We expect betas to be certainly no slower on the way down than they
were on the way up. You may recall that our betas have been faster than industry norms kind of this entire time.
And our clients are expecting that that is that – we're watching that closely and so are they. So I expect that we're
going to be able to pull down the interest bearing cost for those that are ECR-related, pull those down as well on
the imputed yields that some of them have, which might be tied to the effective Fed funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Good afternoon. Ken, maybe a question on the balance sheet and capital. You talked about not wanted to
be in the 98-percentile or so in terms of growth perspective that you won't get paid for it. But you're at – you're
going to be at 11% pretty soon like – can you open the door a little bit on comments about appetite for buyback
maybe in the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Right now, we have no plans to do a buyback and 11% is a little more of a floor for us. I know we call it a
target, but it's more of a floor. So we want to build above that. And then we'll have a growth capital. And as we
enter 2025, well, we're going to have a lot of decisions to make, yeah. If we see a lot of internal growth in front of
us, that's where I like to deploy the money. First, you got to tell me what the economic environment is, and I'll tell
you if we're going to do a buyback. But really, the buyback conversation has not been on the table in this
company. And again, the 11% is a floor for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So nothing for 2024. But perhaps, where the alternatives between accelerating the growth and using the
capital. Is that a fair for 2025 conversation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We've spent a lot of time talking about 2025, yeah, we want to get through 2024 and make everything we just told
you. But for 2024 I can definitely tell you there's no buyback on the table.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. In terms of – Dale, in terms of the balance sheet, you mentioned the HQLA bill. How – are you
targeting a percent of your balance sheet in securities? How do we think of the outcome this quarter? How do we
think about just the absolute kind of bridging the $8 billion and the $2 billion, how much will go to buying
incremental bonds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, I mean, you can impute this from kind of our guidance whereby we're showing $1.5 billion if you just did
it ratably of growth in deposits in excess of loans. And the preponderance of that is certainly going to go to HQLA.
As we talked about earlier, the first half of the year kind of getting over that hurdle that we think will be added by
end of summer and was going to do that. So if you just did, that will be $3 billion more in terms of HQLA that
would take us to there. And then at that point in time, maybe there is a more proportional growth rate between
loans and deposits. But that's kind of the range, the numbers we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bernard Von Gizycki of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now
open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Just a question on ECR pricing dynamics. I know you noted the ECR-related deposit costs are expected
to decline with rates and volume. Just on rates, I believe you have some deposits that pay the Fed funds and
others that are in the lower 2% range. So if you get a 25 basis point cut with 100% beta does that flow through all
customers or just the higher cost ECR deposits? And then you need additional rate cuts to get to the lower 3s
before cutting them? Or will ECR rates decline for all ECR deposits regardless of relationship?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yes. The preponderance of our ECR price deposits are of the type that you initially talk about, i.e., those that are
really tied to effective Fed funds. And we think the beta with those is going to be very near 100%. The second
piece where rates are significantly lower, we probably have maybe a stutter step with the first rate increase. We're
not necessarily going to be able to kind of fully kind of pass through. But after that, I think we can put them on a
trajectory as well, but that those betas will be significantly lower. Maybe we can get to 50% on that piece of it. But
the larger piece, I think is going to be at or near 100%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And if we think about the volumes between those two or the balances, are they much higher for the 3%, like the
lower one? So once you start getting the cuts, even though you have the 100% beta for the [indiscernible]
(00:46:57) Fed funds, is it just a smaller balance? I'm not sure we could size that or give a magnitude between the
two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, between what you're going to see in terms of warehouse lending, some of the things that are
settlement services, some of our HOA deposits, you're probably approximately two-thirds of the number is going
to have an elevated beta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then if I could just ask one more. Just on your outlook guidance, just so we think about net interest
income, you have the up 5% and up 10%. Could you just give us the underlying assumptions, just the difference
between the two, like what gets you to the 10%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The 10% on net interest income is a combination of really the loan growth as we move forward. That's what's
going to move us in that direction. And the additional liquidity we're bringing in and placing that into investments.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, what does the yield curve look like? I mean, if the yield curve tends to be flat or it remains inverted, that's
going to probably look a little bit better on some of these commercial loans. What does that mix look like and how
is competitive pricing changing for all those items? I don't – we don't have a lot of insight into what that might be
as the parameters around a number that might be more median.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Just had a question, it seems – obviously a bit more technical in nature, but it seems like loan yields are down
linked quarter in almost every lending category. I was curious, if you just kind of touch based on maybe the
nuance of why – might be just a technicality like I said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I did talk about a little bit on the – on what happened on the loans held for sale versus investment
whereby we did a transfer from held for sale to investment, and it really has gone down to the last day or they just
before that of the third quarter. So that will affect their dropped loan yields back to some degree. There's also kind
of been some mixed revisions in there going forward. We're still seeing pricing opportunity on the repricing
elements. We talked about the $2.9 billion that on average we have a rolling or this year and while the piece of
that it is fixed rate, that's probably in about 20% of that number. Those have a more ratable increase little bit on
the variable side, we're still looking at elevated spreads relative to when those loans were originated two to three
years ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's good. So the next question I had was the spreads you're seeing in the market today like it seems
like a lot of the $100-plus-billion banks are stepping back in certain categories. Are you seeing better spreads
because there's less lenders available or less lending being done from the bigger banks, or is it kind of more just
calling your shots and you're not seeing too many differ? Because, I mean, you do bank solid clients. So they
17

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
typically would have the best rate available because it's a competitive market. I'm just trying to think about the
yields going forward and especially pricing in a couple of cuts in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. It's almost market-by-market dependent. There are just things going on in different markets for us. If you're
talking tech and innovation spreads, they really haven't moved, but a little more competitive because there's less
deal flow because they're raising a less cash there. If you're talking some very specific like banking deals,
spreads are strong and we were getting our pricing. And some of these banks are moving in and moving out. It's
really hard to give one generic answer as to why they are all pulling back or not.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Okay. If I could just sneak in one more in. You said 11% is a bit of a floor going forward in capital. But
you also referenced the credit rating. The moment we get a public announcement from a credit rating agency, is
that a catalyst events for you guys or is it more or less you get to the 11% is kind of what you guys agreed upon?
And once you hit at 11%, you kind of operate a bit more autonomously?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, the 11% is, as I said a floor for us. We have to engage or continue to engage with the rating agencies.
That's usually a two-step process. They usually put you on outlook positive and then come back and make a
change. As far as I know so far, we got a change in our outlook from Fitch. But I don't know there's any other
bank that had a change in their outlook. So my sense is the rating agencies may be a little slow to pull the trigger.
But when we go in there, we want to go in there with great capital levels of firm, steady, stable asset quality and a
very strong liquidity. And that's how we're positioning the company. And in the meantime, our Corporate Trust
Group is still operating and bringing in good business they could just bring in more business with the upgrade to
an investment rating. So they're doing just fine and it would just – this would just accelerate their opportunities to
bring in more business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Okay. I appreciate it. You're probably at 12% by the time you get that announcement. But I appreciate

Yeah. 7.03%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you very much. I also wanted to get a better sense for the BTFP. What was the rationale behind
paying off the BTFP but not more expensive borrowings? I think the last time in your 3Q 10-Q, I think the rate on
the BTFP was 4.76% versus the average short-term borrowing rate of 5.74% this quarter. I just wanted to better
understand the thought process there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Frankly, we just thought, we didn't need to be [indiscernible] (00:54:25) for the reserve. And so we did that. I
agree with you it's at a modest cost. It was going to mature anyway. This is something that we had acquired in
March of last year, and it was a 12-month deal. So it was a couple of months early relative to what it would have
been. But we thought we just – it was part of the 2023 situation, and we'll leave it behind in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. I wanted to clarify just on the ECR-related deposits. I think the slide says you have $17.8 billion
of ECR deposits at quarter-end, but you've got about $14.5 billion of NIB. So is there another component of the
ECR-related deposits that's technically still interest-bearing but also gets compensated through ECR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Correct. So what will happen is we – depending on what type of client it is. We could have a situation
whereby the manager gets the ECR, and the owner gets the interest income. So you don't really see that in
mortgage warehouse because those are really not interest-bearing deposits. But on an HOA, for example, it's a
dual situation most commonly whereby the aggregator gets earnings credit rate on the dollars that are owned by
the HOA itself. That is not interest expense because they simply have no claim on that liability to us and the
deposits of that enterprise. So that's why it's a doubled up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then the last question I had was just on the MSR loss. I just wanted to maybe understand the
mechanics a little bit. Dale, did you – throughout the course of this past year, did you maybe put a higher mark on
the MSR and the corresponding production, capitalize it at a higher rate and did that impact the gain on sale
margin at all? And then you'd have to take a loss on it when rates moved against you and you sold the MSR this
quarter? I just want to understand the moving parts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, no. No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, it was kind of the volatility around what happened. So we saw CPRs
declined to the slowest than I think I'd ever seen and maybe some recent business had been around, but they
were like 3% to 4% on the constant prepayment risk. And that is exceptionally low – and then when rates picked
19


Western Alliance Bancorp.
(WAL) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
up again, I mean, rate fell, CPR has jumped, and maybe it was a little bit of a catch-up from refis or whatever that
have been delayed. And so, as a result of that, we had a gain in our hedge that fell short of the loss in terms of
the valuation. So the result was – the value of those servicing rights fell by $100 million in the fourth quarter. And
we were $14 million shy of what we picked up in terms of gain on the hedge. And that was because we had such
a rapid velocity change between a very low CPR and maybe the lowest ever to which is something that was more
normalized. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, Brody, I just – to remind you that, by the end of Q4, the 10-year treasury dropped 69 basis points from
4.57% to 3.88% just punctuate sales point. And this is – the MSR balance, we have several outside valuation
firms that come in and look at that MSR and evaluate for us to make sure that we're within the appropriate range.

Andrew Terrell Q

Hey. Good morning. Dale, if I could start just I heard comments around the mortgage banking and kind of the
potential upside there not being captured on the go-forward guide. Just to the extent the mortgage market does
turn, and we do end up seeing kind of upside on the fee income front over time, can you just remind us the
incremental efficiency in that business and maybe just to give us a better sense of how the expenses would
fluctuate with the [indiscernible] (00:58:56) fees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, so where they were on standalone enterprise, they were running about 50%. And when we
acquired them, we were in kind of low 40s, and they came in and that took us to kind of the mid-40s. I think that's
basically intact today. So, yeah, so it's frankly their marginal rate of efficiency is pretty close to the bank's overall
now as the bank has invested in elements of the higher cost with technology and some of this risk management
infrastructure and lower investment yields related to the building of the HQLA. So, right now, our efficiency ratios
are comparable at about 50%.

Okay. I appreciate it. And then just looking at the deposit cost expense line this quarter, if I compare the disclosed
expense on deposit calls versus the average balance of ECR deposits, it looks like on a percentage basis that the

cost ticked down a few basis points this quarter. Have you lowered rates anywhere on the product already or is
that more of a function of mix this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We haven't lowered rates, but what we have done is we have one-off of clients and said look your spread relative
to, say, effective Fed funds has been X and we're going to make it X minus. And some of this is going to happen a
little – maybe perhaps a little bit later. We're going to do something today. But we've given them options. If you
want to take a rate cut now, we'll skip maybe the first one you get. So we're pushing those down on a basically
individually as we kind of go through this. So we are picking that up now. I think that's going to continue into
January, February.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q

And did you see any attrition as a result of those conversations or is there any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. So there hasn't been any attrition. And I think that is an input point for us in terms of what is our pricing like
relative to alternatives elsewhere. I think what it means is that, the fever has broken on the rate cycle certainly
and the opportunity to move into either other financial institutions or to move it to some kind of off balance sheet
thing that maybe is invested in treasuries. All of those have fallen in terms of what the opportunity is or what they
might be able to migrate to. And I think that has helped us in this negotiation. We do these one-off and to some
degree sequentially, in case we run into a situation like that where we're starting to see some attrition and like,
okay, well, that's an important point. And then we'll ease off in terms of how many we're doing or what we're
asking for them to give up.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Smith of Autonomous. David, your line is now open.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Thank you. I want to circle back to those normalized NIM comments earlier in the call. Are you saying that 3.5%
should be a floor or more the middle range for NIM in a typical rate cycle?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jan-2024
Well, that was kind of – that was in a kind of an extended conversation of where might we head over time and
getting back to a number of a four-handle. I don't see that. So, I mean, that's an extended expectation of maybe
kind of where we might be. I do feel like that we're approaching kind of an equilibrium level now. And so the 3.5%
number is not that far from that. But, I'm not – that isn't our guidance in terms of kind of where we're headed in
2024. We do think that as I indicated...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And on capital...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sorry, go on. Yeah, David, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Yeah. So if there's nothing else on the NIM, talking about capital, if you're going to keep doing a high-teens
ROTCE and with your loan growth guide, I think that only implies something like 4% or 5% RWA growth this year.
So that just seems to imply a ton of excess capital being generated. And you should reach 11% CET1 pretty soon
and 11% is the floor. But is there a level where you think that just starts to get excess of and even regardless of
the change in ratings, just it starts to make sense to turn on the buyback if you're still being measured with a little
bit longer...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Look, as we're – as we climb above 11%, I think it introduces optionality. You can build capital and then that could
be part of an M&A transaction. There could be multiple things that going to done with it. But again, it's just – we're
not there right now. And we're, again, cleaning up kind of the last few things that we want to change on our
balance sheet. And by this summertime, I think we'll be there in terms of the profile we're looking for liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. And lastly on deposits, can you share how much of the interest-bearing deposits are indexed to a rate as
opposed to having some level of discretion at the bank in terms of pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I mean, so – I mean, if you look at our interest-bearing deposit cost, you can see that that is not as large of a
component relative to kind of some of these ECR outlooks we've been talking about. So, there is some that is a
little bit higher beta. But it is less significant than on the ECR piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timur Brazilerof Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Please go ahead. Sorry, Timur, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Timur has disconnected. At this time, we
currently have no further questions, so I'll hand back to Ken Vecchione for any further remarks.
