MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and
CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are: Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Clark Khayat, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our
Chief Risk Officer.
On slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers
our presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I am now moving to slide 3. This morning, we reported earnings of $504 million or $0.54 per share. We delivered
positive operating leverage compared to the prior quarter and the year ago period. Our results reflect the
resiliency of both our business model and our teammates as we continue to successfully navigate a rapidly
changing environment. Pre-provision net revenue was up 14% from the first quarter with a 6% increase in
revenue and relatively stable expenses.
Revenue was driven by growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher interest rates and strong loan
growth. Importantly, we will continue to benefit from higher interest rates over the next several years as our
hedges and short-term investments continue to reprice.

Our balance sheet also benefits from our strong stable deposit base. Approximately 60% of our deposits are in
stable retail and escrow balances. In our commercial business, approximately 85% of our deposits are from core
operating accounts.
As I mentioned, loan growth continues to be strong. Average loans were up 5% from the last quarter and 8% from
the year ago period. Adjusting for the planned runoff of PPP and the sale of our indirect auto business, average
loans grew by 21% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by both our consumer and our commercial businesses.
We continue to add clients and support our existing relationships. In our consumer business, we generated over
$3.6 billion in loan originations in the quarter from consumer mortgages and Laurel Road.
Let me spend just a moment on Laurel Road. We continue to see good momentum in this business, then that is
despite the continuation of the federal student loan payment holiday. In May, we launched a new offering for
nurses, the largest segment of the healthcare industry.
While early, we are very encouraged with the response to our expanded offering. Nurses represent a sizable
demographic looking for differentiated, personalized financial products and services, and Laurel Road has the
unique opportunity to meet these needs.
In the second quarter, we also announced the acquisition of GradFin, a leading loan counselor for healthcare
professionals with a digital platform that provides fast and effective solutions for debt relief and government
forgiveness programs.
In June, our first month with GradFin, we held over 3,200 individual consultations for refinance and public student
loan forgiveness. This acquisition aligns well with Laurel Road and our recent expansion to include nurses. These
actions enhance our commitment to accelerate growth through targeted investments in niche digital businesses.
In our commercial businesses, we continue to see strong loan growth in our targeted industry verticals.
Additionally, we benefited from a 100 basis point increase in C&I line utilization. Our outlook for loan growth
across our franchise remains strong.
Fee income this quarter reflects a slowdown in capital markets activity. Importantly, we continue to offer our
clients the best solutions and execution, both on and off balance sheet. This is exactly the way our business
model is designed to work.
In the second quarter, we raised over $36 billion in capital for our clients, retaining 22% on our balance sheet.
Historically, we've retained approximately 18% on our balance sheet. Despite the slowdown in the capital
markets, our pipelines remain strong, and our long-term outlook for this business is positive. We have and we will
continue to invest in this business, including adding high performing senior bankers.
Now let me shift to expenses. Our expense trends this quarter reflect our strong focus on managing costs, while
concurrently making investments, investments in places like additional teammates, investments in digital and of
course, analytics to drive future growth.
In addition to investments in Laurel Road and GradFin that I mentioned earlier, we have also continued to invest
in digital innovations throughout our business, including our recent expansion of our embedded banking platform
with new end-to-end capabilities. We remain committed to delivering sound, profitable growth by maintaining our
risk discipline. Credit quality remained strong this quarter, with net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans
of 16 basis points.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Nonperforming loans and criticized loans both declined this quarter. We will continue to support our clients while
maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through
the entire business cycle.
Our capital levels remain strong, providing us with sufficient capacity to support our clients and return capital to
our shareholders. Our board of directors recently announced our third quarter dividend of $0.195 per share. This
equates to $182 million and a dividend yield of approximately 4.5%. As is our normal practice, the board will
evaluate a dividend increase in the fourth quarter.
I will close this morning by reaffirming our expectation that we will deliver another year of positive operating
leverage in 2022. We recognize there is a great deal of economic uncertainty. Areas like inflation, higher interest
rates, quantitative tightening and of course, the potential for a recession.
Given the economic backdrop, we remain steadfast in our focus on serving our clients, maintaining our strong
balance sheet, managing our capital and remaining disciplined in our credit underwriting. Don will cover the
specifics of our full year guidance in his comments. Overall, Key delivered another solid quarter, and I remain
confident in our future and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don to provide details on the results for the quarter and our outlook for the
balance of 2022. Don?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. For the second quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.54 per
common share, down $0.18 from last year and up $0.09 from the prior quarter. Our results in the current quarter
reflect strong core operating performance and the resiliency of our business model, as we continue to navigate
through the current market conditions.
Importantly, we generated positive operating leverage compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year, and
remain confident in our ability to do so for the full year. As Chris mentioned, pre-provision net revenues was up
14% from the first quarter, with a 6% increase in revenue and relatively stable expenses. Higher net interest
income was driven by strong loan growth and the way we have positioned our balance sheet to benefit from
higher interest rates. Our results also reflect our focus on strong expense management and our strong risk profile.
Turning to slide 6. Average loans for the quarter were $109 billion, up 8% from the year ago period and up 5%
from the prior quarter. We continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise, which drove
strong loan growth in both our commercial and consumer businesses. Commercial loans increased 4% from last
quarter, reflecting broad-based growth across our industry verticals.
Line utilization rates improved this quarter, increasing 100 basis points from last quarter. Our consumer
businesses continued its strong performance as we saw residential real estate originations of $3.2 billion,
resulting in an increase in balances of 13% from last quarter. Consistent with our focus on the healthcare
segment, approximately one-third of our consumer mortgage originations were to healthcare professionals.
Laurel Road originated $445 million of loans this quarter despite the ongoing federal student loan payment
holiday. PPP loan balances were $658 million on average this quarter compared to $7.5 billion last year and $1.2

billion last quarter. If we adjust for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio last year as well as the impact of PPP, our
core loans were up year-over-year by approximately $19 billion on average or 21%.
Continuing on to slide 7. Average deposits totaled $147 billion for the second quarter of 2022, up $3 billion or 2%
compared to the year ago period and down $3 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter. Year-over-year, we
saw a broad-based growth in consumer and commercial relationships, including higher commercial escrow and
retail deposits, partially offset by the expected continued decline in time deposits.
The decline from the prior quarter reflects seasonal commercial outflows, including annual tax payments, as well
as lower public sector deposits related to stimulus funds. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits only increased 2
basis points from the prior quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base, with consumer
deposits accounting for approximately 60% of our total deposit mix. In addition, 85% of our commercial deposits
were from core operating accounts.
Turning to slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.1 billion for the second quarter compared to
$1.02 billion in both the year ago period and the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.61% for the second
quarter compared to 2.52% for the same period last year and 2.46% for the prior quarter.
Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, both net interest income and net interest margin benefited from higher
earning asset balances and a favorable balance sheet mix as well as the benefit from higher interest rates.
Quarter-over-quarter net interest income also benefited from one additional day in the quarter.
Both net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the lower loan fees related to PPP loan forgiveness.
The current quarter reflected $14 million of net interest income from PPP, down from $21 million in the prior
quarter and $62 million in the second quarter of 2021.
Included in the appendix is additional detail on our investment portfolio and asset liability position. As Chris
mentioned, we have significant upside to higher interest rates over the next several years.
For example, if we were to reprice our existing $9.5 billion in short-term treasuries and $27 billion of swaps to
today's interest rates, we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over $700 million.
Moving to slide 9. Noninterest income was $688 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $750 million
for the year ago period and $676 million in the first quarter. As we mentioned in our mid-quarter update last
month, our fee income continues to be impacted by the slowdown in capital markets.
Investment banking and debt placement fees were $149 million for the quarter, down $14 million from the first
quarter. Compared to the prior period, offsetting the decline in investment banking fees was an increase of $15
million in the other income, mostly related to larger negative market-related adjustments in the prior quarter.
Commercial mortgage servicing fees also increased related to elevated prepayment fees. Year-over-year, in
addition to lower investment banking fees, cards and payments income was $28 million lower, primarily driven by
lower prepaid card revenue, which was partially offset by core growth.
Consumer mortgage income was also lower, reflecting higher balance sheet retention and lower gain on sale
margins. Strength in our corporate services income partially offset these declines.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
I'm now on slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, relatively stable with both last year
and the last quarter. Compared with the year ago quarter, our expenses were up $2 million. Personnel expenses
reflect lower production-related incentives and stock-based compensation, offset by higher salaries, including the
impact of our direct investments into the business.
On the non-personnel side, other expense increased $8 million and computer processing expense increased $7
million. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense is up $8 million.
Other expense was elevated, reflecting charges for lease terminations, higher travel and entertainment and FDIC
assessments. We also saw increases in marketing expense and net occupancy, which were more than offset
from lower personnel costs reflecting lower production-related incentives and stock-based compensation and
seasonally lower employee benefits expense.
Moving to slide 11. Overall credit quality remained strong. For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $44
million or 16 basis points of average loans. Nonperforming loans were $429 million this quarter or 38 basis points
of period-end loans, a decline of $10 million from the prior quarter.
Additionally, criticized loans declined and delinquencies were relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. Our allowance
for credit losses remained stable with last quarter. Keep in mind, we added to our reserves in the first quarter,
reflecting our expectation for a slowing economy. The reserve level is based on our continued strong credit
metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy.
Now on to slide 12. We ended the second quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.2%, within our targeted
range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their
borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.
We continue to manage our capital consistent with our capital priorities of: first, supporting organic growth in our
business. In this quarter, we certainly saw a strong loan growth across our franchise; second, paying dividends;
and third, repurchasing shares.
As Chris said, our board of directors just approved a quarterly common dividend of $0.195 per share for the third
quarter. As is our normal practice, the board will evaluate a dividend increase in the fourth quarter.
On slide 13 is our full year 2022 outlook. The guidance is relative to our full year 2021 results. To make
comparison easier, we provided both our prior guidance and our updated outlook, which is shown on the right-
hand side of the slide. Using the midpoints of our guidance ranges, would support Chris' comments about
delivering another year of positive operating leverage in 2022.
Average loans will be up between 9% and 11%. This is on a reported basis. Excluding PPP and the impact of the
sale of our indirect auto business last year, average loans will be up closer to 20%. We expect average deposits
to be up 1% to 3%. Net interest income is expected to be up between 10% and 12%, reflecting growth in average
loan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by lower fees from PPP forgiveness.
Our guidance is based on the forward curve, assuming a Fed funds rate of 3.5% by the end of 2022. Non-interest
income will be down between 10% and 12%. This reflects the slowdown in the capital markets and lower
investment banking revenue as well as lower prepaid card fees related to the government support program and a
step down in market-related adjustments relative to year ago period.

We expect non-interest expense to be down between 2% and 4%, reflecting lower production-related incentives
and our continued focus on strong expense management. Included in our outlook are our ongoing investments in
our business. For the year, we expect credit quality to remain strong and net charge-offs to be in the range of 15
to 25 basis points. Our guidance for our GAAP tax rate is approximately 19%.
Finally, shown on the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to
continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our
productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was a solid quarter, and we remain confident in our
ability to grow and deliver on our commitments.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess maybe first question, Don, I just wanted to go back to your comments around interest rate risk
management and the securities book, looking at the slide in the Appendix 17. Just talk to us when you talk about
the $700 million upside from repricing; one, what part of the curve is that sensitive to; and second, if interest rates
[ph] were more (19:11) lower in the next three to six months, is there a way to capture that NII upside?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
That's a great question. As far as the impact, I'm talking about $9.5 billion of our investment portfolio, which is in
our short-term treasuries. And that's just repricing those securities at basically a two-year yield on the assets. So
it's picking up over 200 basis points on that $9.5 billion. The other piece would be to reprice our swap book, which
7

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
is a little over $27 billion, and that has an average life of two and a half years. And just repricing that, combined
with the short-term treasuries, would yield over $700 million in run rate benefit.
As far as capturing that earlier, we always take a look to see how we can, and we've done some things such as
forward starting swaps and other things to position the portfolio to start to benefit from that in earlier quarters. But
we feel good about how we're positioned and with the opportunity to realize that over the next couple of years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess just a separate question on the outlook for loan growth. Obviously, seems like you're not
seeing any real signs of slowdown. Just talk to us in terms of how you're balancing customer demand, capital
market stuff [ph] moving to (20:28) the balance sheet versus the risk of a downturn and maybe we enter the
recession over the next 6 to 12 months, and how you're thinking about credit quality and just tightening the
underwriting books?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure, Ebrahim. Obviously, the time to prepare for any kind of a downturn is long before the downturn. And so if
you go back, over the last 10 years, we have been derisking Key. And if you look in areas like, for example,
housing and gateway cities, we've been dialing that back for some period of time.
The actions that we've taken more recently of course, is we exited indirect auto last year. We had a $3.3 billion
book that we exited. And then we are constantly looking at our portfolio, any place that there's leverage we focus
intently on. And we focus on certain places where we think there's been a run-up in asset values.
So for example, we've been dialing back loan-to-value percentages in places like the West. That kind of gives you
an idea. The notion of what goes on our balance sheet and what we distribute we do what's best for our clients.
And when you get into markets such as we have right now where there's dislocation, that's obviously an
opportunity, and we went from about 18% typically on our balance sheet up to 22%. And obviously, 4% of $36
billion is a lot.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the capital market side. So obviously, a tough
market environment to execute, obviously, you're talking still about strong pipeline. So can you just talk about just
how do you get a sense of what the revenue outlook looks like from here? And you obviously did some
adjustments on the cost side as a result as well. How much flexibility do you see on that side as well? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure, Ken. Good morning. Well, one of the things we really like about the business is it is a variable cost
business, and you saw that reflected in our expense numbers. In terms of the trajectory of the business, the
pipelines with the exception of equity, as you can well imagine, remained stronger this year than they did at this
time last year.
Having said that, the real challenge is going to be what is the actual yield. And as you think about, for example,
the M&A market, there's a disequilibrium right now between publicly-traded companies and where these private
companies are being priced, and there's a bit of price discovery.
I think it's going to take a while for that to shake out. But in my experience, it does shake out. And so I think the
back half, given – if we can get some cooperation from the markets, I think the back half will generate some
momentum. The other thing I will share with you about this business and you've been following us for a long time,
this is a business that we believe in and we'll continue to invest in. And it's been challenging, frankly, to be out in
the hiring market in this ride up in the last couple of years.
And so you'll see us invest in this business and hiring more people in sort of a flat or down market than we have in
the past. Thanks for your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it and one follow-up, if I may, the starting point here you had on – and interest-bearing deposit cost was really
excellent. Can you just talk about how you're expecting that to traject as obviously, we get into the media part of
the magnitude of rate raises? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Sure, Ken, you're right that the starting point here that we haven't seen a lot of pressure on deposit rates. And so
we've got a very low beta for the quarter as a 2 basis point increase in – and average interest-bearing deposit
costs compared to about a 60 basis point increase in the LIBOR would suggest about a 3.5% to 4% deposit beta.
We think the incremental betas will increase from here going forward. And by the end of the year, as we talked
about in the last call, we do expect that incremental beta towards the end of the year to be closer to that 30%
range that – so that's really our expectations. We'll start to see more customer changes and more competition for
deposit rates going forward.

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Good morning, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone. So looking at the updated guidance and specifically I'm looking at the 9% to 11%
loan growth and 1% to 3% decline in deposits, which is a pretty wide mismatch, how do you plan to fund loan
growth beyond 2022? And at what loan-to-deposit ratio do you need to start fully funding loan growth one for one
with deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Steve, this is Don. And as far as the loan growth, you're right. The updated guidance is 9% to 11%. Deposits are
expected to be up 1% to 3% year-over-year. That implies relatively stable deposits through the rest of the year.
We do have some investment security maturities. We also will tap the wholesale market as far as funding that one
of the benefits of originating residential real estate loans adds to our capacity as far as borrowing at the home
loan and we can do that in a cost effective way.
Loan-to-deposit ratios were currently below 80% on our balance sheet. Typically, we would target between 90%
and 95% loan-to-deposit ratio. So we've got plenty of room to work through that. I would say that we'll continue to
monitor this. But as Chris has highlighted a couple of times, we want to support our customers. And in these
markets, we're going to see more customer demand for loans than we are probably going to see for capital
markets opportunities. And so, we'll continue to see that. We could see that reverse at some point in time. And
help alleviate some of the pressure on loan growth overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Don, how do we think about this? So at some point, you'll reach a loan-to-deposit ratio
where you need to be more competitive on deposits. And I heard your response to Ken's question, you think you'll
be at 30% or so loan deposit beta by end of this year. But if we keep moving it forward, what do you think is the
through the cycle deposit beta?
And Chris, just given your commentary that you feel good that NIM higher rates are going to benefit you long-
term, do you think your loan beta can stay consistently above the incremental deposit beta as we move forward
beyond 2022?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
I think it can. And the reason I said I think, as we go into an inevitable downturn and clearly, the economy is
slowing, I think you're going to see sort of a repricing of risk, and I think we'll be in a good position with the
relationships that we have to garner that. And so, I think the answer to your question is, I think it will.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
And then loan-to-deposit side as well, historically, we would have had a deposit beta of around 40% to 45%. And I
would say that our deposit mix is much different today than what it was during the last rate increase cycle, that on
the consumer side, we're very focused on core primacy accounts or operating accounts for the consumer as
opposed to historically we might have been more focused on promotional money market type of products and
programs. And so we should see less interest rate sensitivity there.
On the commercial side, we're seeing now 85% of our deposits are in core operating accounts, and that's
probably up 5 to 10 points from what it was just three years ago. So that mix should be helpful for us to continue
to manage that beta down longer term compared to what the historic levels were for us. And so, we will probably
drift above that 30% level, but I think we'll be well below that 40% to 45% level that we were historically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And Don, if I could squeeze one more in, so the 85% of commercial deposits are operating accounts, is the
implication from that, that we shouldn't expect much of a mix shift out of non-interest bearing? Is that the read-
through from that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
Well, we'll see some shift there just because of the impact of the higher rates and earnings crediting rate that we
provide to help manage fees. And so as rates go up, you might see less of a need to keep some of the funds
there and they might look to put some of those in other interest-bearing categories, but it still does imply that we'll
see less shift than what we would have historically just because of the higher level of operating account balances.

My first question is on credit quality, which is clearly pristine currently. Chris, you said to Ebrahim that the time to
prepare for a downturn is well before the downturn hits. And maybe help us understand how we should think
about how Key's ACL would look like in a recession.
So you ended the quarter at 1.13% and clearly, your book has changed, but you also have more consumer loans,
which, even if the credit is good, my understanding is from a CECL standpoint, they have longer lives, right? So I
guess the question here is, if we do have a mild recession next year or sooner than that, where would this ACL
ratio trend?

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
So obviously – first of all good morning, Erika. Obviously we're really comfortable with where our reserves are
today. A few things to keep in mind, both on our commercial and our consumer side, I'll start with the consumer.
That book of business at funding is about – FICO scores of about 780. So it's a little bit of a unique customer base
as it relates to our consumers. So that's one thing to keep in mind. The other thing on the commercial side, as I've
mentioned earlier, we've been consistently derisking all of Key. And we also have been consistently laying off
about 72% of the risk that kind of flows through Key. And there were a lot of deals that we're able to place that
don't meet our moderate risk profile.
So I'm very comfortable with where our reserves are now. As you can imagine, we are modeling continually just a
whole lot of different scenarios. But at the moment, we're very comfortable with where our reserve is. You'll recall,
last quarter, we actually increased our qualitative reserve just on the premise that, under CECL, our macro view
had changed and clearly there were some more challenges out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice-Chair, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Member-Executive Leadership Team & Member-Executive Council, KeyCorp
And Erika, this is Don. I can probably add a little bit more color to that as well. And that if you look at our
allowance, it is very quantitative in the approach. I would say that under CECL, what you do is take a look at the
foreseeable period as far as forecasted losses. And so for us, that's a two-year type of period. And so even in a
recession, you would see those two years of losses go up from where they're at today. And then we'll start to
migrate back to the norm.
And so, you might think that with the longer life loans as far as the residential real estate or even our student
loans to Laurel Road, that you would see that for the entire life. And you really would. You would see it spike in
that first two year period. And so, it might imply somewhere between a 40 or 50 basis point kind of increase to the
allowance, but it wouldn't be a doubling, it would be our best guess at this point in time.

Got it. And Chris, maybe a follow-up question for you. As we take a step back, you and your colleagues have built
Key into this powerhouse, super-regional commercial and corporate bank. And I think a lot of investors are
thinking that a lot of the issues in credit and corporate from higher rates and lower EBITDA, perhaps, may come

outside of the banking system. And given your comments about derisking, is there any room at KeyCorp for
perhaps some market share gains if you do see some blowups in the private credit markets? Or are those deals
just deals that you wouldn't be comfortable with any way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Well, I think there is no question that depending on how people are funded, I think banks, in general, will be able
to gain share. And the nice thing about a downturn, Erika, is you can have things structured the way you want to
structure them to put them on your balance sheet. I think there's no question that, in this location, it will be an
opportunity for us to gain market share given our relationships and given that we can have things structured the
way we'd like them to structure, because the market is obviously adjusting as we speak.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning.

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Good morning.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So your capital is kind of right in the middle of your range at 9.2% versus 9% to 9.5%. Can you just update us on
– thoughts on both share buybacks? And then also, where you want to be within that capital range at this point of
cycle and maybe longer term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure, Matt. So, we're obviously very comfortable at 9.2%. Frankly, I'd be comfortable at even a range that's a little
broader than that. 9% to 9.5% was just an internal range that we had put in place. As it relates to capital actions,
first and foremost, as Don mentioned in his remarks, we preserve our capital to help our clients grow. So that's
the first thing.
The second thing is obviously our dividend, which is very important. And then, our third tertiary priority is the
repurchase of shares. And so, I feel very good about where we are from a capital perspective.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
All right. And then somewhat related, as you mentioned earlier about investing even more so within the
investment banking, capital markets broadly speaking. Is that all kind of organic? Or are there may be some niche
acquisition opportunities within those businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Well, as you know, in the past, we have bought businesses, and I'm really proud of our ability to integrate these
entrepreneurial businesses. But what I was really focused on in my comments is sort of organic individual hires
that we think would be a good cultural fit to plug into our platform.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Sure, Matt.

Operator: And we have last question here from the line of Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. So, it's not a new statement from you, but if you can't catch the ball with your left hand with investment
banking then you catch it with your right hand with traditional lending or the re-intermediation to bank balance
sheets from capital markets.
So I know you've described this in the past, Chris, and this is your old area, as we all know. But can you be more
specific like what are we talking about? We say capital market transactions don't get completed. So therefore,
they go to Key's balance sheet. Just a little bit more detail would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Sure. So let me give you an example. Say someone is trying to privately raise debt and there's all these debt
funds and there's all these unitranche offerings. And all of a sudden, those markets frees up. But whoever is the
sponsor behind the deal has significant capital.
We can then go back to the parties involved who we have a relationship with and we would say, we won't
structure it the way – we're trying to structure it to place it out in the market, but we'd be pleased to put a very
conservative amount of debt on our balance sheet, and you, sponsor, will need to come up with more equity. That
would be an example.
Another example would be a company that we were going to take public that we could continue to fund in a
variety of ways until they go public. A third example would be, a large – let's say it's a large, affordable project that
14

wanted ultimately to place the paper with one of the agencies. But because of dislocation, you couldn't do that.
That's a deal that we could bridge over a period of time with a known takeout. That would be a few examples.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And your investment banking fees were down less than the biggest players, down one-third versus down
one-half. I guess that's partly just due to your mix, upper middle market. But the decline was not as much first
quarter to second quarter. You said you expect things to improve.
Now I mean, maybe your guess is as good as anyone else's? Or perhaps you have some extra insight or maybe
you hear what your clients are saying, but – and with that backdrop, how are you allocating resources? You said
you're going to be investing more than you have in the past. Does that reflect your optimism?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, KeyCorp
Mike, there's no question I'm optimistic about the business long term. Mike, as you know, how these markets play
out over the next six months is, in fact, anybody's guess. But we're playing the long game. We're investing in the
business.
The pipelines are there. I don't see anything happening in the equity market, for example, in the next three or six
months. I do think this price discovery that I discussed earlier in the M&A market, I do think that buyers and
sellers will start to come together on that.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thank you.
