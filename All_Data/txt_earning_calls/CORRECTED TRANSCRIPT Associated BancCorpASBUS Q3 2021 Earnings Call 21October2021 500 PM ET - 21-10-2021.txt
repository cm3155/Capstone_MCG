Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Well, thank you, Shomali. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm
Andy Harmening, and I'm joined today by Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, Our Chief Credit
Officer. I want to kick things off by covering the macro highlights for the quarter and give you an update on the
strategic initiatives that we presented both internally and externally last month. Then Chris will walk you through
where we are in margin, fees and expenses. And then finally Pat will close us out with an update on credit.
On a macro level, we continue to see signs of a strengthening economy in our markets. Unemployment rates in
Wisconsin and Minnesota remained at or below 4% and manufacturing has been consistently expanding which is
reflected in the positive momentum we're seeing in the Midwestern footprint.
While the third quarter news cycle is dominated by over concerns of surging Delta variant and supply chain
challenges, we do remain optimistic about growth in the latter part of this year and into next. Our customers are
doing well. Sound credit performance continues to be foundational and Associated is well positioned to participate
in the coming expansion.
Now let me touch on third quarter highlights, as outlined on slide 2. On the top line, we saw revenue expansion
across all key areas of our business. Interest income grew, our fee businesses grew and we realized additional
gains during the quarter. We also see signs of increasing customer confidence with spending activity, deposit
levels and capital market transactions all up from the second quarter.
On the liability side, rising deposit levels have also allowed us to further moderate our funding costs. Now, shifting
to credit, we continue to benefit from improving credit backdrop as we work our way through 2021. Our customers
have proven to be resilient and markets have continued to recover throughout the year. After posting reserve
releases in each of quarter one and quarter two, we posted another negative provision in the third quarter and
further net reserve release.
Our CECL reserves are now below our CECL day 1 levels. From an operating expense perspective we continue
to be disciplined even as we embark on our multiple initiatives. And aside from the $2 million of facility exit costs
we incurred in Q3, expenses were fairly flat. Taken together, these factors helped us drive our year-to-date
returns on average tangible common equity to over 13%.
Moving to slide 3, I want to divestiture a little deeper in the loans. We shared back in Q2 that we were starting to
see signs of increased lending activity and line utilization in our commercial portfolios. And I'm pleased to
announce that this trend has carried over into the third quarter.
Average commercial and business lending loans, excluding PPP, grew by over 3% quarter-over-quarter led by
general commercial. Additionally, we continue to see growth in several specialized lending categories as CRE
construction. While certain aspects of the economy faced unexpected headwinds during the quarter due to
resurgence of COVID, we continue to be encouraged by the conversations we're having on the frontline and the
numbers that are starting to merge in our pipelines.
We're also encouraged by customer activity, consumer activity. We officially launched our Auto Finance vertical in
September 30 and have already funded loans across 13 states. We are excited about the early returns in our auto
business. This addition to our product set allows us to further diversify our consumer lending portfolio and earn
slightly better spreads in our traditional mortgage origination activities.
Consumer card spending activity was also remarkably strong during the quarter. Outstanding credit card balances
increased 6% quarter-over-quarter, a greater than 24% annualized rate suggesting a significant uptick in the

confidence of our retail customers. And finally, our PPP and oil and gas portfolios continue to run off as expected,
we expect the majority of our remaining PPP to be paid down in Q4, and we expect the oil and gas portfolio to be
largely paid down over the coming year. Additional loan trends for the third quarter are highlighted on slide 4.
On a longer term trend, we're pleased to see commercial and business lending rebound during the quarter,
reflecting our first expansion in more than five quarters. Line utilization was a contributor to the rebound.
Commercial line utilization numbers continue to close the gap relative to our historical levels. In April, our
commercial customers are funding about 12.5 percentage points below our historic line utilization levels. By
September, this gap had narrowed to 8.5 percentage points.
And while we still remain well below our pre-COVID monthly averages, our September line utilization was the
highest we've seen since July of 2020, and our momentum coming out of the August lull we experienced seems
to be establishing a positive trend.
Construction lending was also a bright spot for the quarter as our proactive commercial real estate team continue
to grow both outstandings and commitments on a year-over-year basis. And given our substantial back book and
construction commitments, we're confident outstandings will continue to grow well into late 2022.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we remain optimistic around loan growth but are adjusting our expectation in
response to the economic headwinds that played out in the third quarter. Specifically, we now expect full-year
commercial growth, that is CRE and C&I combined excluding PPP, of approximately 2%.
On slide 5, we provided a walk forward of our quarterly pre-tax pre-provision income from the second quarter to
the third quarter. And while our pre-tax income was essentially flat for the quarter, this masked the $9 million
improvement in our pre-tax pre-provision results and our positive operating leverage. Looking past the $11 million
drop in provisioning, both interest income and fee income items were significant contributors to our quarter-over-
quarter improvement.
I mentioned last quarter that we expected expansion in pre-tax pre-provision income over the second half of 2021
to more than cover the incremental cost contemplated for our newly announced initiatives. We remain committed
to these targets as we head into Q4.
Now turning to slide 6, I'd like to highlight that we announced our strategic vision back in September. We said
we'd start executing on our strategies immediately. And we have. Slide 6 shows some of the steps we've taken to
make real progress against the four key pillars of our strategic plan. We continue to expand our lending
capabilities.
Our Auto Finance business is up and running, with book loans and nearly 750 dealer partners signed up. We are
currently originating loans in a pilot mode across 13 states and 60 dealers. Origination activity to date has been in
line with our expectations, and we'd be looking to ramp up our volumes as we move through Q4 and roll out our
program to our broader dealer network.
In addition, we've rounded out the executive leadership team for both our Equipment Finance and our Asset-
Based Lending initiatives. We continued to add experienced relationship managers and lending specialists into
our core markets to better serve the needs of our commercial and small business customers. And we brought
increased focus to our wealth management areas, while targeting new opportunities across our footprint.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
On the digital front, we're on track to transform our consumer digital banking experience in the first quarter with
the launch of a new platform, bringing increased customization and architecture that more easily allow us to
integrate fintech partners to improve the customer experience. This is our first big step in a plan that will transition
spending towards our digital channels and technology over the next several years.
And finally, we're always looking for ways to optimize our capital and balance sheet. And in the third quarter
alone, we redeemed $100 million of preferred stock, repurchased $60 million of common stock, and increased our
common dividend by 11%. Simply put, we are full steam ahead on our efforts and we look forward to building on
this momentum as we head into 2022.
So let me pause there and hand it over to Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide further detail on our
margin and income statement trends for the quarter. Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 7, our net interest income increased $4 million from the prior quarter or 2%, driven
by higher interest income across the board and lower funding and time deposit costs. Our quarterly net interest
margin increased slightly, expanding 1 basis point quarter-to-quarter. We've seen slowing refinance activity which
has stabilized our mortgage yields and a steady decline in liability costs. NIM continued to be pressured by high
liquidity levels and compressed commercial loan yields.
Moving to slide 8, we continue to see record average deposit levels. Third quarter average deposits were up over
$1.2 billion or 5% on a year-over-year basis. This growth continued to be concentrated in our low-cost deposit
categories. Low-cost deposits have grown approximately $2 billion from a year ago; and at quarter-end accounted
for 67% of our total deposits.
During the quarter, we continued to work down our high-cost network and time deposit balances. This decreased
by approximately $1.3 billion from the third quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, our aggregate and wholesale funding
levels have continued to steadily decrease over the past five quarters, and have decreased by nearly $2 billion
year-over-year. Looking forward, the deposit pricing and funding actions we have taken are anticipated to help
improve our margins in Q4 and into 2022.
Turning to slide 9. Given the high levels of liquidity, we began investing in securities late in Q3. We anticipate
deploying additional cash balances into investment securities over the next nine months. Reinvestment yields are
expected to be approximately 2% or better, and accretive to our current portfolio earnings. We continue to target
investments and total assets ratio of between 17% and 19% for 2021, and expect to rebuild the investment
portfolio to somewhere north of 20% of assets by year-end 2022. Looking forward, we expect our full year margin
to end this year at approximately 2.40% for the full year.
Now, turning to slide 10. I will comment on non-interest income trends. Fee income grew nicely during the quarter.
We saw growth across several key categories, including our mortgage banking unit where net income grew $3
million from the prior quarter assisted by MSR recoveries. We also saw solid growth in our fee-based revenues
where service charges on deposits and account fees were up 9% for the quarter and up 19% year-over-year.
Card-based fees were also up 9%.
Taken together, we view these trends as encouraging indicators of growth – growing consumer confidence as we
emerge from the pandemic. Our non-interest income for the quarter also included $5 million in asset gains tied to
private equity distributions. But even excluding this impact, income grew by nearly 5% from the previous quarter.

Reflecting a continued strength in our core fee businesses, we now expected to finish 2021 at the upper end of
our most recent fee guidance range.
On slide 11, we highlight our expenses. The third quarter came in at $178 million, a $3 million increase from the
prior quarter, including $2 million of facilities exit costs. Excluding these exit costs, expenses were up about $1
million. As we continue to roll out our new strategic initiatives, we remain committed to maintaining our expense
management discipline. Taking into consideration all the pending initiative actions, we continue to expect our total
2021 noninterest expense to come in consistent with our prior guidance range.
Lastly, let me comment on capital. As shown on slide 12, our tangible book value per share continues to grow
quarter-over-quarter, and has increased 7% year-over-year to $17.58. Associated regulatory capital levels all
remained strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio has grown from the third quarter 2020 even as we referred to
shares redeemed for third and increased the dividend. We will continue to target TCE levels at or above 7.5% and
CET1 at or above 9.5%.
With that, let me turn it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, speaking updates on credit portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Chris. I want to start by providing an update on our allowance, as shown on slide 13. We utilized the
Moody's September 2021 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline
forecast assumes additional fiscal support, a continuing low interest rate environment, the recent acceleration in
consumer prices to be transitory, and relatively localized COVID cases.
Following net reserve releases of $28 million and $40 million in the first and second quarters of 2021,
respectively, we posted a further net release of $32 million in the third quarter. This net release was driven by
gross reductions in our allowance for all of our core commercial and CRE business units, with a $3 million gross
reduction in our allowance related to our general and commercial and business lending portfolio, a $12 million
reduction in our CRE allowance, a $14 million reduction in oil and gas, and a $2 million reduction in retail lending.
As of September 30, our total ACLL was $332 million, down from $364 million in the prior quarter. Furthermore,
our ratio of reserves to loans declined to 1.41% from $1.52% during the quarter. We had previously guided that
we expected ACLL to loans to drop back down to CECL Day 1 levels by the end of 2021. And three quarters of
the way through the year, we've dropped comfortably below that mark.
Turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide 14. Most of our key credit metrics continued to improve
over the course of the quarter. Our key COVID commercial exposures continued to decline for the quarter, led by
declines in our retailer and shopping center exposures. Nonaccrual loans also decreased in Q3 and were down
42% year-over-year.
Net charge offs increased slightly from the quarter and we're tied to only one credit. Potential problem loans also
increased with the increases tied to continued pressure in some select COVID-related industries. We expect
these trends to normalize as we get into 2022. For the fourth quarter, we expect to adjust provision to reflect
changes to risk ratings, economic conditions, other indications of credit quality and loan value.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to round out the final quarter
of 2021.

Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. On slide 15, we recap our updated guidance for 2021. Amid the economic headwinds we face in the
back half of the year, we are expecting full year commercial loan growth, excluding PPP, to come in at
approximately 2%. We expect our full year net interest margin to land at approximately 2.4% due to elevated
liquidity levels and compressed commercial loan yields. And we expect to finish 2021 at the upper end of the
$315 million to $325 million range we gave for noninterest income back in September, reflecting continued
strength in our core fee businesses over the remainder of the year.
And lastly, as I mentioned, we continue to experience positive credit trends due to economic conditions as we –
and as such, we expect fourth quarter provisioning to be adjusted to reflect changes to risk grade, economic
conditions, and other indications of credit quality and loan volume.
And with that, we'd be happy to take any of your questions.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see, Chris, I wanted to maybe start with you just on
the plan to deploy the $1 billion-plus of excess liquidity over the nine months or so. Can you talk a little bit about
sort of your preference for what you'd like to buy relative to the current composition of the portfolio and sort of
what the interest rate assumptions are or what kind of rate environment will be necessary to be able to hit those
sort of targeted reinvestment rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, I think the mix, overall, Scott, will look a lot like what you see in our current portfolio, and won't be a
fundamental change from what we've been doing for the last couple of years, just adding a little more volume.
And from a yield perspective, we've called out that we think that reinvestment portfolio yields will be in the 2%-
plus range, which is consistent with what we purchased in September...

R. Scott Siefers Q

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Excellent. So, it doesn't depend on further increase in the long end of the curve or anything like that, just sort of
static environment would be great?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
A static environment, we can achieve and deliver on this investment plan; and a great move higher, that would be
even better.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. Okay. Good. And then can you let us know what the remaining PPP fees are that will flow through NII
and margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, I think we detailed that on slide 4 in the materials. And so, at the end – of the press release table, that's
what I meant, sorry. That's $7 million and, again, we think the majority of that will come off. That doesn't mean all
of it, but just for clarity, something probably more than half of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Sorry, I missed that. And I think I missed that last quarter as well. So, appreciate you

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I wanted to just touch base on the commercial loan growth. I think you've highlighted a lot of positives in terms of
utilization rates moving higher, good demand in construction funding moving forward, et, cetera; but then on the
flip side, maybe moving down the kind of the lower end of the targeted range from month or two ago. So, could
you just talk about what's driving that? Is that payoffs or competition in the market or demand? Any color would be
helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. This is Andy. I'll take that one. As we look at the fourth quarter, we have a few things. We've had very
modest increase on line utilization so far. It's not been a major driver. When you look at the fourth quarter, you
have to look at mortgage warehouse and what the impact of rates will be to that part of portfolio. And then we
have oil and gas which we expect to run down and is running down. So, when you look at all of those pieces
together and you see that little bit of a low in the third quarter, we believe that drives us down to the lower end of
the range.
But at the same time, what I would say is our commercial pipelines remained strong. So, we feel good about the
fundamental business heading in the fourth quarter, and we feel very good about the state of our initiatives
heading into the first quarter as we get new relationships managers up and running and they're already taking
looks at deals folks we didn't have in the field before. So, that's the primary driver down for the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just as my follow up. Chris, as rates started to move up, especially on the
long end of the curve, does that change how you're looking at any loan categories, maybe like longer duration
residential, real estate or anything like that that you're kind of looking at differently, especially as it pertains to kind
of the capital allocation model that you're bringing to bear?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So I would say, this – I don't think it changes what we're looking at differently. We had already strategically
begun to reposition ourselves in expectation of rising rates gently over time away from mortgage, which we have
seen less volume and less applications on, and which we've said we would hold the balances there static going
forward, and shifting towards more shorter duration but still fixed rate assets such as the Auto, such as the
Equipment Finance which are going to come online and are poised to benefit from the repricing. And we continue
to expect to participate, as our customers will, in general C&I repricing and CRE repricing over time.

Andrew J. Harmening A

That is helpful, and your line is still open. This is Andy Harmening. I have some skills as moderator as well. And
I'd be happy to take the next question. If you've got anything for us, happy to answer it
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
I'll throw one out there, nothing else to stall. Just on the network deposits as a factor, kind of moving forward into
a higher rate environment, that's historically been kind of a nice buffer for you guys to pull on when you needed
the funding. But can you just talk about that again, maybe in the context of potentially rising rates going forward.
And I think we're a long way from liquidity scarcity, but just as you think about that on a go-forward basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We've been able to, I mean, nicely maintain our core deposits. As you can see that we've maintained it at a
pretty low level. Our customer satisfaction coming off of last year's, those satisfaction scores remained pretty
strong, which is also a key driver of retention. So, we believe that the networks are a big positive for us, whether
that's in community markets that are very – they play a very key factor or major metropolitan markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, just so we're all on the same page. The core funding levels have reflected very positive dynamics and
the low-cost as Andy has articulated. The network deposits that come to us from the large mutual fund complexes
and the broker-dealers, those deposits we've been working directly with those providers to manage those
balances down, and you see that on slide 8 and how we've managed those balances down.

But we have endeavored to keep relationships open with each of the large dealers, so that should the market
come back in a way that would require us to act as incremental funding, we would still have good access there.
And we've tried to manage the largest providers to be the largest remaining components of our current
outstanding, so that we're active with them, we remain active in their flow. And when the market necessitates that
we may need incremental funding, we hope we'll have ready and easy access to those same large providers that
support us as we grow in, say, 2023 or 2024 when liquidity perhaps starts to take a turn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think I was taking that from a different perspective which is, we have optionality but we also have the strength of
branch network deposits outside of additional network deposits that are still available.

Q
I'd be happy if Andy could take this next question. This is a first for me.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Let me know if you get the operator back, but I'll guess I'll just continue. Just on share buyback, obviously good to
see some strong utilization this quarter. Stocks a little bit higher than where it's probably been throughout 3Q. So,
just – is there still pretty strong appetite there or at some point do you start to lean more heavily on an escalating
dividend or do you look at M&A, kind of how are you walking through the capital allocation bucket?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I'm going to – this is Andy. I'll take the first part of that. And what I would say is our focus is on growth. We
think that's the best, most profitable way to advance the company. And so, as we head into 2022, we feel really
good about the trajectory that we have of the initiatives and our core businesses where we've been able to add
commercial bankers and small business bankers. We felt like we had an opportunity in the short term as we're
getting that ramped up towards year-end to maximize our capital position, and we're in position to buy back stock.
If there is a situation where there is some slowdown, then we'll remain – we'll give ourselves that optionality, but
our number one priority is growth. Chris
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
You said it well. First, organic growth. Second, maintain a competitive dividend. And we think with the actions we
took in the third quarter, we enhanced our competitive dividend positioning. Third, looking at inorganic
opportunities, but the internal organic is the key focus there, so they're downplayed for the moment. And we'll
always look at share repurchase as a use of incremental capital. But frankly, with the plans we have for organic
growth, we have a good use case to deploy our capital in the near-term towards those initiatives.

Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you. Again, if there's another question out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Are other people connected or are you guys able to open other lines, or we just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think that we – our moderator, Shomali, has been disconnected momentarily, so he can't reposition the
line. So, I think right now others can hear us, but you are...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. Well, I'll sit back so others can ask questions if they're able.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So for our analysts that are online, feel free to send your email questions directly in to Ben McCarville.
That's ben.mccarville@associatedbank.com. I think most of you have his information handy, and we'll be sure to
answer them in queue order as they come along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I hope you hear from this series of events that we're really better at operating a bank than we are serving as
moderators, but we're trying like heck to do it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
So, I will say we have a couple of questions that came through from Scott Siefers, additional questions that came
through from Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
And I'll recite the first one here. So, what will be the amount of strategic initiative charges in 4Q 2021? I think you
took $2 million in charges in the third quarter, but I've been saying $8 million for full year 2021. So, $6 million
remaining and embedded in the full year 2021 guide.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I think that's the right way to think about it, Scott. So, we're changing our – we're not changing our full guide so
that leaves us that amount that you've articulated there as a likely range of outcomes. We're obviously working
through those and we'll be diligent and disciplined about managing those as appropriately. But our total expense
guide is unchanged.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Next one from Scott, what was the 28% linked-quarter increase in potential problem loans this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Pat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So those were really, as I mentioned, tied to what we call COVID-related industries. Some movie theater
exposure, hospitality, transportation, et cetera. It's really a handful of select deals that we don't see as a systemic
increase over the portfolio. It was just really very select credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Also from Scott, what type of wage inflation are you seeing and can you absorb it within your existing efficiency
initiatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Great question. It's something we're all seeing. As you probably noticed last week, we noticed – we
announced a wage increase across our entire footprint effective November 21. That wage increase has already
been budgeted for, and we believe we have appropriate plans in place for 2022. So we can absorb what we see
as increases going forward pretty effectively, and the good news is we've had very nice success on turnover year-
over-year relative to other – what we're hearing in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Okay. Last question from Scott. The provision guidance is less specific than usual. Your 1.41% reserve is below
the CECL day 1 of 1.55% and I know energy was a portion of that. Are we done with the negative provisions?
Should we assume that without meaningful economic changes we'll keep the 1.4%, if it is, we'll keep pace with
loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So this is Chris Niles. Let me give a first response to that. So we've given the more broad guidance because we
think going forward, our provision will be more economic and portfolio factor-driven. That having been said, we
feel very comfortable with where we are at the end of the quarter. We think the reserve is appropriate. But we also

see some good overall dynamics and we won't be necessarily expecting significant negative pressure over the
near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
All right. Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. What is your expense guidance for Q4, trying
to get a better idea of impact of prior one-time items?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So our expense guidance is for the full year on a total basis. So you can take our total guidance, subtract the first
three quarters, and that'll be the fourth quarter guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I think the other thing that – to state there is as we launched multiple initiatives, what we committed to is having
positive operating leverage above the second quarter. We clearly did that in Q3 and we expect to do that again in
Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Positive pre-tax pre-provision above the $78 million that we outlined.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
And then we have a few here from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. So first question is when do you think
commercial loan yields can bottom out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I'd like to think they already have. Now, that's a bit over my skis. But the reality is we're beginning to see
market yields generally rise and we take comfort in what we've seen as some of the larger bank syndicated
transactions that have come out where they started to build in SOFR adjustments and other factors that this
perhaps the compression in spreads that we've been experiencing that's driven absolute yields to the bottoms, we
hope is perhaps behind us. And whilst spreads may not expand, absolute yield will continue to rise if market
levels rise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I think the other thing that's a tailwind potentially is as we see this slow steady increase in utilization, that typically
comes with an improved margin as well. So it's impossible to say on the forward-looking exactly what bottom
looks like but more to come.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
All right. So next up from Jon, are you still planning on $1 billion in auto outstandings by the end of 2022?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We're very much believing we're on track to be able to achieve that. We are three weeks into it. We – at the
writing of this presentation, we were at 60 dealers. Since then, I had a call yesterday afternoon and it looks like
we've raised that to 211 dealers in the pilot. So, we are on track for that number. And we expect incremental
increases in November and December, and that will really hit the ground running very well in January.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Also from Jon, if you exclude warehouse and energy, are you more bullish on commercial lending for 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. I mean, the simple answer is yes. We've brought over some talented relationship, managers across
Wisconsin and Chicago so far in a pretty short period of time. In addition to that, when you think about the
markets that we're in, they're tailor-made for asset-based lending and Equipment Finance. We are looking at
deals already in asset-based lending having had the leader in that join us in the third quarter.
Equipment Finance, we were ramping up quickly. In fact, I met with our head of Equipment Finance this afternoon
on his first day in the office to talk about how we bring a team around ramping that up as quickly as possible. And
it's a seasoned veteran, Scott Dienes, who comes to us from Wells Fargo and GE Capital. So, those are pieces
that we don't have in our numbers today in the third quarter that we expect heading into first quarter we will have.
And in spite of that, we continue to see a really nice pipeline. We saw commercial increase of 3% in the third
quarter and we maintained a very nice pipeline in commercial even with the closings that we had there. So,
feeling very bullish on our commercial business heading into first quarter and 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
All right. So, a couple here that I might blend together on Jon's [indiscernible] (37:30) I hope it's okay. So, it
seems like the margin should be up nicely in 2022; and more broadly, when are you willing to talk about your
outlook for 2022 overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, Jon, we've historically given our 2022 guidance in our January 2022 call. So you can expect to hear from us
then. But obviously, we will be presenting at a conference later this quarter and we'll perhaps give you a little
more update on our strategic initiatives at that time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
All right. So next up we have a couple of questions from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. So first of all, how will the
FTE count change from the day Andy joined until the day that your hirings are done with the initiatives?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Sure. When you think about the overall FTE counts, we're roughly at 4,000 in the second quarter, 3,990 in the
press release tables. We're just over 4,010 now. So, they really haven't changed much, but the new hires and the
additional staff to support all of our initiatives will raise the overall count by a couple hundred, including some
backfill open positions that we need to work on as well. So you can expect the overall count to go up by several
hundred.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Next from Terry, what markets have you hired commercial bankers in and what markets are still on the drawing
board?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, we've hired lenders in Chicago, we've hired lenders in Milwaukee, we've hired a couple in Northeast
Wisconsin which we thought were very strong. So, primarily so far in Chicago, Milwaukee and then Northeast
Wisconsin and Central Wisconsin. We think there'll still be opportunity in Minneapolis on the hiring front and we
intend to keep moving forward on that front.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
The next question that we have is from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. With the reduction in NIM guidance
offset by the balance sheet growth, how do you think of our overall net interest income growth now relative to a
quarter ago? Can you provide more details from the NIM improvement comments you made?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So I think we'd refer you to the guidance slide, where we also highlighted that not only do we expect to be at
the upper end of our fee range, but we expect to be within the total revenue range that we had previously
provided at the Barclays presentation conference. And so, the difference obviously between the total revenue and
the fee guidance is the net interest income. So, it's a fairly robust number and I think you'll find it pretty easy to
derive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Our next question comes from [ph] Jonathan Robb (40:16) with Wells Fargo. What is the duration on the
securities you're purchasing as you build the investment portfolio? Also, what would the duration go to in a 200
basis point plus rate scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So [ph] Jonathan (40:31), as I mentioned, the mix of securities that we're purchasing is very similar to the
mix of our current portfolio. There'll be a little bit longer duration on the new mortgages purchased than the
existing book obviously, but similar duration on the munis. And so, that will be a little lengthening a little bit beyond
sort of the five year that you've seen from us historically, but not much.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
And with regard to what that would do in an up 200 basis points rate shock, I don't have the immediate number at
my hands. But suffice it to say, with a five-year duration, a 200 basis point shock is mathematically about a 10-
point swing in value. That having been said, I'm not seeing anything in the 10-year yield profile or the forwards
that would indicate that's a consensus view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
All right. I have a few more questions here in my inbox. But if you have any others, feel free to send them along
here. Moving on, we have a follow-up from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. According to other banks, mortgage
yields are less than auto yields, but auto is a non-relationship business. How would you respond to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
What I would say right now is, our mortgage book consists of both originated and third-party originations. And so,
the third-party origination expansion is not necessary for us and there's opportunity on the indirect auto portion of
that to get a yield that is better than what we had before.
So from an Associated Bank standpoint, it puts us in a really good position in a market that has seen the
downturn probably in mortgage origination across the industry in 2022 to quickly transpose that. But I'd point out
that we have pretty significant expectations in very customer-friendly relationship businesses of small business
and commercial banking. And that was on purpose. We believe those are massive deposit engines. And in
addition to that, we have an initiative that we haven't talked as much about and that's the mass affluent initiative
which provides typically 70% to 75% of a retail bank's deposit base. So we have an upside in gathering deposits
from those customers as well.
So, in terms of what it means for us, it's a bit of a mix switch out and a trend on mortgage, while simultaneously
having to plan around deposits on mass affluent and entering very heavy deposit industries of small business and
commercial banking middle market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben McCarville A
Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Associated Banc-Corp
Great. All right. And then we have two remaining questions. Next one is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. So
you had suggested a 2.75% steady state NIM over three plus years with your September strategic initiative
announcement. Do you still feel comfortable with that expectation in light of how long excess liquidity is sticking
around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I think the question on excess liquidity. Look, there's some indications that typically when you see some
spend and you see some account fee increases, that's typically a leading indicator that something – that there
may be a decrease in deposits over time. We're seeing that.
So, absent stimulus, while those have been sticky for us through three quarters and have been through the whole
entire – in the entire industry, heading into 2022, I think there's some signs of that being a decrease. So, overall
right now, I would say that we are still committed to that, the margin that we laid out in our midterm plan.
