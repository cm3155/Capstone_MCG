Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and
support. We're pleased with our full-year 2019 results and the continued momentum across the bank despite a
challenging operating environment.
For the full year, we reported earnings per common share of $1.27, an increase of 6% over 2018. Return on
average assets for 2019 was 1.3%, return on average common equity was 13%, and return on average tangible
common equity was 17%. The bank achieved record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive
operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year.
Our balance sheet is very well-positioned with robust capital and liquidity, and our comprehensive hedging
strategy has reduced interest rate risk. Credit quality remains strong with 2019 net charge-offs at the low end of
our average through the cycle target range. We remain prudent with our allocation of capital to ensure we are
earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk profile.
2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend. Coupling the dividend with $441 million of
share repurchases during the year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in 2019 which represented a
total payout ratio of 79%.
As we previously communicated on many instances, our capital priorities are: first, to fund organic growth;
second, to support the cash dividend; and finally, all other capital uses including the buyback and selective
acquisitions. These capital priorities have not changed.
Now moving to the economy, we continue to see growth and our expectation for 2020 is for continued expansion.
Consumers continue to perform well across our footprint with strong labor markets driving wage inflation. In the 12
months ending November 2019, unemployment rates declined or remained the same in 17 of the 20 largest
MSAs in Huntington's footprint states.
Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in the Midwest. Home prices continue to appreciate with
especially solid increases in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.
Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. The
positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer lending businesses.
Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full year 2019 and the 2019 fourth
quarter. Our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter and we expect another
good year in 2020 for our consumer lending businesses, again, driven primarily by residential mortgage and auto
finance.
Now we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the measured tone from some of our
commercial customers, economic uncertainty along with tight labor markets remain headwinds for more robust
economic growth in our footprint.
Overall, Huntington is performing well with disciplined organic growth. Our customers are generally confident
about their performance for 2020, and we share that confidence in our performance. We continue to see good
traction in our new specialty lending verticals with mid-corporate lending, technology, media and telecom, our
practice finance area, which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Looking out to 2020, we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth, reduce our
future expense growth and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses and technology. We
repositioned $2 billion of securities, picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities. The
rebalance resulted in $22 million of security losses in the fourth quarter.
On the expense side, we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation of 30
in-store branches. Now these actions, along with the disposition of other properties and the technology system
decommission, resulted in unusual expense of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Our disciplined expense
management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology and enterprise growth initiatives going
forward.
I'm confident in our positioning entering 2020, and our colleagues are focused in executing our plans. We are all
aligned with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-
cycle shareholder returns.
Zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Zach?

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call with
Huntington. Slides 4 and 5 provide highlights of our full-year 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 results, respectively,
many of which Steve already touched on. Fourth quarter results include approximately $47 million of pre-tax
impact or approximately $0.03 per share after tax from previously announced actions that were taken to better
position the bank for 2020 including the securities repositioning, workforce actions and the pending in-store
branch closures.
Let's turn to slide 6 to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind the financial performance for the quarter.
Average earning assets increased $2.3 billion or 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Average loans and leases
increased $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year with balanced consumer and commercial loan growth.
Average commercial and industrial loans increased 3% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest
component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well-diversified over the past year with
notable growth in specialty banking, asset finance, and corporate banking.
Our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations as a portion of deals we expected to close
at the end of the year were pushed into 2020 and seasonal declines in line utilization at year-end were larger than
normal. Overall, commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty.
We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels, with average CRE
loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease, driven by pay-downs and refinancing activity. Consumer loan
growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust originations in the second half of
2019.
Average residential mortgage loans increased 7% year-over-year. As we typically do, we sold the agency
qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Now, turning to slide 7, average total deposits decreased less than 1% year-over-year, while average core
deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by the June
2019 sale of the Wisconsin retail branch network, including approximately $725 million or almost 1% of core
deposits.
We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts, reflecting
shifting customer preferences, and we are focused â€“ and where we are focused on promotional pricing. Average
money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while savings decreased 9% and core CDs decreased
16%. We expect this dynamic to continue in 2020.
Average noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing DDA accounts each increased 1% year-over-year. As shown on
slide 32 in the appendix, we're very pleased that our commercial noninterest-bearing deposits increased 5% year-
over-year in the quarter. This growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low cost deposit base through
new customer acquisition and relationship deepening.
Moving now to slide 8, FTE net interest income decreased $55 million, or 7%, versus the year-ago quarter,
primarily driven by the 29 basis point decline in net interest margin, partially offset by 2% increase in average
earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.12% for the quarter, down 29 basis points from the year-ago quarter,
down 8 basis points linked quarter, and in line with the guidance we provided at the Goldman Sachs conference
in December.
Moving to slide 9, our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.08%, down 26 basis points from the
year-ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 4 basis points to the net interest margin in the
current quarter compared to 7 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Slide 28 in the appendix provides information
regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020. Please note that
this quarter is the last quarter we intend to provide core NIM and PAA breakouts as the PAA is expected to have
a relatively immaterial impact in 2020.
Turning to earning asset yields, our commercial loan yields decreased 52 basis points year-over-year, consumer
loan yields decreased 8 basis points, and security yields decreased 16 basis points. The decrease in our earning
asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the three Federal Reserve rate reductions
that occurred during 2019.
On the funding side of the balance sheet, our deposit costs continue to move lower as CDs and money market
promotional rates reprice lower, and we actively managed commercial deposit costs. Total interest-bearing
deposit costs of 87 basis points for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year though down 11 basis points
sequentially.
Slide 10 summarizes the actions we've taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the
lower interest rate environment. Our hedging strategies reduced the downside risk from lower interest rates and
have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest income. Our current interest rate risk
modeling suggests little change to net interest income from either a 25 basis point increase or 25 basis point
decrease in 2020.
We continuously monitor and we'll continue to prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest
rate environment, balance sheet mix, and other factors necessitate. The graphs on the bottom left of the slide
detail the mix of our loan portfolio, as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with repricing events in
the first half of 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
These repricing events provide an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits as these higher priced
CDs and promotional money market accounts reprice lower. Through December, the consumer deposit repricing
activity is on track with our expectations. The success of our consumer deposit repricing and retention has
provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in our commercial deposit pricing, particularly among the
highest cost deposits.
The graph on the bottom right of the slide displays the impact of our actions. You can see the downward trajectory
of our total interest-bearing deposit costs by month since July. We expect this trend to continue given the
significant deposit repricing opportunities that remain in the first half of 2020.
Turning to slide 11, you can see it provides the detail on our noninterest income which increased 13% from the
year ago quarter. The growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income which increased 152% primarily
reflecting higher saleable origination volume and secondary market spreads, as well as a $12 million increase in
the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management.
We also continued to see steady growth in card and payment processing income, trust and investment
management, and insurance. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we repositioned $2 billion of securities, picking up
approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities prospectively, at a cost of $22 million in Q4.
While negatively impacting fourth quarter results, the prospective earnings pickup and the earn-back on the
repositioning losses are very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio. The
year-ago quarter in 2018 included $19 million of securities losses from similar repositioning.
Slide 12 provides the components of the 1% year-over-year decrease in noninterest expense. The 2019 fourth
quarter included $25 million of expense related to the actions which Steve discussed earlier, while the year-ago
quarter included $35 million of similar branch and facility consolidation related expense. Adjusting for these items,
noninterest expenses were essentially flat.
We continue to drive efficiency in our core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel
our investments in digital, mobile, and cyber technology, enhanced products and services, and distribution
capabilities. This disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on an
adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year.
Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended
the quarter at 7.88%, up 67 basis points from a year ago, and Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, ended the
quarter at 9.88% or 23 basis points year-over-year. We continue to manage CET1 to the high end of our 9% to
10% operating guidelines.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 13.1 million common shares at an average cost of $14.96 per
share or a total of $196 million. We plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital following the CECL
implementation back to a CET1 level near 10% by the end of 2020, excluding the benefit of the CECL transition
provision provided by the Federal Reserve.
We feel managing internally to a CET1 level excluding the three-year transition, reinforces our commitment to
maintaining strong capital ratios, which we see as a position of strength for the organization. As a result, we are
currently planning to repurchase less than a third of the remaining $249 million of share repurchase capacity on
our 2019 capital plan in the first half of 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Now, let me turn it over to Rich to cover credit including CECL. Go ahead, Rich?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Zach. Slide 14 provides an update on our CECL adoption. We estimate our allowance for credit losses,
or ACL, will increase 44% from the year end 2019 ACL to $1.28 billion, or 1.70% of total loans and leases on an
adjusted basis. As we stated on the third quarter call, given our 50% mix of relatively longer dated consumer
loans, the CECL lifetime loss methodology results in a higher allowance than the prior methodology. The increase
in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio.
As we move forward under CECL, it is a new accounting standard with many variables. Our day two allowance for
credit losses will be determined using various models that incorporate multiple scenarios, historical loss and
recovery rates, borrower characteristics, and other factors. As a result, we expect more volatility in our quarterly
provisioning expense. Our parallel testing, however, indicates that key factors being held constant the aggregate
annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change from the current incurred loss methodology
despite that higher quarterly variability.
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Despite challenges in our oil and gas
portfolio, our credit metrics remain strong. As we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected
given the absolute low level of problem loans. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core
principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our
aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
Net charge-offs remain near the low end of our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points.
Net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, flat
to the prior quarter and up from 27 basis points in the year-ago quarter. The increase was centered on the oil and
gas portfolio which made up approximately half of the total commercial net charge-offs. This portfolio was
primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity prices and limited capital markets activity.
We have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio representing less than 2% of total loans, and we believe we have it
appropriately reserved for.
Consumer charge-offs have remained fairly consistent over the past year. There is additional granularity on
charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides. Annual net charge-offs, excluding the $67 million of
oil and gas related losses, were 26 basis points and just 15 basis points for the commercial portfolio. The non-
performing asset ratio increased 2 basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 0.66%, again,
primarily as a result of the stress in our oil and gas book.
The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remain relatively stable at 1.04%, down 1 basis
point versus the linked quarter.
Let me turn it back over to Zach.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Rich. Slide 16 illustrates our expectations for full-year 2020. We expect 2020 to be another year of
sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies. We expect full-year

Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
average loan growth in the range of 3% to 4% with continued growth in both consumer and commercial portfolios.
We expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side, focused in home lending and auto finance. We
expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data.
Full-year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% to 4% as we remain focused on acquiring
forward checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. Specifically, our expectation entails continued
decline in CDs more than offset by growth in checking and money market.
We expect full-year total revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a GAAP basis with growth in both net interest
income and non-interest income. We are projecting the NIM to rebound in the first half of 2020 from the 2019
fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second half of the year.
Given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning, we remain confident in our outlook for net interest
income growth. While deposit pricing remains rationale in our markets, we are closely watching the competitive
environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and opportunity for variance
to our NIM forecast. We expect non-interest income on a GAAP basis to grow at a slightly higher pace than total
revenue in 2020, driven by the continued focus on deepening customer relationships.
Full-year non-interest expense is expected to increase 1% to 3%. Based on our active management in 2019, we
are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory. Our focus is on driving continued
investment in opportunities to further differentiate Huntington and drive revenue growth.
As we've told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions and our 2020 guidance, we remain
committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage. We anticipate that the full-year 2020 net charge-offs
will be within a range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points.
As Rich just covered, fundamentally, our credit remains strong. We're taking decisive action to mitigate the risk in
our oil and gas portfolio. As a result, we have expectations for oil and gas charge-offs remaining slightly elevated
in the first half of 2020. These charges are fully represented in our 2020 guidance. We believe we are adequately
reserved at year-end and with the life-of-loan CECL adoption. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the
remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning. Lots to ask about but I'll just maybe start, Steve, with just â€“ you talked a little bit about headwinds
in commercial, but we do have USMCA and Phase 1, China seemingly done. Just curious if you could give us a
little bit more color on that and if you're seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Jon, USMCA has just recently done and obviously there are other issues and distractions going on in DC. right
now. So I don't think there's a meaningful change yet. But from what we reported at the prior conference, and I do
expect there's going to be a second half â€“ I'm optimistic in that regard. But I think it's going to be a little hesitant,
little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year.
We did see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year. So spot balances were down a bit from where
we expected them to be. That was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash on sheet. So I think that
just reflects this conservatism and just sort of a wait and see approach. Again in the Midwest, we're hampered by
lack of labor. So that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more, Zach or Rich. Maybe, Rich, for you, just â€“ can you talk about the
day two CECL impact again? I think what you said is you expect the provision to be roughly the same in 2020
compared to 2019. I wonder if I heard that right and, Zach, how you want us to think about provisioning in 2020.
Thanks.

Yeah. This is Rich. The testing that we've done and again this is new, so we're kind of going through quarter-by-
quarter. The testing that we did, CECL to BAU, showed that there were some quarterly volatility. But over the
course of the year, it tended to level itself out. So, we don't see a lot of volatility â€“ we see more volatility on a
quarterly basis going forward, but we don't expect a material change in the overall provision under CECL than we
had under the incurred loss methodology.

With your revenue outlook for the year, what is the rate backdrop that you are assuming right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Zach. I'll take that question, David. Good talk with you. We're essentially assuming the forward yield curve
as it existed in November although it's relatively consistent with where it looks right now. The Fed funds
expectation is relatively neutral. I think that the actual forward rate look at it precisely, included forecasted one
rate cut sort of in the late summertime period. But I think, as we noted in the prepared remarks, based on our
hedging program, our net interest income and NIM is essentially neutralized from one rate increase or one rate
decrease from today. So I would say, sort of taking a step back, sort of roughly flat from where we are today.

Got it. And if the rate backdrop goes against you, do you have additional levers that you can pull on the expense
side so you can still produce positive operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes, we do. I think under most realistic rate scenarios, as I mentioned, the hedging program will keep our NIM
pretty constant. So we're not expecting to pull those expense levers. But as always, we do have a number of
expense levers that we've got at our disposal. I'll take down a few of them. We can always look at the pacing and
phasing of our strategic growth initiatives. We've got the number one branch share in Michigan and Ohio. And so,
looking at our branch network and the cost around that is an opportunity. And I think generally, as we see revenue
soften, we typically see the linked variable expense reduction from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that.
So those are the levers we've got [ph] as well (00:28:09) we look at all the time. There are other levers like
staffing contingency plans which you saw us pull in the fourth quarter of 2019 which are at our disposal. But
again, it's not our expectation that we'll have to do that in 2020. The last thing I would just say is, you commented
positive operating leverage. We are managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in 2020.

Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yes. This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. I just have a two-part question on your auto lending business.
Considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in this space, are you
seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you have previously expected?
And then the second part is tied to CECL. The CECL implementation impact, your appetite for auto loans going
forward, just trying to gauge what's your 2020 auto loan growth outlook following a flattish average balance in
2019?

Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. John (sic) [Rahul]. It's rich. I'll take that. So I'll take the second question first. So, as it relates to CECL, the
auto business is really neutral. The weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that much different than
what we had under the incurred loss methodology. So it's a fairly benign impact from a CECL standpoint. As it
11

relates to the overall business strategy, I think we have just a tremendous franchise across multiple states with
thousands of dealers that we've got the ability to drive volume. I think we are in a very high FICO band that tends
to be more price sensitive than others. So I don't see us having any real issues in meeting the origination goals
that we've got from the indirect auto business in 2020.

Rahul Patil Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. And then, last quarter, I believe, you'd indicated that the consensus NIM estimate around that time of
3.20% for full year 2020 was reasonable. But I believe that you had assumed earlier a couple of rate cuts in that
2020 NIM guidance. Could you just discuss your updated thoughts? I know you talked about rebound in first half
and then stable. But are you still comfortable with that 3.20% level right now?

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Zach, I'll answer that one. So the answer is, yes, we are still comfortable
with the approximately 3.20% guidance that we talked about in December at the Goldman Sachs Conference and
then just reiterated today in the prepared remarks. We expect the trajectory of that to be ticking higher than the
first quarter, sort of stabilizing around that level by mid second quarter and then oscillating around that level
through the balance of the year.
There's really a couple big drivers of that. So the most substantial of which is the repricing of the deposit
maturities that we talked about in the prepared remarks. There's roughly $5 billion repricing in Q1 and another $4
billion repricing in Q2. And so far, we're really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that which is
proceeding according to our plans. The other factor, which a little smaller but still helpful is the 70 basis points of
pickup we got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier. So those two factors are what's driving
that and helping us to get the NIM back to 3.20%.
With that being said, there's a couple of factors we're watching, asset yields on new production, [ph] although
(00:31:53) your previous question around auto and residential, we continue to see them where we want them, but
that's something we look at very carefully.
The other one is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the volume and rate for the deposit costs. Again, we're
seeing the trend on our expectation but it's something that we'll continue to watch. Those are the biggest factors
that could cause the NIM to be higher or lower than that 3.20%.

Okay. And then I just want to clarify one thing and that is assuming a rate cut in December of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. Assuming â€“ essentially the forward rate curve that exists in November as I mentioned which if you look
precisely at the Fed funds expectation in that, had one cut over the late summer time period. But even if it's flat,
we're going to be roughly [indiscernible] (00:32:39).

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. One more question on the...

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...good morning. One more question on the deposit side of things, to see what you're expecting for total growth.
I'm assuming that's still coming from core customer growth. You mentioned the $5 billion that's going to reprice.
Underneath that, can you just talk about what's happening in your markets as far as just underlying core deposit
pricing and if that's still also coming down aside from what you're just scheduled is going to reprice from the
rollovers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I mean I think we're â€“ as I said, we're seeing the repricing activity be pretty much in line with our
expectations, ticking down, but also being somewhat competitive. So we assumed and planned for the rate
environment we've got right now, and we're seeing it trend in that way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Muth A
Director-Investor Relations, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Ken, this is Mark. I would say that generally what we're seeing on the consumer side is very rational and as
we would have expected, and the repricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention has allowed us
to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side, which we do see as more competitive.
If you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there, it definitely is on the commercial side and
particularly, with your large dollar deposits on the commercial side. And we've just allowed some of those to leave
the bank as a result of the success we're having on consumer side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And then one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet. With pretty good loan growth and
pretty good deposit growth, what do you see happening in terms of both the size, securities portfolio, and can you
talk about the underlying dynamics of â€“ in a stable rates environment, your front book, back book?
