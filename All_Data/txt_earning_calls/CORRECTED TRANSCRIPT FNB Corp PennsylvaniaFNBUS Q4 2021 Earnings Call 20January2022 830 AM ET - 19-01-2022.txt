Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vincent Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer.
FNB's fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.30, bringing our full year earnings to $1.23, the highest earnings
per share due to the restructuring of the company in 2004. In addition to the solid EPS number, the fourth quarter
was highlighted by robust loan growth, as well as the launch of the mobile eStore and the digital rollout of our
enhanced Physicians First program. This full service offering is dedicated to the personal and commercial needs
of physicians, dentists and veterinarian.
Let's walk through each of these accomplishments, starting with loan growth. Spot loan growth, excluding the
impact of PPP forgiveness increased $610 million, or 10% annualized, from the third quarter 2021. The strong
loan growth supported our 13% annualized sequential growth in net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase
accounting accretion, and provide significant momentum to the 2022 earnings. In addition to achieving our initial
full-year loan growth guidance given last January, we've achieved three consecutive quarters of strong loan
growth, which led to a year-over-year increase of $1.3 billion, or 6%, excluding PPP, from the December 31, 2020
balance.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Commercial quarterly loan growth of 10.6% annualized was due to strong production across our footprint,
demonstrating the benefit of our geographic diversification strategy. This organic loan growth drove total assets to
$40 billion at yearend with pro forma balance sheet of approximately $42 billion once the Howard Bank
acquisition closes in a couple of days.
At the beginning of November, we integrated our eStore shopping tool into the FNB mobile app as part of a series
of innovative enhancements that build on our customers' ability to bank digitally. FNB also successfully upgraded
our mobile banking experience, adding new features and expanding our suite of online loan applications,
including FNB credit cards, mortgage products, home equity lines of credit, home equity installment loans and
small business loans. This platform creates a fully digital bank where customers can conduct routine transactions,
purchase products and services, and schedule time with our bankers virtually.
Our comprehensive mobile offering was recently recognized by S&P Global Market Intelligence, which called FNB
Direct one of the most competitive mobile banking apps in the industry. And their analysis indicates that our
mobile app has more features than any of our peers and is commensurate with J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.
In addition, we were also recognized for our best-in-class digital strategy, Clicks-to-Bricks, and received a
prestigious National Award for our mobile banking experience.
In addition to integrating the eStore, our mobile app was upgraded to incorporate a new modern look, streamline
navigation and direct access, features customers are most likely to use, such as enhanced payment capability,
shopping and account opening tools and mobile chat. This upgrade was received well by our customers as
evidenced by an industry leading app store rating of 4.8 stars. We continue to integrate additional products and
services into our digital platform to better serve our customers and increase our market share through customer
acquisition in a scalable and efficient manner.
Few weeks ago, we rolled out a fully digital and enhanced version of Physicians First program on our eStore. This
holistic suite of digitally accessible products and services dedicated to meeting the unique needs of physicians,
dentists, veterinarians and other healthcare professional includes commercial loans, deposit products, consumer
loans and wealth management services.
With over 250,000 physicians, dentists and veterinarians in our footprint and over $4 billion of new medical
student debt created each year, our opportunity to improve financial outcomes for members of the healthcare
industry is tremendous. We have grown our physician loans 68% in the last 12 months, as we invested in
personnel and products. Given the momentum with our current program, combined with the investment in our
digital capabilities, there is a significant opportunity to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers
within the healthcare industry.
Lastly, I wanted to touch on the Howard Bank acquisition. We're in the final days before our close on January 22
and the systems integration on February 5. We have worked closely with Howard team and expect the transition
to be smooth. We are very impressed with Howard's talented employees and are retaining more front-line
employees than originally expected. In fact, our overall retention across our footprint has been strong, and we are
excited for them to join FNB in this dynamic market.
The acquisition is progressing well as we are on track to achieve the expense saves laid out in the July
announcement. Asset quality has improved more than we originally expected, and similar to past acquisitions,
we'll introduce our expanded product suite to our new clients to drive additional non-interest income growth in
Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Both the one-time costs and the credit mark, including Day 2, are expected to
come in better than originally planned.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary to comment on our overall credit quality. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
We ended the year with continued positive performance across all of our portfolios as we closed out another
successful year and entered 2022 in a position of strength. During the quarter, we saw further improvement in
credit quality as delinquency and NPLs declined, as did our level of rated credit. Additionally, our fourth quarter
and full-year net charge-offs have both reached historically low levels. Let's now review some of the highlights
followed by a brief update on the upcoming Howard Bank acquisition and some closing remarks on our outlook for
2022.
The level of delinquency, excluding PPP balances, ended December at a very solid 62 basis points, an
improvement of 9 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. NPLs and OREO also improved during the period to end
December at 39 basis points, representing a 10-basis-point reduction from the prior quarter with reduced non-
accrual levels of $22 million driving the improvement.
On a year-over-year basis, our non-accruals are down nearly 50% compared to December 2020, representing an
$82 million reduction. This largely reflects the actions we took late in 2020 to better position our loan portfolio for
the year ahead, at which time, we proactively took risk off the table during a challenging macroeconomic
environment.
Net charge offs for the quarter were very low at $1.4 million, or 2 basis points annualized, while full-year net
charge offs for 2021 totaled $14 million and stood at a solid 6 basis points, a historically low level. We recognized
a $2.3 million net benefit in the provision during the quarter following the continued improvement in our credit
quality position and the prior actions taken in 2020 to position the portfolio, as well as a general improvement in
economic factors that favorably impacted our forecast models. This resulted in a GAAP reserve position that was
down 3 basis points to stand at 1.38%, with the ex-PPP reserve decreasing 5 bps to stand at 1.4%, which
remains directionally consistent with our credit reserves.
Our NPL coverage position further improved ending December at a very solid level of 392% following the noted
reductions in NPLs and rated credits during the quarter. Our total ending reserve position inclusive of acquired
unamortized discounts stands at 1.5%.
I'd now like to share with you some brief updates around the upcoming Howard acquisition. Our credit teams have
been carefully tracking and monitoring the Howard portfolio since announcement as is our standard practice. At
this point, we remain pleased with the credit performance and the anticipated Day 1 positioning of this book,
which is tracking better than originally expected. Post-close, we do not expect our loan risk profile or credit quality
performance to be impacted as the Howard book remains well-diversified and will have minimal impacts to our
concentrations of credit.
As we close out another successful year marked by continued positive credit trends, we are very pleased with the
position of our portfolio moving into 2022. With the global challenges and uncertain economic conditions faced
during 2020, our proactive approach to risk management and ongoing review of our credit portfolio allowed us to
strategically position ourselves entering 2021, a proof point of the attentive and disciplined approach we take in
managing our credit book. We remain vigilant and attentive to any emerging risks in both the broader economy

and within the markets in which we and our customers operate. As macro factors continue to change, including
economic conditions, inflationary pressures and the evolving nature of the virus, we will continue to manage our
book through this highly competitive environment with our core credit philosophies front and center. This
foundation of sound and consistent underwriting, attentive management of risk and careful selection of high-
quality lending opportunities continues to support our growth objectives as we look forward to more business
opportunities ahead in 2022.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary.
As we look at our financial results, we have delivered an exceptional performance this past year and exceeded
our full-year expectations on both the bottom line and pre-provision net revenue basis. We produce mid-single-
digit loan growth, excluding PPP, was 5.7% year-over-year growth on a spot basis. We surpassed our full-year
revenue expectations with a record $1.23 billion, driven by continued strategic focus on diversified fee income
contribution. Operating expenses were well-controlled and operating, pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, ended
the year at $508 million. Because of our strong credit quality trends and improved economic conditions, our
provision for loan losses was essentially zero at $0.6 million for the full year. Through the successful execution of
our strategies, we were able to increase our operating net income available to common stockholders by 27% to
$400 million or $1.24 per share.
Let's walk through the fourth quarter financials, starting with the highlights on slide 5. Fourth quarter operating
EPS totaled $0.30, an increase of $0.02 from the year ago quarter. Tangible book value per share increased 9%
year-over-year to $8.59. And excluding PPP, which is more reflective of underlying loan growth, period end total
loans increased $610 million, or 10.1% annualized on a linked-quarter basis, including growth of $421 million in
commercial loans and $188 million in consumer loans. Commercial loan production was a record $1.5 billion
diversified across our geographic footprint. Line of credit utilization increased for the third consecutive quarter to
35.8%, still below the pre-pandemic level of 40% to 45%. Consumer lending has the second highest production
quarter. We also had record linked-quarter growth for small business loans.
Let's continue with the balance sheet on slide 7. Average earning assets are now over $35 billion and securities
increased 4.8% linked-quarter due to pre-investing for the upcoming Howard acquisition and utilizing excess cash
and spot cash balances down 15%. Reported average loans and leases remained flat at $24.7 billion, with loan
growth offset by $620 million reduction in average PPP balances. Average deposits totaled $31.7 billion, an
increase of 2.7% linked-quarter with year-over-year growth in all eight of our primary MSA markets. The growth
continues to lead to a favorable funding mix, given customers' preferences for low cost savings accounts, and
maintain higher checking account balances. We expect organic growth to continue, and as rates raise, expect a
balanced growth in lower beta deposit products to shift to higher beta products.
Turning to slide 8, net interest income totaled $223.3 million, a decrease of $9.1 million, or 3.9% in the prior
quarter total of $232.4 million, reflecting a $15.4 million decreased contribution from PPP given forgiveness
activity, which was partially offset by an increase in average earning assets, a more favorable funding mix and
lower deposit costs. Reported net interest margin decreased 17 basis points to 55 basis points. The total yield on
earning assets declined 19 basis points to 280 basis points, reflecting the reduced PPP contributions and a $498
million or 15.6% increase in average cash balances. Total impact of PPP, purchase accounting accretion and
higher cash balances on net interest margin was a decrease of 14 basis points for the fourth quarter compared to

a benefit of 2 basis points in the prior quarter. But excluding these factors, net interest margin remains stable,
reflecting a 3 basis point reduction in the cost of funds, offsetting the lower yield on variable rate loans.
Now, let's look at non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income totaled $79 million. While this total
decreased $9.9 million, or 11.1% in the record level last quarter, we continue to achieve broad contributions from
our fee-based businesses. Capital markets income totaled $9.5 million, solid contribution from swap activity, loan
syndications, debt capital markets and international banking. We were very impressed with the performance of
our capital markets team with international banking and loan syndications increasing 117% and 42%,
respectively. The recent expansion of our debt capital markets capabilities has tripled revenue in the fourth
quarter, quickly becoming another $1-million-plus revenue business for us.
Service charges increased $0.7 million, reflecting seasonally higher customer activity. Mortgage banking
operations income decreased $2.3 million, or 27.8%, due to a seasonal reduction in held-for-sale pipeline and
lower secondary market revenue. SBA volumes and average transaction sizes continued to be strong, with $2.1
million in premium income included in other non-interest income, the third consecutive quarter exceeding $2
million.
Reported non-interest expense was well-managed and declined $2.6 million or 1.4% linked-quarter to $181.6
million. This reduction was driven by salaries and employee benefits declining $0.8 million, or 0.8%, primarily
related to higher production performance-related commissions and incentives in the prior quarter. Bank shares
and franchise taxes decreased $1.9 million, or 52.8%, due to recognition of state tax credits in the fourth quarter
of 2021. Efficiency ratio equals 58.1% compared to 55.4%, reflecting lower PPP income, and the previously
mentioned non-interest income decreased from record levels last quarter. Overall, this was a strong quarter close
out to 2021, positioning us very well for 2022.
Now, let's turn to 2022 guidance on Page 12. We expect the momentum in 2021 loan growth to continue. We
expect loans to increase in the low-double digits to low-teens, including the benefit of the Howard Bank
acquisition, with underlying organic growth in the mid to high-single digits on a year-over-year spot basis.
Deposits this year have benefited from the PPP program and other government stimulus, which we expect will
begin to run off in 2022. With that runoff included in our assumptions, deposits are projected to grow mid to high-
single digits on a spot basis inclusive of Howard.
Let's now look at the income statement, which includes Howard Bank and all assumptions. We expect net interest
income to end the year between $965 million and $1.005 billion with the first quarter between $226 million to $230
million. Our base guidance currently assumes two rate hikes with the first being in June and the other in
September, although we have one sensitivity analysis given the recent volatility in the interest rate futures. Full-
year non-interest income is expected to be between $320 and $340 million with the first quarter in the high 70s to
$80 million range.
We expect non-interest expense on an operating basis to be between $760 million to $780 million for the full year
and $190 million to $195 million for the first quarter, given normal seasonality and the addition of Howard. These
do not include the one-time expenses associated with the Howard Bank acquisition were expected to be better
than originally modeled. Positive credit quality is expected to continue throughout 2022 with provision guidance of
$20 million to $40 million. This does not include the Day 2 CECL provision for Howard in low $20 million in the
first quarter and is dependent on the net loan growth experienced throughout the year. Lastly, the effective tax
rate should be between 17.5% to 18.5% for the full year.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. 2021 has been a great year for FNB with many accomplishments to celebrate. I'd like to
summarize several significant achievements.
FNB achieved record revenue leading to strong earnings with EPS at the highest level since the company's
restructuring in 2004. We grew loans excluding PPP by $1.3 billion year-over-year to drive total assets to an all-
time high of $40 billion, generated record fee income of over $330 million or 12% year-over-year growth, which
now comprises 27% of total revenue. Our team achieved more than $20 million in run rate cost savings
accomplishing our three-year total cost savings goal of $60 million.
Strength in credit quality, liquidity and the capital position, putting our company in a strong position to execute our
2022 operating, enhanced our digital technologies to better serve our customers, putting us at the top of the
industry and supported our communities during the pandemic through the facilitation of $3.6 billion of PPP loan.
We also continued our effort to provide loans and investments to low and moderate income communities and
received an outstanding CRA rating.
Through our exceptional financial performance, we were able to create value for our shareholders with a 9% year-
over-year increase to tangible book value and a 58% operating return on tangible common equity. In addition, our
company returned approximately $200 million in capital through dividend and the share repurchase program. All
of this would not be possible without the dedication of our FNB employees, who focus on serving their clients and
driving shareholder value every day. This past year was a difficult environment to navigate, but our employees
continuously deliver an exceptional performance.
As we look to 2022, we are well positioned given our continued loan growth momentum, investments in
differentiated technology, asset sensitive balance sheet, solid asset quality and improving capital flexibility. I look
forward to working alongside our employees in 2022, driving performance and superior return.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Very good. Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator

Hey, good morning.

Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hi, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
I actually wanted to start with more of a strategic question for Vince. With the rollout of the digital banking both
app and online marketplace, what will that shift for you all strategically? Are you going to spend more marketing
dollars and try to grab market share there? Or should we just see more efficient operations in the retail bank?
How do you kind of think about that maybe both strategically and financially moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think it adds. It really adds an element to both. I think we're able to operate more efficiently as we stand up
the digital work streams within the company, because that's part of it as well. I mean, the external, the customer-
facing piece of it is important because I think it really helps us scale significantly in markets that have potential
where we may not have top market share or deep penetration. So, having the digital channels we're – I think
since we launched our eStore or we basically reformatted it and re-launched it and then added loan products, we
started last year and then we phased in various loan products. So consumer loans came online in August and
September, and credit card rolled out in January, but mortgages were rolled out in – the mortgage product itself
was rolled out in May. We've done pretty well with applications.
I mean, during that period, we were able to originate almost 3,000 applications online for those loan products. We
haven't even started. We've done no digital advertising. We've done very little with media content or commercials,
but that's going to gear up. So, our plan was to build the interface, to continuously work to improve it, because the
next phase of this is to create an omni-channel application. I've been talking about it for a long time where

customers can go in and fill out one application for five or six products simultaneously. That's coming – by the end
of this year, we should have that pretty much in place. We've been working on the development of it for some
time.
In the meantime, we started standing up the various loan products. We had a full suite of depository products that
we offered. And by the way, deposits we've been doing for a long time, I mean, a couple of years, we took 20,000
applications in the deposit space last year. If you look at what's happened – if you look at what's going on across
the – actually, I have to restate that. We had 20,000 hits on our website and they weren't necessarily applications,
but people who started to engage with the solution center. Once we mobile optimized that particular eStore
product or platform, we should call it, that jumped 56%. So, in December, for the full month of December, we had
31,400 interactions with the eStore. Not all of them led to applications, but they started the process to review the
content on products and services.
What we're doing is we're grabbing that data, those interactions, and where we can identify a customer or where
they've identified themselves, we can create a lead and then push that back through our retail delivery channel
and the commercial bank and have them follow up with it. So, that's kind of the strategy, but it's really started to
take off, and I think it's going to add to our ability to grow loans. I think it has added. I think it's helped us this year
in certain categories, particularly mortgage with 60-plus percent of the applications in a year coming through that
channel.
So, anyway, that's what we're excited about, and I think it will provide us with a great opportunity to eke out
efficiency as we streamline the process to bring these customers on board and work out the digital work streams
within the company, eliminating a lot of manual processes. And then on the flip side, it will help us scale. And we
have not advertised or spent a lot of money promoting it. We will this year. We have a plan to do that. And it's
included in the expense guide that you got from Vince, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Another element too is the non-banking business is running their operations through the digital bank too, wealth,
insurance, private banking. So there's opportunities there to leverage the investments that we've made for really
across the businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you and appreciate you tying it back into the financial guide. Maybe as a follow-up on the financial
guidance for 2022, for Vince Calabrese, just as we think about kind of rate hikes, you've got two built in to the
estimate for the year. But, if we were to get a third, have you kind of looked at the sensitivity on either dollars or
NIM basis to what an incremental rate hike would be in addition to what you have baked in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes. Yeah, we did. With things moving so quickly, we've done some sensitivity analysis around different options.
So, we did quantify that. Basically, the ranges that we have for 2022 would go up by about 3% if we get a rate
hike in March. So adding one March to the June and September that we already have in the guidance is a 3% lift
to the range of $965 million and $1.005 billion.

Okay, great. Really helpful. And one last one, if I could sneak it in, just on Howard, you guys are so close to
closing it. Are there any kind of pro forma balance sheet actions that you expect to take or things that have
already been done whether that would be shrinking it and increasing kind of the NIM benefit or anything like that
that we should be incorporating as we model that?

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think as we sit here today, Michael, the main item would be their borrowings of about $200 million and about
$100 million or so of wholesale deposits that we would – borrowings we would pay off and then the wholesale
deposits kind of wean down over the course of the year. And then, overall, that's the main first step and there's
nothing else from a like an exit portfolio on the loan side that we have in the past some transactions. We've been
very happy with credit quality there. So, it's really those, just those two items as we sit here today.

Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. I wanted to start actually there, I guess, with a follow-up on the rate hike question. I don't believe
you guys provide – [ph] quantify the deposit betas (00:33:25) you use, but just wondered if you could give any
color on how you modeled it out in terms of the first few I would expect very minimal change in deposits pricing
and then maybe pickup after there? But do you guys straight lined it, can you say or do you take that approach?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, it's more of a dynamic modeling process, I would say. I think our expectation as we sit here today would be
kind of get a couple of the Fed moves in and then start to see some impact on the deposit rates. And I guess the
way to characterize it, I would say, by the end of the year, maybe 20% or so of the Fed move would be captured

in the deposit rates. And then, over time, move more towards a kind of historical 40% to 50%, but for 2022 kind of
more in that kind of 20% level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q

Got you. Okay. And that's what you model in terms of the guidance you've given?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then just on the expenses for next year, just wondering if you can speak to how significant inflation plays into
that. And then, I may have missed it, apologies if I did. I know Vince spoke of the $20 million in cost saves you've
done over the last three years. Just wondering if there was something similar for this year and if it's baked [ph]
into that (00:34:44).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say a couple of comments there. I mean, the expenses for Q4, as you know, came in consistent
with our expectations at $180 million was what we guided to. Every line item on the non-interest income side, as
you see, is basically unchanged from the third quarter. As we move forward into 2022, we do have a kind of
inflation component baked into our non-interest expense level for the year. I mean, it's in the single, kind of mid-
single digits, I would say, from a millions of dollars standpoint but that is baked into the guidance that we have.
And then second part, Frank, what was the second part again?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Cost save, the $20 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The cost save number, we had, as you commented, $20 million a year for three years. We've got a lot of
consolidation with the branches over those three years. So, the bogie we have for this year is $10 million in total
for cost save, and that's also baked into the guidance. And I guess importantly, I should say, too, that when you
look at the – from an operating leverage standpoint, PPP, as we know, is kind of rolling through and there's a little
bit of a tail left in the first half of the year. But if you look at the underlying operations of the company and we have
positive operating leverage each quarter and expect that to build and – if the rate moves come in, obviously, that
gives that even more of a lift. But as we've guided to here, there's positive operating leverage in each quarter and
building throughout the year. So I just wanted to comment on that, too.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good. So loan growth, again, very impressive, third consecutive quarter. I think the last time we spoke, you guys
are very pleased with how December was going. I guess, given the strong December, given the strong
production, was any of that pulled forward from the first quarter and then I guess as you look out at your 2022
guidance, the mid to high-single digit, could that prove conservative of the current kind of level of momentum
continues or do you see something else occurring in 2022 that may kind of bring that loan growth rate down from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think the guide we gave is fairly consistent if you look back historically in our above trajectory. It's fairly
consistent to where we've grown historically. So, in our assessment of what the potential is in the marketplace,
obviously, we don't know. We rely on pipelines, economic data and this input from the field to determine what we
think we can produce. I would say, historically, we've been in the mid to upper-single-digit range, really skewing
towards the upper-single-digit range.
With everything that's gone on economically with stimulus, still the economy is still feeling the effects of stimulus.
There is potential for us to outperform, but we can't – we have to rely on what we know today. And our pipelines
are good. We don't really comment on the details of the pipeline, but I would say it's pretty good across the board,
particularly in the Southeast and in the mid-Atlantic region. So we have been doing pretty well down there and it's
really paid off for us. That expansion has helped us.
The investment in technology, sure, if that starts to really take off, if the adoption picks up, we could see some
significant growth in certain categories. Consumer loan categories pick up some growth in small business
potentially, so that could be additive. But our guide, I think, that's rooted in historical growth for the company. And
I think it's reasonable to apply that guide.
I also think that you ask about the first quarter. I don't know if you meant the first quarter of this year, when we
were softer and then we had three strong quarters in the second half of the year or do you mean moving into next
year, this quarter 2022?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. I meant that the fourth quarter production, if any of that was pulled forward from the first quarter of 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. No, we can't time – having been a commercial banker, I tell Vince Calabrese this all the time, he's like why
can't these people forecast when they're going to close the deal. We don't control when transactions closed.
There are so many factors. Obviously, the bankers want to get paid and our incentive compensation plans are
geared towards they get paid on what they close each quarter. So there's a kind of a tug of war between the client
and the corporate banker. But at the end of the day, the client wins. And M&A transaction gets delayed. There are
all kinds of things that can happen. They decide to defer CapEx spend into the next year, and there goes your
incentive comp, right? You got it. You get pushed into March. So we don't really control that. I don't think anybody
– there's no reason for people to sandbag in our plans the way they're structured. So, I would suspect that the
flow of production is real and normal and it's not impacted by our people or behaviors of our people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color and thank you for that. And then maybe a question for Gary, looking at the provision
outlook for 2022 relative to your comments on asset quality expectations kind of when the Howard deal was
announced to today, could that prove to be conservative as well as maybe some of that Day 2 allowances is
reversed out throughout the year? I guess just maybe talk through the puts and takes of further reserve releases,
better Howard performance and then providing for incremental growth and how that plays through the provision in
2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I guess the important pieces there, Timur, are the continuance of the solid performance across the book of
business that we manage, and we do expect that to continue to track very nicely. But also the other important
factor is the loan growth that we're able to put up. That loan growth is really going to drive that provision expense
around that guide. So depending upon how strong that growth is from that mid to high-single-digit level, it could
push it up as we move forward. Referencing Howard, we're very pleased with the performance of that portfolio.
And the Day 1 credit mark and the Day 2 provision on that book are going to be better than expected as was
mentioned earlier. So all told, everything's moving in a good direction there. It's going to be driven by those
factors as we work our way through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then one more, if I could. Just looking at the balance sheet, it looks like some of the
repositioning out of cash and into securities occurred in the back end of the quarter and I think, Vince, you
referenced that the margin is a bit spring loaded going into the first quarter of 2022. Maybe just talk through that
dynamic and what was being purchased in the quarter on the securities book and kind of how you expect that to
flow through the margin?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Sure. Yeah. The slide references the average cash balance kind of building from $3.2 to $3.7 during the fourth
quarter. On a spot basis, it actually came down to $0.5 billion, so we ended the year at $3 billion [ph] without that
(00:43:33) excess cash. And as we think about what's taken into our 2022 guidance, that number comes down
about half between now and the end of the year is what we're projecting. As far as the investment portfolio, during
the fourth quarter, we invested a little over $900 million into the portfolio, which is about double the portfolio cash
flows. A good portion of that being pre-investing in anticipation of the Howard s acquisition. So kind of on a net
basis, the portfolio grew $179 million.
During the fourth quarter, we're investing around $134 million. In the third quarter, for reference, it was $113
million. So, with 21 basis points higher than what we're investing in the third quarter, you run that forward to so far
this year in the first quarter in January, we've invested $300 million we put to work so far in January at $154
million, so another 21 basis points higher than where we were in fourth quarter. So – and at a pretty low duration
too, [ph] 33.7 (00:44:35). So as we look to the end of the quarter, there's a lot of moving parts with Howard
coming in. We're looking to end of the quarter with securities at about $7 billion, $7.1 billion at the end of March
from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion as we end the year.

Good morning, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
So, just hopefully to close the loop here on the NII guide. You've talked about the impact of excess cash and
you've talked about the impact of deposit pricing. I just was curious on the timing in terms of any floors or anything
like that in terms of the incremental benefit of additional hikes as we as we work our way through the year and
into next year. How's the balance sheet position for kind of the first hike relative to future hikes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say the floors that we have are really pretty low. We have $12.5 billion of loans that are indexed
towards LIBOR [indiscernible] (00:45:59) less than $400 million, $350 million or so have floors on them with a
current benefit of 63 basis points. So, basically, you'd have to Fed moves before that [ph] 356 moves (00:46:12),

but that's a small portion of the overall portfolio. Just to remind you that as far as the total portfolio, I mean, we
have $9.9 billion in total loans at the end of the year tied to one-month LIBOR and then another $2.5 billion tied to
Prime. So, between the two, it's 50% of the loan portfolio that's tied to those short-term indices. In the floor levels,
we didn't have the benefit it on the way down. So, part of life, it's not that large of a balance there that kind of have
to work back to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then on the non-interest income side, obviously, mortgage banking will be impacted by the refi
cycle coming to an end here, but wondering how you think about the rest of the base of non-interest income and
what impact that could have on any of those line items from a rising rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say, as we've talked about in the past, the investments we've made over the last couple of strategic
planning cycles to invest in these fee-based businesses has paid very well for us, particularly, in an environment
when rates came down. If you look at the different components, I mean, service charges just driven by customer
activity. The wealth management business up 16% year-over-year, Trust and Securities Commission. So, we look
for that to continue to have nice growth this year. The insurance business has been growing nicely. Cap markets,
while it was down from a [ph] lights out (00:47:51) record of 12.5% in the third quarter, $9.5 million is a very solid
number. We will look for that to kind of grow as we go forward.
And then with additive, too, is with Howard coming on board, the depth of the products and services that we have,
we do not have. So we have the opportunity there for their client base to offer a much broader set of products and
services, including capital markets, private banking as well. So, we're very much looking forward to having them
as far as a company and working with those customers. So, it's kind of all baked in. I mean, the interest rate
environment we described were baked into our guidance. So, it's kind of all in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. From a practical perspective, we would expect mortgage banking fee income to be down, right, because
margins have come in versus the peak of that cycle. But offsetting that, on the flip side, in a rising rate
environment, SBA gain on sale becomes better. That business is starting to pick up for us. Our debt capital
markets platform that Vince mentioned that we've launched this past year, it's already in $1 million in revenue; so
that will help moving into next year. And there are some transactions that will be a part of this year. I'd say next
year, but I meant 2022. There are transactions that we're already part of, so we'll get some benefit from the
income perspective there. Syndications, the pipeline is still pretty strong in syndications and that business has
been moved pretty nicely across the footprint, and we're now starting to see larger opportunities in the Southeast,
in mid-Atlantic region, as well as Pittsburgh and Cleveland and our traditional markets.
And then, as we look at other opportunities to grow fee income, particularly in treasury management with the
deployment of products and services and the Howard acquisition, we feel there's enough other businesses in our
diversified model to offset the declines that occur through economic cycle, that's kind of how we designed it and
we're hoping if that holds true for us and we'll achieve the guidance that we're giving here. There's a lot of moving
parts. I'm sorry, Vince, I just wanted to add...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And on the mortgage side, I would just add that, as we look into what's in our guidance for 2022, I would
expect the fourth quarter well around $6 million probably to see kind of a bottom. Part of why I'm saying that is, if
you look at the expectation in the market for mortgage applications, I mean, it's down 25% to 30%. But for us,
75% of our business is purchased and the purchase side is actually the expectations from Fannie Mae at least
were up 8% to 10%. So that kind of bodes well given the business model that we run on the mortgage side and
with us having 75% on the purchase side. So, I would expect that number, all things being equal, to kind of build
from here as we go through 2022 and as that's baked into our guidance, too.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but just two quick ones. One just on
the loan growth, obviously, over the last few quarters, it's easy to see the benefit of having the diversified platform.
But the CRE growth has been a little slower. Sorry if I missed any commentary in this. But I was just curious as
you look at the kind of the diversity of the pipeline heading into next year, any thoughts about where you're
expecting to see that mid to high-single digit core growth come from? Is the mix going to look similar to the back
half of this year? Or do you think there's room for maybe some other buckets to contribute some more based on
the pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think there's been a lot of activity in CRE. I've been involved in discussions with some of the borrowers. So
there are still some projects that we're looking at that are fairly sizable and some projects that we closed that fund
up over the course of the next year or so. So I would expect that business unit to contribute a little more next year.
But I think, overall, when we look at our pipeline, the Carolinas still have very strong pipeline. I think Charleston's
been terrific for us. We had good growth in Raleigh. Charlotte, there's a building pipeline in Charlotte for this year.

And then the mid-Atlantic region with the Howard acquisition, positioning the bank, we'll be number six in deposit
share and have a pretty substantial lending in that market and in Washington D.C.
So I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to achieve these growth objectives. And I said it before, I think it's really
attributable to our expansion strategy and the fact that we were able to secure a substantial market share position
and fairly dynamic MSAs across the Southeast and the mid-Atlantic, it really helps us. So, we're in a good position
as the economy continues – hopefully, the economy continues to hold together and give us some upside in this
year.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Michael. One of the things...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...that impacted Q4 a bit there on the CRE side. We had six multifamily projects as we talked in the past, just
being kind of lumpy. Six projects for a $150 million move into the secondary market. So, that was a bit of a
challenge from a footings standpoint in that particular book of business and we're going to continue to have that
as that's an important part of what we do, especially in the Southeast as Vince mentioned. So, you'll continue to
see some lumpiness there with those exits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Helpful. And then just lastly for me, obviously, it's good to see – there were some regulatory uncertainty
headlines in the markets about deals closing, so it's good to see Howard closing shortly and as expected. Just
curious if you can provide an updated outlook on kind of 2022 and where M&A is from an appetite perspective
and just how you kind of view the market overall, and if you think there'll be more opportunities or if the pipeline
isn't as robust today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, as I've said before, we're really focused on the best deployment of capital possible. So, Howard kind of met
the criteria, was in market, you take cost out, it was a good team. It was a decent size. It wasn't too big. We could
easily digest it. It really gave us the ability to position the company from an expense perspective, moving into an
environment where everyone's concerned about inflation and wage pressures. So, it really worked out well, the
timing of it, plus we're coming off of PPP. So we were able to pick up those balances and the timing also was
good with the launch of our eStore and the upgrades to our digital offerings. So we could offer those consumers
those products.
So I think that's an example of an M&A opportunity that we thought was good, right, when we looked at it. We
were approved by the Fed and the OCC, I think, within 32 days of application, so we did not experience delays.
Maybe the relative size of the transaction plus our outstanding rating and that we had just concluded – our
outstanding CRA rating and that we had just concluded some exams that maybe got the regulators a little more

comfortable. But we were able to do that, and I'm very proud of that. I think our relationship with the regulators is
strong and we listen and we respond. And I think that that's why we were able to get our deal approved.
And we're very conservative in terms of re-underwriting the credits, estimating the provision for the reserves in
those portfolios and there's a great deal of comfort there. Having said that, I keep telling everybody what I'm most
excited about is the investment that we've made in digital and our digital technology. What's going on inside the
company that you can't see from automation and AI perspective, our data analytics team, the data hub that we've
created, the infrastructure we've built out internally has really been helping us not just with securing customers
and gathering information to help our customers with products and services, but also to gain efficiency within the
company to monitor more and more metrics to help us drive performance.
So, all of that's very, very exciting to me. And I think given the positioning of the company – we did our big
expansion and moved into two very dynamic areas of the country, which should provide us with significant
opportunities for years to come. So, our focus is going to be on driving market share gains in those markets. And
if something comes along from an M&A perspective that made sense and fits into that strategy, sure, we're going
to look at it, but it has to be shareholder friendly, it can't be something that harms us as shareholders.

Hey, good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the growth commentary. Curious if you could provide some
additional color on what you think needs to happen to hit the high end of the range, so to take you from the mid to
the high-single-digit. Is that C&I utilization continuing to improve portfolio in single family at the current puts? Just
curious as to what you think the drivers of that delta will be?

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think it'll be a combination. We're going to have to execute in all of those areas. And I think – we grew 10%
with very little help from expansion and working capital facilities. I know I've read other earnings reports and other
companies have seen growth in line utilization. We haven't really. I mean, we were up 1%. It's a de minimis
amount that we contributed. So while that is a factor, I think the more activity you see around working capital
utilization, that means there's opportunities to finance other things too. So that – obviously, those two go hand-in-
hand.

But we have great opportunities in the middle market across the footprint with the rollout of the eStore and now
being able to digitally onboard small business customers, we have a great opportunity there to do it much more
efficiently, cost-effectively across our footprint. So there is upside there. There is upside in consumer. There is
upside in mortgage with our Physicians First program that we rolled out that I mentioned. So, yeah, I think we've
got a lot of channels to drive that growth. So I think...

And then our pipelines looked pretty solid going into the year, so we're feeling pretty good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's great, Vince. Thank you. And then just last one for me is a follow-up on the expense savings you
mentioned, the $10 million. Is that from continued branch rationalization or any other drivers there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Just from all the normal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have an expense team. We call the guy that runs it our real CEO because he is the expense driver. So, he is
the chief expense officer. So we have somebody that reports to Vince. And Adam does a terrific job. We look at
every single line item and then we look at every single large contract that we have. We'd look at a number of
statistics around the branch network and we spend a lot of time. There's a whole team of really data analytics
people that look at transaction counts and the like. And then, we also have an effort within our operations area
under Danny App to review automation and the utilization of intelligent software to help automate and eliminate
redundant process and manual process. So, all of that kind of ties in to the expense reduction and then, we also
have a team that looks at occupancy expense just constantly. I mean, they're constantly reviewing that. We don't
let any FTEs – I mean we review every single adds to staff, every replacement position at the company and we
require people to do an analysis based upon transaction volumes [indiscernible] (01:01:58) ratio to justify even
replacement.
The company has run – we've been very fortunate in that given the turnover at many companies, our vacancy rate
has been within historical norms. So, we've not seen a mass exodus. People leave here and there, but it's been
pretty solid. We've not had any trouble recruiting people. So, I think – those are all the things we do to manage
expenses, so there's a whole process around it, and I think we've been we've done a very good job and Vince and
Adam and that team with Lou, they work for Lou, have done a terrific job keeping us in line.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
How's the best workplace accolades helped you with the team?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean we've won best workplace for a number of years. We just won for the 10th year and one publication
in Pittsburgh and just about every market the last decade, we've won awards. And the award – the employees
feel like they're part of the process and there's a tremendous amount of engagement. We had off the charts
engagement scores when we hired a third party to survey the employee base.
So, I think the culture here is very strong. It's a collaborative culture. People genuinely like each other. It comes
back in the results that we get. Even though some of us are crazy, I think, but the rest of the company is pretty –
they enjoy coming to work and working hard and winning. And I think that when you have a culture like that, sure,
you're not impenetrable, but it's a good place to be. Anyway, that's what leads to our performance and our results;
all of these things come into play. Okay.

Duration, 3%, yes, on the available for sale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And then along the lines of kind of market share gains, do you have any sort of initiative for hiring,
whether team left outs or anything like that if you could just tell us about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, we've hired quite a few people over the last 12 months. We've hired – we generally hire people
from larger institutions in the commercial bank. So, we just hired somebody from J.P. Morgan here in Pittsburgh,
who's leading the teams in Pittsburgh. We've hired a number of bankers from other companies in the Southeast.
So, good bit of our bankers have come from either at one point in their career, they were at either Wells or BofA in
the Southeast, the entire Charleston team, I think.
At different times, we can do a lift out but we've hired a number of people from Wells and BB&T and other places,
and I think that's part of our culture, too. That's why we're able to replace positions. I think people view our
product set as deep. If you're a corporate bankers, the incentive compensation plans are fair and provide upside,
and you've got a good solid set of products from debt capital markets all the way across to most of the
commercial treasury management products, which we've Greenwich Awards in the treasury management space,
national award.
So, coming here as a commercial banker, you've got it made. I mean, you're coming and many of these markets,
we have a high deposit share, but a low relative commercial share. So, the entire market is open to you. So, if
there's anybody out there listening on the call that wants to work here, please call me. But I think of all the places I
have worked, I've never worked for a company where the management of the wholesale bank – I mean, there's
such a collaborative, spirited culture. I can't even describe it. I mean, other large companies, people were fighting
within various product areas. Here, the incentive compensation plans are designed to have people work together
and they do work together to win. They just want to win in the marketplace and do the best they can for their
clients and for our shareholders. So, it's a great culture, and like I said, we've not had an issue bringing people in
from any – from the largest bank in the United States all the way down, so to smaller institutions. So, anyway.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. And then if I could just sneak in a last one. Do you have any sort of overdraft reduction
plans moving forward?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
We actually – we're ahead of the curve there. We rolled out a product last year. There was a press release that
was put out. You can find it. We have a totally – we have an electronic checking product that we put out, digital,
part of our digital offering. And you cannot overdraft in that. Again, you are not charged with any overdraft fees.
And that's the third – I think it used to be the second most sought-after product or sold product within the company
over the last eight months or nine months. It may have dropped a third because our student checking campaign,
student checking pushes it up, but it's in the top three of our offering, and that's why in our guide on non-interest
income, it includes a flattening of fees in the consumer segment even though we're seeing a rise in other areas.
So there will be an impact. It's already been baked into our guidance, but that's one thing we've done and we've
made a number of other changes and are planning on changing other elements of the fee structure within the
consumer bank. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we're studying the competitive environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We can't be a market leader there. We have to step back and watch what's happening. But we were on that one
product and it's received very positive reviews and they've gone certified and it's been great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Also, if I could clarify that the duration, so the AFS duration is 3.4 at [ph] 12/31 (01:10:02). The total is 3.6, so the
HTM is at 3.7. So, they are pretty similar, but just to correct what I said earlier, it's 3.4 in the AFS portfolio.

Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney Montgomery.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Last question here or two. Just on capital, just kind of any changes in your outlook on
deployment of capital? I know you already talked a little bit about the M&A outlook with this share repurchases.
How you're thinking about that given the flexibility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure, Brian. CET1 at 9.9%, you can see in the slide deck, it's been very stable; 9.9% last quarter, 9.8% a year
ago. So, we've talked about a kind of a 10% target there. So, we're pleased with the level there. And even with

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
the strong loan growth we had, 10%, as Vince mentioned, holding the CET1 flat tells you about the earnings
generation that we're creating and retaining.
As we look forward, we've baked into our guidance is for the capital ratio to kind of slowly build from here. We're
still swapping normal loans for PPP loans, right, that have a zero risk weighting. So, but I still expect, given our
guidance for the CET1 ratio, to build, like I said gradually to get from here to the end of the year; and then, we'll
just be opportunistic on share repurchases. I mean, our first goal is to deploy it for loan growth. So, to the extent
the loan growth is stronger on the higher end, we want to use the capital to support that loan growth. But we will
be opportunistic on share purchases as we move forward in 2022. We didn't do any during the fourth quarter with
the timing of Howard and regulatory approval and those types of things. But we'll continue to monitor and just
manage capital in a way that's fully aligned with shareholder interest. But loan growth will be kind of our first lever
that we will look to deploy for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just baked into the guidance, Vince, I mean what on the – maybe you said this and I
missed it. I joined a little bit late. But just the excess liquidity, I think if you can just talk about maybe where the
core margin is in 1Q, I guess given and then just the outlook, what you have baked in for that, a drag of 26 basis
points in excess liquidity as you go throughout the year given the loan growth outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So, the excess cash for the quarter was $3.7 billion on average in the fourth quarter, so that generated the
drag that you see on the slide there. As our expectation for 2022 is that number kind of comes down in half, so it
gets to around $1.5 billion by the end of the year. Similarly, we have PPP-related deposits that are also in our
guide that we have projecting to come down about $1.3 billion or so and those have been stickier than what we've
been estimating as we've been going through the process, but that is baked into our guidance. So, basically the
cash level will go from an average of $3.7 billion and then kind of evolve to $1.5 billion by the end of the year. So,
I can't do that math in my head that quickly, I think, but that's kind of what's underneath there. So, that that impact
will lessen as we go through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. Fine. And then just one clarification on the guide. The impact of Howard and given the timing of the
close, I mean the impact to NII and not NII but just the fees and expenses and whatnot, that assumes the close
here next week or was that baked in at year-end close? Just want to make sure I clarified what you've got here on
the on the guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
