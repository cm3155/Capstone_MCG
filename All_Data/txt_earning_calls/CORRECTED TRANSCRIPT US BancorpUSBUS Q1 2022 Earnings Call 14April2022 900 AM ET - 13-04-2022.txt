MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the
results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chairman and
Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be
recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 AM Central Time through Thursday,
April 21, 2022, at 10:59 PM Central Time.
I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations for
U.S. Bancorp.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Ann Thompson
Executive Vice President & Head-Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Francie, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President, and
CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be
referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental
analyst schedules are available on our website at USbank.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page
2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I'll now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry
and I will take any questions you have.
I'll begin on slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99 and total revenue of $5.6 billion.
The quarter was highlighted by strong loan growth, continued momentum in our payments businesses, well-
controlled expenses, and strong credit quality. As expected, mortgage banking revenue declined in the first
quarter due to slower refinancing activity in the market. However, we saw good momentum in business activity
and related revenue growth within other fee businesses, including payments, trust and investment management
and treasury management. This quarter we released $50 million in loan loss reserves, reflecting continued strong
credit quality, and at March 31 our CET1 capital ratio was 9.8%.
Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the first quarter, we delivered a return on assets of 1.09% and a
return on tangible common equity of 16.6%.
Slide 5 highlights trends in digital engagement. Digital transactions account for over 80% of total transactions, and
total digital loan sales account for about two-thirds of total loan sales. We are pleased with the progress we have
seen so far, but believe there is further opportunity to increase customer engagement through digital adoption by
helping consumers and business customers understand the full scope of capabilities available to assist them in
managing their financial lives.

We are continually adding and enhancing digital features and functionality and applying a digital plus human
approach. A great example of this is our do-it-together CoBrowse technology. Through this tool, interactions with
our customers, a key driver of engagements, have increased in number and have become more efficient as well
as effective.
Turning to slide 6. We believe our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for our company.
The opportunity to connect our banking customers with our payments products and services and our payments
customers with our banking products and services will continue to drive meaningful profit and return [ph]
differential (00:03:45) for our company over the next several years.
Our small business initiative is just one example of many that we see driving both account growth and deeper
relationships. We believe the suite of products we offer to our small business customers will allow us to grow
those relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.
We are particularly encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality,
which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple, easy-to-use
format that we provide in the form of a dashboard. On the right side of the slide, you can see that the number of
new talech customers increased five-fold in 2021 compared with 2020, and that strong growth trajectory has
continued in 2022. Year-to-date, new talech customers are 1.5 times the full year 2020 level.
Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more details on the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet review, followed by a discussion of first quarter
earnings trends.
Average loans increased 3.4% compared with the fourth quarter, driven by 8.0% growth in commercial loans,
2.1% growth in mortgage loans, and 1.0% growth in total other retail loans. Commercial loan growth reflected
slowing pay-downs, increased business activity, and higher utilization rates across many sectors and most
geographies. Client sentiment is stable, and commercial lending needs are being driven by inventory building,
M&A activity, and CapEx expenditures.
In the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in residential mortgage and other retail loans, including auto lending.
Credit card balances declined linked-quarter, reflecting typical seasonality and the impact of certain loans being
moved to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter, which impacted average balance growth.
Turning to slide 8. Total average deposits increased 1.0% compared with the fourth quarter despite the typical
seasonal reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits. Total average deposits increased 6.5% compared with the
year ago.
Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. Credit quality continues to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of
non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.25% at March 31 compared with 0.28% at December
31 and 0.41% a year-ago. Our first quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.21% was slightly higher than the fourth quarter
level of 0.17%, but lower compared with the first quarter of 2021 level of 0.31%. Our allowance for credit losses
as of March 31 totaled $6.1 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans.

Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the first quarter of 2022, we earned $0.99 per diluted share. These
results included a relatively small reserve release of $50 million.
Turning to slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis totaled $3.2 billion. The 1.6% linked-
quarter increase reflected strengthening margins and strong loan growth in the quarter, particularly commercial
loan growth. Our net interest margin improved 4 basis points to 2.44% due to the changing yield curve,
investment portfolio actions, and lower cash balances, partially offset by the impact of loan mix.
Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Compared with a year-ago, non-interest income increased
0.6%, reflecting strong payments services revenue, growth in trust and investment management fees, and higher
treasury management fees, offset by lower commercial product revenue and lower mortgage banking revenue.
The decline in mortgage banking revenue reflected lower refinancing activity in the market and tighter gain on
sale margins giving excess capacity in the industry.
In the first quarter, total payments revenues increased 10.1% compared to a year earlier, reflecting both
continued cyclical post-pandemic recovery as well as strong underlying business trends supported by investments
we are making. Credit and debit card revenue increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher
credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and
debit card fee revenue would have increased 9.6% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
Both corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing fees increased at a double-digit pace
compared with a year-ago with growth driven by both the cyclical recovery of pandemic-impacted industries as
well as underlying business momentum.
Slides 13 and 14 provide additional information on our payment services business. In the middle of slide 13, we
provide a table, which illustrates the cyclicality that naturally occurs in each of our three payments businesses
over the course of a typical year. On the right side of the slide, you can see that COVID-19-impacted industries
continued to recover throughout the first quarter. As of the first quarter of 2022, credit and debit card travel
volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels. In March of 2022, airline volume was flat compared to March of 2019,
the first time we have seen recovery to pre-pandemic levels. Although T&E-related volumes in our corporate
payments business are still below pre-pandemic levels, they continue their upward trajectory. In March, corporate
T&E volumes in CPS were back to 75% of the pre-pandemic level.
Slide 14 provides linked-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses.
Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are the best
indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment.
Year-over-year, credit and debit card revenue growth rates continued to be negatively impacted by the decline in
prepaid card revenue as the benefit of the government stimulus has dissipated. We provide details on prepaid
card fee revenue over the past five quarters in the upper right quadrant. While prepaid card revenue is
approaching a run rate on a linked-quarter basis, it would impact year-over-year credit and debit card fee revenue
comparisons through the end of 2022.
The bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and
corporate payments fee revenue over the past several quarters, which have partly reflected the pandemic-related
recovery. While we expect the year-over-year growth rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to
believe that both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace
on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic environment.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Turning to slide 15. Non-interest expense decreased 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis. The decline was driven by
lower professional services expense, marketing and business development expense, and technology and
communication expenses, partially offset by increases in employee benefit expense, primarily due to seasonally
higher payroll taxes, and other non-interest expenses. Linked-quarter expense growth includes the impact of the
acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Slide 16 highlights our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31 was 9.8%. As a
reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the
pending acquisition of Union Bank. After closing the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 ratio between
our target ratio and 9.0%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our
CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close.
I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. The following guidance is for U.S. Bank on a standalone basis
and does not include any potential impact from Union Bank.
Let me start with full year guidance. We have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with market
expectations. Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect total net revenue to increase 5% to 6%
compared with 2021, reflecting 8% to 11% growth in taxable-equivalent net interest income and stable fee income
primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges offsetting growth in other fee
businesses. We expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022.
As it relates to the second quarter specifically, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 7% on a linked-quarter
basis, benefiting from seasonal strength in many of our fee businesses, continued loan growth, and the second
quarter impact of higher rates on net interest income and the recapture of fee waivers. In the second quarter, we
expect expenses to increase 1% to 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to seasonally higher
compensation-related cost and business investment spend.
Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than
historical levels, but will continue to normalize over time. For the full year 2022, we expect our taxable-equivalent
tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%.
If you turn to slide 17, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In
September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional
banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continued to make significant progress in planning for closing the
deal in the first half of 2022 while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within
the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal. We expect to close the deal
approximately 45 days after being granted US regulatory approval. Conversion is anticipated late in the second
half of 2022.
We continue to believe this deal is a compelling use of our excess capital from both a strategic and financial
perspective. We feel comfortable with our initial financial deal assumptions, including an expectation that it will
generate an internal rate of return of about 20%, which is well above our cost of capital.
Assuming a June 30 close date, we expect Union Bank to contribute approximately $310 million to our pre-tax,
pre-provision net revenue in 2022 before considering cost synergies. We continue to expect to achieve
approximately $900 million of total cost synergies related to the deal with approximately $85 million to $100
million of cost savings achieved in the second half of 2022. We continue to target total merger and integration

costs of $1.2 billion, of which approximately $950 million will be incurred in 2022 with some charges anticipated in
the second quarter as we prepare for system integration. In addition, there will be a day one loan loss provision
required at closing in accordance with the existing CECL accounting rules of approximately $800 million to $900
million.
I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry.
Our strong first quarter results position us well for the rest of the year, and we are encouraged by the loan growth
trends and business activity that we are seeing in the early part of the second quarter. Credit quality remains
strong. Nonetheless, we continue to approach credit decisions with a through-the-cycle lens. We feel good about
the secular trends we are seeing across our fee businesses.
Our payments revenue continues to recover, and we look to continued cyclical recovery in travel and
entertainment as the year progresses. More importantly, over the near and intermediate term, our multiyear
investments in this business and the strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging the power of our payments
ecosystem will continue to pay off. We are closely managing operating expenses even as we invest in our digital
initiatives, our payments capabilities, and our technology modernization. On that front, I'd like to highlight a few of
our recent announcements.
We enhanced a service that we call ExtendPay, an offering which allows our existing consumer and business
cardholders to a buy-now-pay-later option where they can choose a flexible payment plan that suits their needs.
We also rolled out a request for payment capability, which allows merchants to send bills directly to customers'
banks accounts. Those customers have the option to send payment immediately to the biller via real-time
payment rails. In February, we announced a meaningful investment in our cloud strategy, which is aimed at
modernizing our technology foundation so as to further improve the security of our data, financial assets and
customer privacy, while allowing for the transformation of applications and infrastructure to create leading-edge
customer experiences.
We will continue to leverage our suite of products, services, and capabilities to enhance the customer experience,
which we believe will support meaningful account growth and deeper relationships across our entire franchise
over the next several years.
In closing, 2022 is off to a good start, and I'd like to thank our employees for all they do to support our strategic
goals, and continue to serve our customers and communities.
We will now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from
Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping you could...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hi Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
...provide an update on asset sensitivity of USB standalone and then the impact of UB. I know at one point you
said it was going to make you a little more asset-sensitive but, obviously, the rate environment has changed. I'm
not really sure what's happened to their balance sheet. So, some updates there on asset sensitivity, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Matt, let me kind of take that question. With respect to asset sensitivity, and I'm going to kind of refer back
to maybe the disclosures we had in the 10-K, and probably the best one to look at would be kind of an upward
gradual 200 basis point movement. I think that that is at least the environment that the market implied with
[indiscernible] (00:20:13) point in time. So, if you end up applying that rate sensitivity of about 5.4% to the fourth
quarter, I think it gives you a pretty good estimate of what sort of benefit that we see in terms of net interest
income kind of going forward.
Maybe kind of qualitatively, I think that when we see early in the cycle, deposit betas will be relatively low. Our
portfolio, when you look at loans, it's probably about 50%, 55% is floating rate and about 45% to 50% is fixed rate.
So that, Matt, probably gives you some perspective with respect to kind of what we're expecting to see.
From a Union Bank point of view, as we've said in the past, it is a bit more asset-sensitive than us. It should help
us kind of, I would say, 35 to 40 basis points. When you end up looking at their portfolio and the assets that we'll
be acquiring, it's deposit-heavy. So, we'll have substantial amount of cash and the opportunity to be able to
reinvest that as rates move up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, separately, you gave the impact of the UB deal on tangible book value. I think it was just a 1%
reduction. What's the estimated impact on CET1 capital, both from the actual acquisition and then the upfront
mark that you mentioned earlier?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, as we've said, currently we're at 9.8% in terms of our CET1 ratio. We would expect it'll be in the range
of that 8.5% to 9% at the end of the closing. Of course, it'll be dependent upon how much rates move between
now and the actual closing time. I talked a little bit about the day one provision in terms of the credit mark. From
an asset mark, I think it'll be a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated or disclosed in at the time of
the acquisition simply because of the rise in rates, but not significantly different.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And just a suggestion, by the way. Lots of good guidance on the call. It would be great if you could
put some of it in the slides. It's just such a busy day, and scrambling to jot it all down. Some of your peers do that,
and it's really helpful for us on this side. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. We would anticipate we'll start to incorporate more of that as the deal moves forward.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the card and payment side, just curious if you can just give us a little bit more detail on what
you're seeing in terms of consumer spend behavior. Are you seeing any signs of any pullbacks and shifts in the
type of spend that could point to some softening there? We're starting to see some shifts towards
nondiscretionary from discretionary spend. Curious if you're seeing that in your business, if that is impacting your
outlook at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So let me start and then Andy can kind of add to it. Certainly, what we are continuing to see, John, through
the first quarter is good, strong both year-over-year growth and comparisons back to 2019 really across the
board. I think a couple of the trends that we talked about is that travel, specifically airline, was back to pre-
pandemic. So, that's continuing to develop and grow, and that's occurred specifically in March. And I think you'll
see that continuing as we think about the second quarter and beyond.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
We do continue to expect in the CPS business that travel and entertainment is going to continue to strengthen,
and I think that that is a tailwind or an opportunity for us as we move forward. I would expect that there's probably
going to be a shift to some extent from what I would call durable goods that people were spending their dollars on
in the past to more service-oriented sort of activities. But in terms of the overall level of spend, I feel like that will
continue at least for some period of time.
Andy, what would you add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that's a good summary, Terry. John, it's interesting because consumer spend on the merchant side, if we
look at that data versus pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter still up 9% to 15%. Consumer credit card spend
still up versus pre-pandemic 35% and corporate payments still up 10%. The one area Terry mentioned that is not
back to recovery yet is corporate T&E, which is about 75% of what is normal or pre-pandemic levels, and we
would expect that to continue to get better as we all start to get out on the road more. So, we're not seeing any
negative trends thus far, and it continues to be very strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the commercial side, I know you cited in your prepared
remarks that you are beginning to see CapEx plans as a driver behind the loan growth dynamics on the
commercial side. Do you expect that to continue as we look out here or do you foresee a potential impact on
borrower appetite amid still the inflationary dynamics and supply chain issues and Ukraine?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that the capital expenditure is probably driven by a couple different things. I think that most
businesses over the course of the last couple years have been kind of holding back with respect to capital
expenditure. And so, I think that there's a bit of an increase in that spend just related to that. And then I do think
that as companies see more and more inflationary pressure, they are going to look to business and business
automation as ways of kind of offsetting some of the pressure that they see with respect to being actually to
acquire talent. And so, I think that our expectation, at least in the near term, is that capital expenditure will
continue to be reasonably strong.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And I think our utilization rates support that, Terry. We have been running in that 19%, plus or minus, for a
number of quarters, and we saw it increase certainly not to normal levels, but in the 22% to 23% in the last few
months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey Ryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on deposit betas. So now that you mentioned that early in the cycle
you're expecting deposit betas to be relatively low. So, on one hand, you have an industry with a lot of excess
liquidity, but then on the other hand, you have consumers that might be a little bit more cognizant of rate hikes
coming faster with inflation on the headlines every day, you have rising fintech competition. So, putting that all
together, I'm wondering how you're thinking about deposit betas really over the first 100 bps and then the
following rates after that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So maybe I think it's helpful to maybe have a little context. When you end up looking at our deposit
balances, about 50% of it is consumer-based and 50% of it is institutional, if you will, which tends to have a little
bit of a higher beta. But our expectation, especially early in the cycle, is that betas will move relatively slow. And
then as we get further into the development of the cycle, it'll start to accelerate a bit.
But to kind of give you some perspective, we would expect probably through the full cycle of 2022 that betas on
the consumer will be less than 10% and then maybe slightly higher that on a terminal basis. On the institutional
side, we would expect through the 2022 cycle somewhere between 50% and 60% with a terminal level that's
maybe a little bit higher than that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Couple things to that. As we are looking at it, we believe that relative to, for example, the last cycle that our
deposit betas will be a little bit less sensitive for a couple of different reasons. One is the consumer balances are
larger by about 5% relative to the last cycle. Our corporate trust deposit balances are lower, and so the mix of the
deposit basis change. And then we have moved away from concentrations related to brokerage-related type of
deposits, which we had more of in the past. We still have some, but a lower concentration. So, all of those things
are going to drive lower beta growth than what we saw in the past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. That's really helpful color. And then just as a follow-up, wondering if you could dig into the book value per
share decline of 9% linked-quarter. How much of that came from AOCI drawdowns on the AFS portfolio? And is
there anything you can do to mitigate the AOCI hit going forward if the rate outlook keeps moving higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. The vast majority, if not all of it, was really tied to the change in the unrealized gains and losses on the
investment portfolio.
And then the driver, when we think about the future, we started to change a couple of different things. So, in the
fourth quarter, we moved about $43 billion of our investment securities to held-to-maturity. As we are reinvesting
run-off associated with the investment portfolio, we'll continue to move more and more of that into the held-to-
maturity sort of category. And then certainly, as we close on Union Bank, we have the opportunity after the mark
to move a lot of that into held-to-maturity as well. So, today, about 30% of the overall portfolio is in the held-to-
maturity category, and our expectation is over some period of time we would move that percentage up
significantly.

Hi. Good morning. Just putting together the most recent question and also on Matt's question, underneath the 8%
to 11% NII growth, could you give us a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of what you're expecting for asset
growth given the strength in your loan book today? And, Terry, [indiscernible] (00:31:55) short-term borrowings
but period-end by $10 billion. And again, going back to the question I think everybody is trying to ask, remind us
how much of your deposit base is corporate trust today? And of those deposits, how much are indexed? Do they
reprice immediately to the changes in underlying benchmark rates or do you have some ability and pricing power
to be able to perhaps delay some of that repricing?

Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So let me start with the last question and then kind of talk a little bit about the deposits. And then to the
extent that I don't cover everything, just remind me. But deposits in the corporate trust business or in institutional,
the investment services group, which includes corporate trust, represent about 15% of the total interest-bearing
deposits. Now, in the last rate cycle, that was about 22%. So, it's down relative to the overall mix. And then the
vast majority of it is not indexed to any particular rate. And so, we do have the ability to manage that. A fair
amount of the deposits within corporate trust are non-interest-bearing as well, which I think is helpful. That
percentage is probably a little bit higher than what it was in the past. But the competitive pressure will really come
as money market funds start to move up. We do have the ability to lag relative to that, but that's where some of
that competitive pressure comes from.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
A follow-up on the underlying earning asset assumption that you have, underneath the 8% – yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, when we end up looking at earning assets, our expectation is that the investment portfolio will be
relatively flat or stable really through the end of the year, and the vast majority of the growth will come on the loan
portfolio side of the equation. As we look into the second quarter, our expectation is that loan growth will continue
to be strong. And this – and as reminder, it was up on a linked-quarter basis about 3.4%. And while it may not be
at that level, I think it'll still be up on a linked-quarter basis very nicely. And we would continue to expect good,
solid growth in the C&I portfolio as well as credit cards will start to seasonally get stronger, et cetera.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And a follow-up question to Matt's question on CET1. When you close Union Bank, I think I'm estimating
your total asset size to be just shy of $690 billion. And how should we think about capital management as you
potentially approach $700 billion asset mark in two years, Andy and Terry? And I'm just wondering in context of
the TCE hit was obviously more than the CET1 hit because AOCI doesn't run through your CET1. So, I guess, I'm
wondering in terms of, like buybacks, even after you replenish to 9% as you think about crossing the $700 billion,
how that might influence your capital management and capital return potentially differently over the next two
years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Erika, I think your estimates with respect to the total size are reasonable. Our expectation is that – to kind
of give you some perspective, when you end up looking at the rules, the rules say that you need to be at an
average of over a four-quarter period above $700 million (sic) [$700 billion] (00:36:02). So, there's a bit of runway
that exists between now and when we might become a category two sort of entity.
Some of the actions that I talked about with respect to the held-to-maturity composition of the investment portfolio
I think will help kind of mitigate that. Certainly, we'll generate a fair amount of earnings between now and, let's
say, six or seven quarters out, and I think all those things will kind of help us manage through that timeframe.

The other thing is that when we do close on Union Bank, it's deposit-heavy in terms of the mix. So, there will be a
significant amount of cash, and we would expect to utilize that to help us manage borrowings down and things like
that in order to be able to stay below that $700 billion threshold for an extended period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Just to clarify. As you close UB, the intention for the cash is not to deploy it, but to shrink the pro forma
balance sheet to be able to accommodate more client growth rather than just raw balance sheet growth from?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Exactly. Exactly.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a question on fees to start. In your revenue guide, do you fully
contemplate the full recovery of fee waivers, which I think you said you've been running around $70 million? How
much do you have that recovering in 2Q? And I assume that's also fully recovered in the full year guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, to answer the last piece, yes, it would be fully recovered certainly by the end of the year. And just given
kind of projections in the marketplace with respect to rates, we'll see a significant amount of that recovered in the
second quarter with the residual amount kind of in the third quarter. Maybe as a reminder, we recover about 65%
of it in the first 25 basis point movement, 90% of it in the next 25 basis point movement, and all of it after the third
25 basis point movement. So, most of it in the second quarter, but some amount in the third.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, about 70% of it comes back in the second quarter, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thank you, Terry. And then also, just on the mortgage business, obviously, the reset that you had given us
the expectation for, just your outlook from here given where rates have gone and the ins and outs of production
and servicing? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Obviously, the mortgage banking business is going to trend along with, at this particular point in time,
refinancings. The mix of business is probably 70% home sales and 30% refinancing. So, on a linked-quarter
basis, the impact of refinancings will be less than what it has been in the past. So, it'll come down to kind of home
sale activity. We continue to think that that'll be reasonably strong and our investment in kind of the retail channel
will be good.
I think the things that'll be drivers, Ken, in the future on a linked-quarter basis will really be where do gain-on-sale
margins go, and that'll be driven based upon how fast the capacity comes out of the system. But at least at this
particular point in time, just looking at kind of industry metrics I think is a good way of kind of thinking about how
we'll perform as well.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

Just to clarify. So, you improved 2022 guidance, revenues from 3% to 4% to 5% to 6%, NII from 5% to 8% to
11%, and operating leverage from 100 basis points to 200 basis points. I just want to make sure I have my facts
straight there. Is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, that improved guidance, how much of that is due simply to higher interest rates, how much of that is
due to better loan growth, and how much of that is due to payments or some other activities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that, again, we would expect that fee income will be relatively stable on a year-over-year basis. So,
when you end up looking at what's going to be the driver, it'll be net interest income. And from here on out, I think
it's going to be kind of a balance between loan growth and interest rates. Because if I had to kind of give you a
mix, and I don't necessarily have that with me, but it's probably 60%, 65% rates and 30%, 35% on the loan
portfolio growth side of the equation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, your commercial loan growth is kind of fast. And I think you said there might have been a onetime
element in there, but what sort of commercial loan growth are you expecting? Is this the big pivot recovery from
the pandemic? Is it inventory build? Is it CapEx? Is it differences by region? This might wind up being some of the
best commercial loan growth that we see on a linked-quarter basis percentage-wise than any big bank, so just a
little more color around that would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Mike. I'll start. This is Andy, and Terry will add on. It's across all those categories I mentioned earlier – and
there is no one-timer in there, so it is core growth. One of the factors is our utilization rates, as I mentioned, have
been hovering in that 19-or-so percent and they're up nearly 23%, which is a key component, which is again take
downs to fund all those things you talked about, which is CapEx and inventory growth and other activities. It's
fairly widespread. It's true within our large corporate as well as our middle market and spread geographically as
well. So, it is strength across many categories.
Terry, what would you add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
The other thing I would just say is that we'll start to see some seasonal benefit associated with the credit card
portfolio as we get into the second and third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then the other part of that question related to payments. I think payments was a little bit of a
disappointment for a little bit of time, and now it's come back a little bit this quarter, 10% year-over-year growth.
So, I guess, is payments back or not back? Or is it performing to your expectations? Are there still headwinds or
is the recovery from the pandemic helping that business? Just how do you think about payments relative to your
own expectations and the market's expectations?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, we're very excited about the payments business. I think there's a number of dynamics that are
taking place. I think there's still cyclical recovery that's going to continue on for some period of time, and you're
going to see that in the airline and travel and entertainment and those sorts of areas. I think that's all good.
Mike, we've talked a lot about investments that we've been making in our payments businesses. And over the
course of the last few years, as an example within the merchant acquiring, three years ago or so, our tech-led sort
of revenue represented about 15% of our overall merchant acquiring revenue. Today, it represents 30%, and we
would expect that to continue to accelerate because of investments that we're making.
We talked about the fact that in a normal environment, as the cyclical recovery kind of starts to wane that we
would expect our merchant acquiring and our CPS business to grow in high single-digits. That's two or three times
what we were seeing, let's say, four years ago when we started our investment. So, we feel really good about
where we're at from a payments perspective at this particular point.
Andy, what would you add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that's right. And, Mike, when you asked about the guidance and Terry mentioned that fees are relatively
stable, that is mortgage coming down a fair bit as well as deposit service charges with some of the changes that
we made in overdrafts, which is offset positively by some of our payments businesses and the expectations that
we now have for the full year as well as the trust businesses. So, there's some value and diversification of those
revenue streams, and it's coming through in payments and trust.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That was a detailed answer. If I could just push the limit, so any numbers around the payments growth? Should it
be high single- digits? Can you keep that 10% growth up or should it settle back down to a lower range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, I think if you end up looking at the components, merchant and CPS on an ongoing basis, high
single-digits. I think credit card will be probably at a lower level than that, but it'll be consistent with the way the
rest of the industry is growing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And part of that credit card comp, Mike, is the prepaid impacts of prior year is still impacting the comps year-over-
year in 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Andy, morning, Terry. Just a clarification there. So, the high single-digit on merchant processing and corporate
payments, are you referring to that for 2022 or beyond? Because the credit card should be hurt in 2022, but after
that those comps should get easier, so what do you think post 2022 for credit cards? So, just want to clarify those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Again, for merchant and CPS, we think post-2022 high single-digits, and we believe that credit card will perform
kind of consistent with the rest of the industry. The comps, as you say, this year will be impacted by the prepaid
card revenue that is coming down, but then that starts to normalize as you get into 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And within this high single-digits, are you expecting any more big contract renewals that could impact this or is
that factored into your guidance or are you just not expecting much of that to come up in...
[indiscernible] (00:47:20)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. We don't expect a lot of that. The large contracts that got renegotiated were more on the CPS side of the
equation about two years ago, and that's kind of fully in the run rate at this particular point in time. As you know,
those contracts are usually 10, 12 years in length, so we don't see anything on the horizon there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. One request, and that is FICO mix of your loan portfolios. I know we've talked about this in the past. Could
you look into actually disclosing it? Your peers do, and I think given your high consumer mix of loans, it would be
very helpful to have that.

Good morning, Gerard.

Hi Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi Terry. Hi Andy. Terry, following up your comments on the mortgage banking business, with the rates where
they are and possibly going higher, probably depressing refinancing activity for the industry as well as yourselves
because of the higher rates, can you attempt or can you look to growing your home equity business, home equity
lines, et cetera? This business, of course, for the industry and yourselves has been a line of business that has
been shrinking over the years, but could that be an alternative to people refinancing moving into home equity
lines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that it certainly won't shrink at the same level it has been shrinking, Gerard, just for the reasons you
mentioned because of refinancing people would have money out and that would replace home equity, so to
speak. So I think you'll see a positive trend there. It certainly is not going to offset the mortgage impacts directly,
but I think it will be positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And is there any plan on your guys' part to maybe be more aggressive in marketing those products or have you
not really thought about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
We're always looking at opportunities to serve the customers in areas they need. Another sort of related is the
whole buy-now-pay-later component that we talked about. I mentioned some examples in my prepared remarks.
But as you think about home equity improvements, a new way of financing that is through a buy-now-pay-later or
financing a point-of-sale. So, that's something we're also focused on.

Got it. And then second, obviously, U.S. Bancorp has distinguished itself over the years with having a very strong
focus on credit and delivering very strong returns to shareholders. The question I have because credit, obviously,
is not an issue today for most banks, yours included, when do you start to get nervous or do you get nervous in
this interest rate environment? The fed comes through and we have 200 basis points of fed funds at the end of
the year and possibly a 10-year that's well above 3%. How do you guys kind of think about that when you assess
the risks for the business here at U.S. Bancorp?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Fair question. And I think there's a lot more conversation around that in terms of whether or not there will
be recessionary sort of pressures 12 to 18 months out. I would start by just saying when we end up looking at the
economic outlook right now and kind of what we're seeing, we continue to see a pretty robust environment.
That said, Gerard, I think it's a fair question because credit issues that we – decisions we made today and a year
ago are what's going to affect us, and we never really changed our underwriting approach. We've always been
very focused on, as an example, in the consumer side, we focus on prime and super prime customers, in our card
business, in our auto business, et cetera. I think the mortgage – just the underwriting associated with mortgages
is different today than it was 10, 15 years ago, which will help. But then on the C&I side of the equation or the
corporate side of the equation, we do very little leverage lending sort of activities. And areas that have been kind
of structurally impacted like retail, et cetera, retail malls, et cetera, we've kind of made a lot of changes to our
portfolio the last several years. So, I actually think that we'll perform quite well in the event that we were to see
recessionary pressures develop.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, Terry, just to follow up there. How about – from a balance sheet standpoint, you talked about moving more
of your available-for-sale into held-to-maturity in your bond portfolio. In this rising rate environment, do we start to
see greater risks in that part of the business, not just for U.S. Bancorp, but maybe for the industry as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Within, for example, the investment portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Correct. Correct. Just the marks that people may have to take. I know held-to-maturity you don't mark-to-market,
but I'm just wondering because we haven't had to focus on this in, God, years. And I'm just wondering if there's
something that we need to keep our eyes open for.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, I think it's worthwhile just kind of trying to understand the mix of the types of investment securities
that people are putting into their particular portfolio. When you get into stress in the economy, et cetera, certain
types of investments may not perform as well. In terms of our own portfolio, highly concentrated in treasury and
government-backed mortgage-backed securities, so we don't see a lot of credit risk in our particular portfolio. But
it is something I think from an industry standpoint it's worthwhile watching.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. If I go back to September, I think you expected to realize 25%
of the cost savings from Union this year, which was about $225 million. Terry, I believe on the call, was it $85
million to $100 million this year, and is that just simply a function of pushing out the conversion too late in 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. It's all related to the timing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then your thoughts on 2023, the full 100% by the end of the year, any kind of update on 2023 when the
bulk of that savings will occur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, I think that the bulk of that savings – we certainly start to realize some of it later this year, but the
bulk of it does get realized in 2023. And certainly, when we get close to the end of the fourth quarter and first
quarter of 2024, the vast majority of it will be realized. So I think the timing is very consistent with what we talked
about, just affected by the timing of the deal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, the 6% decline in non-interest-bearing deposits, I think that was
on an average basis. In the release, it was seasonal kind of factors coming into play. Anything beyond that in
terms of the decline or do you truly think that was just a seasonal component?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. With our corporate trust business, we always see a ramp-up in that type of deposit near the end of the year
as deals try to get closed. And almost like clockwork, around the 10th of January and through February, we see a
run-off. So, it's all really seasonal from our standpoint.

than when we exited the last ZIRP cycle and the risk of non-interest-bearing deposits outflowing perhaps a bit
faster and perhaps impacts on deposit betas. Could you comment on that? And if you already have, I'll just go
back to the transcript.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. No, it's a good question. And as we kind of go through the modeling and we look at the information and
kind of how we think it's going to end up affecting not only us, but I think the industry, is that you're going to see
that deposit growth is going to slow. And our expectation is certainly that deposit levels overall will grow slowly
and that'll be more in line with just the overall growth of the economy. So, our expectation is that deposits
continue to grow, but at a lower rate.

Understood. And then following up on your commentary, I believe, Andy, around new point-of-sale solutions that
you're looking at, there seems to be a little bit of debate among some banks who appear willing to promote the
use of Zelle for retail payments versus others that would prefer to wait. Can you remind us where USB stands in
that debate and how you think about the risk of a product like Zelle potentially cannibalizing some of your
payments volume?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
What we're focused on with Zelle is just increasing the utilization of Zelle across our customer base. I think it's a
terrific product. It has a lot of use cases. We're looking at different use cases but, overall, what we're trying to do
is just increase the utilization.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2022
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And then, finally, if I may. I guess, following up on the strengths you're seeing in the merchant
acquiring side, there's been this view among some fintech investors that Elavon is a legacy player using legacy
technology and losing share in merchant acquiring. But Nielsen published its market share stats for the top US
merchant acquirers, and it shows Elavon actually moved up from number eight in 2020 to number seven based
on dollar volume. So, from where you stand, do you think the investments that you're making in talech and other
digital initiatives could actually help you continue to gain share in the acquiring space or is it more effectively
protecting your position?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No. We do think, Bill, it can allow us to gain share. I think it's a combination of a number of things. Terry talked
about the investments we made over the last three or four years. Our focus on tech-led initiatives and selling
points differently than it was four or five years ago. And then that combination of bringing banking together with
merchant processing into a comprehensive product set, we talked about talech and the dashboard. I think all
those things position us well for future growth, both growth within the customer base that we have, but also
expanding and acquiring new customers.
