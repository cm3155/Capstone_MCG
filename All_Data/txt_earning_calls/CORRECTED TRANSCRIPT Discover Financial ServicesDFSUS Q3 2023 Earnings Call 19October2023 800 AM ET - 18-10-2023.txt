Director, Interim Chief Executive Officer & President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As I shared a few months ago, I had three
priorities in my role as interim CEO. First is continued delivering a great customer experience at every touch point,
which we do by providing our customers an award-winning service and products.
At the heart of this is a team of more than 20,000 employees connected by common values and a shared mission
to help people achieve a brighter financial future. Our second priority is to advance our culture of compliance. We
made significant strides in this area. By now, you've all had the opportunity to review the consent order issued by
the FDIC in September.
Consistent with the terms of this consent order, we have made meaningful investments in improving our corporate
governance and enterprise risk management capabilities and expect to drive further enhancements across the
organization in the coming quarters. We've also started the process of engaging with our merchant partners on
the card misclassification issue, we remain in active dialogue with our regulators on this topic.
The resolution of this issue is likely to be complex, and we anticipate it will take several quarters fully resolved. My
third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance.

John T. Greene
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide 4. In the
quarter, we reported net income of $683 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior year quarter.
Provision expense grew by $929 million, reflecting an increase in reserves and charge-offs, strong loan growth,
along with changing macroeconomic and household liquidity conditions drove the increase to our reserve
balance. Charge-offs increased due to portfolio seasoning and remain in line with expectations.
Revenue grew 17%, deposits grew 23% and expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Further details are reflected
on slide 5. Net interest income was up $479 million year-over-year or 17%, our net interest margin ended the
quarter at 10.95%, down 10 basis points from the prior year and down 11 basis points sequentially.
This decrease was driven by higher funding costs which were partially offset by the benefits from higher prime
rates. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth in a
lower payment rate versus the prior year.
The payment rate declined about 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but remains just under 200 basis points
above 2019 levels. Sales volume was relatively flat for the quarter. Personal loans were up 25%, driven by
strength in originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer
demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting.
Student loans were up 1%. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 23%
year-over-year and 4% sequentially, our direct-to-consumer balances grew $4 billion. Looking at other revenue on
slide 6. Noninterest income increased $97 million or 16%, this was primarily driven by higher transaction
processing revenue from our PULSE business, an increase in loan fee income and strong net discount and
interchange revenue.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Moving to expenses on slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $86 million or 6% year-over-year and up 4%
from the prior quarter. This increase is driven primarily by investments in our compliance and risk management
programs and is reflected across several of our expense line items.
Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $24 million or 4%, primarily from
increased head count. The increase in information processing expense was driven by software licensing
renewals. Professional fees reflect an increase in third-party support as we focus on accelerating our compliance
and risk management efforts.
Moving to credit performance on slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.52%, 181 basis points higher than the prior
year and up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer
accounts, which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages. Losses remain consistent with targeted
ranges. These newer vintages support strong long-term profitability.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $601 million, and
our reserve rate increased by 22 basis points to just over 7%. The reserve increase reflects a modest
deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, increasing delinquencies and higher loan balances. Our macro
assumptions reflect a relatively strong labor market, but also consumer headwinds from declining savings rates
and increasing debt burdens.
Looking at slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.6%. The sequential decline of 10 basis
points was driven largely by our strong organic asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per
share of common stock. Concluding on slide 11 with our outlook. We now expect our loan growth to be in the mid-
teens as declining payment rates are offsetting the impact of slowing sales. There is no change to our NIM
expectations to be approximately 11% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for operating expenses
to be up low double digits, and there is no change to our expected range for net charge-offs to be between 3.4%
and 3.6% for the year.
In conclusion, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to generate solid financial results while
building out our compliance and risk management capabilities and prudently investing in actions that drive
sustainable long-term performance.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get a little bit more on the reserve build. As we look ahead, John Greene,
could you just talk about like how we should think about that reserve rate increasing from here because obviously,
you made some adjustments, but you've said the credit numbers are performing pretty consistent with your
expectations. So is it a reflection on how you see things unfolding next year. Maybe you can just talk about the
relation and how we should think about that reserve coverage on a go-forward basis, assuming the
unemployment assumptions don't change much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. I appreciate the question. So let me back up and just give a little bit of overview in terms of
what happened in the quarter and why we increased the reserve rate. So as we took a look at through the
portfolio performance and the loan growth, obviously, we had to make reserve build for loan growth and that
represented about 50% of the $600 million. The other 50% or approximately $300 million reflected our view on the
macros.
Now while the unemployment numbers remain relatively in line and strong by historical standards. We are seeing
some indications of stress. And if we go back to the pandemic and learnings there, we found that certainly
unemployment remains an important factor in terms of reserves, but there's other factors. And what we've done
over the past years, try to build into those other factors into our loss models and reserve models, and we've done
that.
So as we took a look at household net worth and savings rate, both have deteriorated, and we're seeing
deterioration more specifically in lower FICO bands, so we use those macro factors in order to capture loss
content that we felt was appropriate from a reserving standpoint. So, as we look at reserve levels today and into
the future, there's a couple of things that I'll say are just kind of general process items.
First, it'll be dependent on the macro views and whether they remain stable or deteriorating. Second, certainly, the
portfolio performance will be a very, very important factor. And then, third will be the timing and trajectory of loss
content. So, as losses become closer in terms of our projection period, they're probability adjusted and therefore
could increase reserve rate.
Now, there's a lot of detail that I just provided. So, let me give a view of our expectations. So, first, the portfolio is
performing generally well, although we are seeing mildly increased stress at the lower FICO bands to mid FICO
bands. We're also seeing that 2022 vintage performed slightly worse than 2021, 2023, although highly profitable.
So, as we look forward to 2024, we'll run our process and adjust the reserve as we deem most appropriate.
An important piece will also be the charge-off trajectory. So, what we've said previously is we expect charge-offs
to peak sometime around the midpoint of the year to the second half of the year – second half of 2024. So, if we
don't see a slowing in delinquency rates between now and first quarter, certainly, that could be an indication that
6

we'll have to take incremental provisions. So, a lot there, hopefully enough for you to be able to digest and move
forward with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, thank you. That's great. And just under the banner of sort of regulatory stuff, question number one, it
doesn't seem like there's a whole lot to update in terms of other actions. We obviously got the consent order. And
then, I saw in the perspective for 2023, you still have a pause for the capital management piece, not any change
to that. So, could you just give us a sense of sort of how to think about that unpausing of the share repurchase? I
know John Owen mentioned, it might take several quarters to resolve the merchant issue. So, just trying to
reconcile those comments. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one, too, Sanjay. So, let me first start out by saying our capital allocation priorities aren't
changed. So, invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. That's very clear from our business
model, our management team and our board.
The second piece to the answer relates to our continued work on the card tiering issue and other governance
issues. So we're making reasonably good progress on both of those. And what we'll do as part of our 2024
planning process, we'll make a recommendation to the board regarding our capital actions and specifically the
buyback, and then we'll provide an update on our January call associated with our fourth quarter earnings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John B. Owen A
Director, Interim Chief Executive Officer & President, Discover Financial Services
Let me just add a little bit to John's answer on kind of where we are from a regulatory standpoint. The FDIC
consent order that was made public this month related to really the findings from end of 2021, looking back. As
we've said before, we've made significant investments in our risk management and compliance capabilities over
the last 18 months.
From a spending standpoint, we've increased our spending from $225 million in 2022 to about $460 million in
2023. What I would tell you is we've made good progress resolving many of our issues, but we still have a
significant amount of work to do before we're satisfied with where we are.
On the card misclassification issue, it's not part of that FDIC consent order. That's a separate matter. And where
we are on that, as we've mentioned before, we did have an outside law firms completed an investigation on the
card misclassification issue. That work is substantially complete at this point in time. We've shared that result of
that with our board of directors and also with our regulators. And at this point in time, we're awaiting feedback
from our regulators.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the reserve rate comments, John Greene. You referenced
several macro variables impacting the reserve and you also cited higher delinquencies, which are more
idiosyncratic. Some investors are concerned that rising DQs may be a function of more than just seasoning.
Maybe could you just help us with what your response would be to the concern that some investors have
expressed that the outsized reserve build is a sign that Discover may have reached for growth too aggressively
during the pandemic and is now facing the consequences perhaps what could ultimately end up being greater
credit degradation in 2024 and possibly beyond particularly since we're still in an environment where the
unemployment rate is 3.5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So let me go back a little bit. And be real clear about what happened at the second half of
2021 and 2022 in terms of originations. So second half of 2021, we resumed and we went back to our traditional
credit box.
In the early part of 2022, we continued with that traditional Discover credit box. We did do a test in marginal prime
and near prime, which we turned on. We saw the results and we turned off in the second quarter or early third
quarter of 2022. So about six months of origination, not dramatic volume by any means, but certainly a test was
good opportunity to learn to see if we could capture some profitable share.
What we found was those accounts weren't meeting our return of volatility thresholds. So they were shut down.
The rest of the 2022 vintage was within the traditional credit box that Discover had. And 2023 remains there,
although we're peeling back. I will say this, the 2022 vintage was certainly outsized as a result of demand and
great execution from our marketing team. The profitability of that still remains very, very strong in the short term,
medium term and long term. So if we're going to do it all over again, at this point, we'd certainly answer
definitively. Yes, we would continue to originate the loans that we put on the books.
But the vintage is significantly larger than other vintages. So the natural loss content of new originations is
somewhere between 12 and 24 months. And we expect that to play out. And as I said, the delinquencies and
charge-offs to peak sometime in 2024. So, I hope that is helpful in terms of giving a little bit of color in terms of the
process we went through, our risk tolerance and what we expect to see from those vintages.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yes. That's helpful. Thanks, John. I appreciate that. If I could ask a follow-up of John Owen. Could you speak to
the possibility of potentially I guess, your overall interest level and potentially pursuing strategic alternatives for
any of the other businesses, whether that'd be student lending or anything else. Or is that more likely to wait –
even more likely to hold off until the new CEO kind of comes on board, which you mentioned is probably in the
next several months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John B. Owen A
Director, Interim Chief Executive Officer & President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Happy to talk about that. As you know, we really can't speculate or talk about rumors or selling parts of the
business. What I can tell you is part of our strategic planning process that we do every year is to evaluate all of
8

our businesses for returns and fit from a strategic standpoint. We do that as an annual process. We are going

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey good morning guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Good morning, Ryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So John, you reiterated the expense guidance for 2023, which is obviously a positive. And I'm sure you're going
through the budgeting process right now. But I guess based on what you know today regarding the consent order,
the work that John Owen, that you referenced that you're doing, you've made substantial progress plus overall
inflation. Any sense for what expense growth is going to look like into 2024? Maybe just talk about some of the
moving pieces that you expect to drive the expense base next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Sure. I'm not going to be real specific on 2024. We're still in the process of building out the budget, and we're yet
to share our recommendation with the board. But I can give you a general kind of direction of what we're seeing.
So, the first point I think is important to put out there is that, we continue to target our efficiency ratio to be below
40%.
Now that's over the medium term. Obviously, our execution this year with the revenue growth and even with
substantial investments in compliance and other areas of the business shows an efficiency ratio significantly
below 40%. But over the mid-term, that's something I think investors can expect.
The second piece that's important is that despite a significant amount of investment in risk and compliance
resources, we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of expense dollars. And we're focused on making
sure that the expense dollars that we do spend either help us with our compliance and risk management
programs overall or generate positive earnings potential for the firm. So, they're the focal point.
In terms of some of the things we continue to look at, we're looking at our facilities footprint. We expect to be able
to continue to make some progress on that. Our third-party spend we're scrutinizing significantly with the help of
our procurement and vendor management teams. And we're going to continue to look at resource levels to make
sure they're appropriate for the environment and what we're trying to execute on. So I hope that provides some
9

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
context, Ryan, on how we're thinking about the expense base in the aggregate. And that will translate into what
we hope is a reasonably good set of expense and efficiency numbers into the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for the color. Maybe the follow-up on some of Sanjay and Bill's question. So when I think about the
comments that you and John made regarding the trajectory of the 2022 vintage, 2023 likely hasn't begun to
season yet inflation's weighing on consumers. Can you maybe just help us understand more broadly just thinking
about how we should see the trajectory of delinquencies, meaning could we actually see the underperformance
that we've experienced get worse as we sort of go through this next period of time given that you do have this
really big vintage that's coming through. And any commentary on framing how much of this is seasoning and how
much of the delinquency performance is seasoning of the book versus actual underlying deterioration that you're
seeing in the core customer base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah, a lot of parts there, Ryan. Let me start by kind of walk you through what we're seeing in the portfolio. So,
we are seeing kind of differences in performance on customers that historically have been transactor versus
revolver. So our revolver base, we're seeing a more significant decrease in sales activity, which makes sense,
right, as they try to manage their household budget. We're seeing accounts that transacted in 2021, 2020 and
2022 beginning to revolve more. So the revolve rate is back to where we were historically.
And the 2023 vintages, early indications are that it's performing very, very well. 2022 is performing well, but not as
well as 2023. So my expectation is that delinquencies will slow in the first half of 2024. If that doesn't happen,
that's an indication that the stress that the consumers are seeing is more significant than what we're observing
today.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks very much. Actually, most of my questions and the fact just even the last question was exactly
overlapping. So, maybe I'll just quickly ask number one is maybe quick update on kind of the competitive
environment, what kind of zero balance kind of transfer activity you're engaging in and other kind of factors that
you would tie to competition as kind of the credit environment maybe migrates a little bit? And then what are you
guys – on that front, what are you doing with respect to underwriting to account for some of these changes that
you're seeing as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Great. Yeah, I'll take that. So the environment continues to be competitive from a card origination standpoint. We
are seeing less competition in kind of the lower FICO band. So remember, we're a prime revolver, so we're
10


Discover Financial Services
(DFS) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
focused on prime customers and the lower tier of origination envelope is, frankly, less competitive. So we're
careful as we're looking at that to make sure that those folks seeking credit are worthy of credit and not going to
turn into a subsequent charge-off.
The upper prime remains very, very competitive. The rewards competition, you can see it by the television ads
has certainly subsided significantly. So the market's always competitive. The competition varies among various
FICO bands. And we're going to continue to compete and generate positive new accounts, but we're also mindful
of the credit situation.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene, just wanted to follow-up on the commentary of
peak losses. I think you mentioned sometime in mid to late 2024. I think last quarter, you talked about maybe this
getting pushed into 2025. Is there a risk that maybe the peak kind of plateaus at or around those higher levels? Or
do you think, as your 2020 vintage kind of peaks out and starts moderating in size, the losses and delinquencies
should just naturally drift lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I think it will peak and then upon its peak, I think it will stabilize up there for a few quarters, maybe two to
three quarters and then we expect it to come down. That's all subject to kind of the macro environment, obviously.
But in terms of what we're seeing today, that's the expectation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just on the sales volumes, I know they were pretty flattish this quarter. Just wondering, under the hood,
what's going on there? Is this representative of maybe more of a slower growth in new accounts is maybe your
same-store customer still growing at a faster pace year-over-year. And then just maybe thinking through the
dynamic of faster network volumes, faster debit volumes, anything going on there that's driving your debit and
network volumes to reaccelerate versus your proprietary card volumes as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, let me start with sales. So, what we're seeing is a downward trend in sales. So, if you go back to the
fourth quarter of 2023, we're at about 10% year-over-year growth. First quarter was 8%, 2.5% in the second
quarter, and about 1% here in the third quarter and through mid-October, about 1%. Interestingly enough, the
dynamics are changing in terms of categories.
So, online spend is up at around 4% to 5%. Every day spend is up about 3%. That's largely inflation-driven, we
believe. And discretionary is flat to down with the exception of entertainment expense or entertainment-related
11

categories, which is up north of 20%, which is hard for me to understand at this point. But we're trying to dig into
the details.
In terms of implications for next year, we're going to assume a relatively modest sales growth, maybe slow in the
lower single digits. The transactor revolver components of that, I mentioned that already, so more pullback on the
revolver base.
The other piece of your question is debit transactions. We've had great execution from our PULSE business. So,
we've expanded a number of contractual arrangements and also debit choice routing has actually made a
difference in the volumes. So, our PULSE team is executing well and appears to be capturing some share.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. Hey, look, you've cited a couple of things that are driving the
increase in delinquencies. You've talked about seasoning of vintage. You've talked about some exposure to lower
FICO scores within the cohorts. At the same time, you guys are staring to apply a lot more machine learning to
your portfolio and your process.
I'm curious if you're identifying other factors that are contributing to the increase in delinquencies, whether it's age
demographic, geography, what might be other factors that are contributing to this in the context of strong labor
markets And then, the follow-up to that is, with that information, can you then apply different servicing strategies
to enhance that performance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. You're into the secret sauce of underwriting, Rick. But I'll give you a little bit of overview. So, we spent a lot
of time trying to revive – to update our models. And we looked at, no exaggeration, probably 300 different risk
identifiers or risk letters. And what we did find is savings rate is important, household net worth is important, the
amount of credit on us. So, on the credit report and Discover's balance sheet as well as the amount of credit off
are – continue to be really, really important.
And then also, there's some work being done on cash flow underwriting because of some of the off-bureau credit
that we experienced or the whole market experienced in 2021 and 2022. So, we're going to continue to look to
refine our models and see what we can do to identify accounts that are going to be highly profitable and originate
those.

In terms of the second part of your question around servicing strategies, there's been a lot of work done on best
time to contact, and we've got some machine learning models that are focused on that as well as best channel to
contact. So, is it via phone, e-mail, text or other means? All that work is ongoing. And frankly, it'll never stop. It will
be a continued refinement of the model so that we can collect effectively and originate profitably.

Got it. Hey, John, it's very interesting and very helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your
line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. To start, I wanted to actually ask about personal loans.
You're continuing to see some very healthy growth there. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the drivers?
I think I know you mentioned a little bit of payment rate pullback, but what about from a competition standpoint?
What's driving that?
And then, just related to that, to the comments you've been making about on the credit card side, wanted to
understand if you're seeing any meaningful deterioration in credit there. Anything on the vintage – do the vintage
comments apply here? Anything like we should be thinking about there? Are you tightening underwriting currently
in that personal loan space, too? Yeah, thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So, our average ticket on a personal loan is significantly larger than many of our
competitors. And the predominant share of the volume now is for debt consolidation efforts and important to
recognize that as part of our underwriting process, when there's a debt consolidation customer, somewhere
between 70% to 80% of the disbursement goes to the creditors to ensure that the overall cost of debt for that
customer is lowered and therefore, their ability to pay as high. So that's an important distinction.
In terms of growth, what we've seen is high level of demand, but also a reduction in the payment rate. And that
reduction in the payment rate has also been responsible for a very significant chunk of the growth that we've seen
in the quarter.
In terms of kind of the performance there, it is what I'll say, returning to more historical performance metrics, but
again, highly profitable and you can see from the report or from the details in terms of delinquency rates that
remain very, very low relative to historical standards.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe if I could just turn back a little for a second to the compliance issue
question and the timing, et cetera. It sounds like from what you're saying related to the merchant mispricing issue,
the outside law firm has completed the investigation. You've discussed results with regulators already. So I think
what a lot of people are just trying to understand is what needs to happen for the buybacks to resume. I
understand it's difficult to put a specific date out there, but is the overall message, it's going to take several
13

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
quarters for those to resume? Maybe just help us understand what needs to happen here for you to get
comfortable? And again, like I understand, you don't want to put a specific timeframe, but is the right message
that it's going to be several quarters more? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, no specific timing on the resumption. So what we want to do is have further dialogue with our
merchants to ensure we're progressing the remediation and negotiations. We also continue to have discussions
with our regulatory agencies. And we're looking to progress those and we're also reviewing our capital positions,
right? There's a number of pulls on capital this year. Certainly, the phenomenal loan growth that we've seen.
We've got Basel Endgame that's on the horizon. We have the CECL Phase-In also impacting capital levels. So
we're going to take a look at the profitability for 2024, take a look at the progress we're making on the card tiering
issue and overall risk in governance items and make a recommendation to the board.
So I'll say my key summary here is that our capital priorities haven't changed. We're focused on generating
positive earnings to be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. Our margin rates
remain robust. Our return on equity this quarter and for the year remains really, really strong. So, it's a matter of
just making sure we've got the right balance between investing and return of capital.

Mihir Bhatia Q

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Follow-up on return on equity. One of the questions we get I mean, obviously, Discover's reported
very strong ROE for very long time with the changes in regulations and potential capital changes. What are your
thoughts on Discover being able to generate the types of return on equity that we've seen over the last 15 years
or so?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Certainly, relative to kind of history and then going forward, a couple of important points. So we have
operated with capital well above our operating target for the better part of, I don't know, at least as long as I've
been here four years now, and we are approaching the 10.5% target. I will say that our overall capital position
does remain very, very strong, right? So regulatory minimums, 4.5%, SCB 2.5%, so the required capital 7%, and
we're at 11.6% here on CET1 for the quarter.
So, my expectation is we're going to manage the business to continue to generate high returns and deliver a high
level of return on equity overall and being able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders.
So, as we go out three to five years, it's a bit challenging to predict a regulatory regime and the expectations for
institutions such as ours in terms of overall capital levels. But we're well positioned to generate positive capital
and return capital.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just on the overall, the long-term growth of your business, your core
customer, the TAM of your business and the ability for Discover to grow, I mean, I think historically, high single-
digit kind of loan growth is – and spending growth. What are your thoughts – is the ability to grow those types of
rates what we should continue to expect? And how does the cash back debit product maybe affect that growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I mean, certainly, our expectation is to continue to grow at least in line with kind of historical norms. The
cashback debit product, we actually think has a lot of power behind it. So the features of the product itself are
super, right? So 1% cash back on debit transactions, we have a positive kind of business impact from our ability
to capture interchange on those transactions. So that's positive. And then it's a whole new customer outlet for us.
So executed well, it will bring in a new cohort of customers that we can then underwrite and cross-sell to further
help the customer experience in terms of meeting additional banking needs and turn that checking product into a
credit card relationship or perhaps a personal loan down the road. So we're super excited about it.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending on tech, in particular, in the info processing line. Could you
provide a little more detail on some of the projects that you have in place and whether you expect those to be
ongoing, or are there additional projects that you anticipate, particularly around tech investment and other
investments that you're making within the franchise? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So we're a digital institution. So the first piece is we're going to continue to invest in tech and advanced
analytics to kind of help their customer experience and then also help us to generate positive returns. Some of the
specific projects that we're working on. So we've got a number of advanced analytics programs around collections
and around originations in order to be able to service the customer as well and then target the right sort of
customers. We also did a bunch of work last year and into this year in terms of improving the closure rate of leads
from a lead into a funded customer, whether it was a savings or credit customer.
This year, we're investing heavily in our risk and compliance systems. So certainly, there's tech spend going on
there. We also have tech spend related to our on-prem servers and moving to a hybrid and cloud environment.
That's certainly a significant spend. And then also, given the risk and compliance issues that we've seen
historically, we're spending a lot of time taking a look at how our core systems work, the data that goes in and the
data that comes out and what we do with the data and looking to kind of reduce the amount of manual touches to
that data. So all of that is part of the reason or the reasons why we're seeing kind of information processing and
tech spend overall increase this year?

John B. Owen A
Director, Interim Chief Executive Officer & President, Discover Financial Services
Two other areas I would call out. Around our fraud detection, we continue to invest heavily in our fraud detection.
That's ongoing battle every quarter, but we've made significant investments in fraud and continue to push on that
area. The second thing around our digital capabilities as a digital bank, we've got a very easy-to-use system, easy
application process, very easy for customers to open up our cash back debit, as we spent a lot of time and effort
in customer flows and customer engagement and how we onboard customers in a more seamless manner.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for all that detail. And just a follow-up on your investment on enhancing recovery rates. Have you seen
any particular shift in the recovery rates you have today? Or where they're trending relative to past cycles?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
No specific changes to recovery rates. We are seeing more customers seek credit assistance and negotiate
settlements. There seems to be a cottage industry developing around that. And that's back in – I think it was the
month of July, we saw a chunk of charge-offs come through as a result of settlements from these institutions. But
overall, recovery rates remain strong. The pool of charge-offs to be able to capture recoveries from obviously is
increasing as the charge-offs increase. So, that's actually part of our – how we take a look at overall credit and
reserving.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Holowko Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking our questions. Most of them have been answered, but just
wanted to follow-up with one question on loan growth. So, obviously, card growth remains really robust and you
raised your guidance to mid-teens for the year. And I'm just wondering, given the comments on the stress in the
lower and mid FICO scores and then the delinquency trends and then your comments that the revolve rate has
really normalized. I'm wondering if you can help us with which parts of the FICO band in your portfolio are driving
the loan growth and whether you're seeing any outsized contribution from those on the lower end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, what we're seeing is kind of loan build driven by two factors. So, it's somewhere between 30% and
40% of the build is – or the loan growth is from new accounts. And then, the remainder is coming from payment
16

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
rate normalization. So, we're seeing kind of portfolio of customers increasing their balances. And that
normalization of payment rate is pretty consistent on the upper bands, call it, the midpoint to the top two-thirds of
the portfolio. The bottom third, the payment rate normalized last year. And we're seeing that at pretty close to
historical levels, maybe a mild deterioration from that.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey, thanks so much. Something sort of related to that. So, if we just think about the year-over-year spending
growth roughly 1%, I guess what was the year-over-year growth in the number of cards or new accounts? And
also, what was the – and just added to that, what is the benefit that Discover saw to spending in the quarter
related to gas on the growth? And then, I just have a follow-up. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we grew – and we made public comments on this. In 2022, we grew accounts about 20% overall, this
year, as we've taken a look at kind of the credit performance, we're on pace to kind of originate about the same
number of overall accounts. So, the growth in terms of new accounts will be relatively flat, but the new account
generation will be pretty consistent year-over-year. That could change if we pare back credit here in the fourth
quarter and into next year.
In terms of gas, that was interesting. So, gas was up 1% in the quarter. It was also 5% category. So, when you
adjust for kind of the deflationary impact, the usage there was – or at least through our card, was up over 10%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Great. And then, obviously, you have a lot of student loans. You're one of the major players. We have the
moratorium ending. I know that that doesn't affect you directly, perhaps in your own loans because they're private
loans. But what are you seeing in the data that you're watching of how this might be affecting either payment rates
or demand for private loans or refinancings, anything you can provide as far as how this affects the consumer that
you're seeing in your data, only in 19 days or whatever, but anything you can provide would be really helpful.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, we're not seeing anything in our data yet, whatsoever. We did actually, a couple of quarters ago,
quantify what we thought the impact could be to our portfolio in terms of charge-offs. And as it turns out based on
the executive order direction in terms of kind of the repayment structure that Biden administration is putting in
place and making kind of payment levels associated or tied to income levels. We expect the impact on our
portfolio to be de minimis.

Now, we'll see how it all plays out legislatively, but we're not expecting a significant impact certainly this year. And
we'll evaluate to see what happens and take a look at our data to make a determination if it is going to have an
adverse impact on our charge-offs, but today, nothing.
