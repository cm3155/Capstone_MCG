Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analyst Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings Plc's Earnings Release for 3Q 2021. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At
this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Good morning or afternoon wherever you are. Ewen is going to take the bulk of the call today and he
will do that in future Q1 and Q3 announcements. For today, though, let me start by saying that I'm really pleased
with our third quarter performance. We've had a strong quarter of profit generation across all regions, supported
by another quarter of net ECL releases, but most pleasing is the underlying revenue growth we're now seeing
across the business. We feel that we're turning the corner on revenue, after absorbing interest rate impacts over
the last few quarters. We've got strong fee growth in all businesses.
[audio gap] (00:01:03-00:01:24)
In Global Banking and Markets, revenue is starting to stabilize and that's against the backdrop of a large
managed reduction in risk-weighted assets and lending balances as we indicated back in February 2020. In terms
of customer behavior, we're seeing a strong deposit performance without any material drawdown on the liquidity
that we've built up over the last two years. The lending market was softer than we anticipated in the quarter,
particularly in corporate loans, but the pipelines that we built up position us well for when companies start
investing in both the recovery and the low carbon transition. On capital, as our revenue starts to normalize, we've
also looked to normalize our capital position. Capital returns to shareholders will be a big component of this and
I'm pleased to announce a share buyback of $2 billion which we expect to start shortly.
On our strategy, we're executing with exactly the kind of pace I promised in February. We've made some
important announcements in the quarter, including the acquisition of AXA Singapore. This complements our
existing Singapore business very well and accelerates the build-out of our product and distribution capabilities in
one of the world's most important wealth markets.
Pre-COP26, we've been working incredibly hard with clients, governments and our industry peers on accelerating
the low carbon transition. We're working with a range of partners to find new ways to open the sustainable finance
market for projects and investors. A fortnight ago, we announced a pioneering partnership with Temasek to create
the debt financing platform for sustainable infrastructure in Southeast Asia, which I believe provides an important
model for others to follow. This is just one of a number of sustainability partnerships that we hope to announce in
the coming weeks. And I look forward to updating you on those shortly.
In terms of the financial industry's contribution, the task force of international banks that I've been privileged to
chair over the recent months just released a guide for banks on setting and delivering net zero targets. This is an
unprecedented collaboration that makes an important contribution to help all banks operationalize the targets
they've set and importantly, to bring consistency and coherence for our customers, regulators and investors.
I'm really excited about the months ahead. There's real dynamism and optimism within the business. And we're
focused on delivering growth in the areas we've targeted. With the added benefit of interest rate rises on the
horizon, we're in a strong position moving into 2022.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
With that, I'll hand over to Ewen to take you through the detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. We had another good quarter. Reported pre-tax profits of $5.4
billion, up 76% on last year's third quarter with an annualized return on tangible equity of 9.1% for the year to
date. Adjusted revenues were down 1% on last year's third quarter, but up 1% excluding certain volatile items with
a welcome return to more consistent top line growth across most of our business lines. Expected credit losses
were a $659 million net release by third quarter in a row of net releases with net releases for the year to date of
some $1.4 billion. We still retain 31% of stage 1 and stage 2 ECL reserve build-out we made in 2020.
Operating expenses were broadly stable. Increases in investment and technology spend were offset by the
impact of our cost saving initiatives. But due to some inflationary pressures, ongoing investment into growth and
additional costs due to the impact and timing of recently announced M&A activity, we now expect our adjusted
costs for 2021 and 2022 to remain broadly stable at around $32 billion, excluding the UK bank levy.
Lending balances were down by $6 billion or 1%. This was due to the repayment of $14 billion of short-term IPO
lending in Hong Kong. Stripping out the impact of the IPO loans, lending grew by $8 billion or 3% annualized
during the quarter, with further good growth in mortgage lending and trade finance. Our Core Tier 1 ratio was up
30 basis points at 15.9%, primarily due to a reduction in risk-weighted assets. We now intend to reach our target
for Core Tier 1 of 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. This will reflect a combination of some regulatory-driven
RWA impacts, balance sheet growth and capital return. Today's $2 billion buyback announcement is part of this
commitment to accelerate the normalization of our Core Tier 1 position. Our tangible net asset value per share of
$7.81 was unchanged on the second quarter.
Turning to slide 4. We're seeing good signs of growth returning across our global businesses. In Wealth and
Personal Banking, we've continued to grow Asian net new money in Private Banking and Asset Management.
We've increased the value of new business and insurance by 59% year-on-year. We've hired 450 new Wealth
Planners in Pinnacle, our new Chinese insurance venture.
We've kept our UK flow market share comfortably above our stock share and we've made good progress on new
customer acquisition. In Commercial Banking, we're seeing encouraging trends in global trade, with good market
share growth in key markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore and we've maintained a strong business pipeline
with $64 billion of new approved limits.
In Global Banking and Markets, we saw more stable revenue compared to a strong performance in the third
quarter last year with good revenue growth in both security services and equities. And GB&M's performance was
achieved despite a 7% reduction in risk-weighted assets year on year. Looking geographically, in Asia, we're
seeing strong underlying revenue trends. Excluding insurance market impacts, revenues were up 7% quarter-on-
quarter and 5% year-on-year. And in the UK ring-fenced bank, revenues were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and 6%
year-on-year, with fee income up 25% over the third quarter last year.
Finally and importantly, we're delivering on our goal to be a leader in the transition to net zero. We have issue
$170 billion of green bonds year-to-date, including leading on a number of pioneering green bond offerings such
as the first UK Green Gilt and we're making good progress against the commitments we made in our AGM
Special Resolution in May.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Turning to slide 5 and looking at third quarter adjusted revenues as a whole. In Wealth and Personal Banking,
headline revenues were down 3% on a year ago, but excluding insurance market impacts, Wealth Management
revenues grew by $145 million or 7%. This was mainly due to higher fee income in Asset Management and
Private Banking, together with insurance sales growth. Personal Banking revenues fell by $31 million due to the
continuing impact of low interest rates on deposit margins.
Commercial Banking revenues were 4% higher, driven by higher fee income across all products and growth in
trade lending and deposit balances. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 3%.This was due to
slower customer activity in fixed income markets versus a strong third quarter last year. However, Equities
benefited from both higher client activity and volatility in Asia, and Security Services grew through higher fee
income and assets under custody.
Slide 6 shows the revenue trend quarter-on-quarter with growth in all three global businesses, excluding
insurance market impacts. This has been driven by a combination of more stable net interest income, together
with good fee income growth across all our businesses, up 10% year-on-year. We are increasingly confident that
we're turning the corner on revenue growth. Commercial Banking is growing, Wealth and Personal Banking is
growing in Wealth Management and stabilizing in Retail Banking. And Global Banking and Markets is close to that
inflection point now that the bulk of its planned RWA reductions in the business are now complete.
With the expectation of policy rates from 2022 onwards, we're now confident in seeing sustained revenue growth
this coming year and beyond, which together with strong cost control will help drive a sustained improvement in
core returns and operating jaws.
On slide 7, net interest income was $6.6 billion, up 2% against the third quarter of 2020 on a reported basis and
broadly stable compared with the second quarter of 2021. On rates, the net interest margin was 119 basis points,
down 1 basis point on the second quarter, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix and continued
weakness in Ibor. Lending volumes were down on the quarter, but excluding the repayment of IPO loans, lending
grew by $8 billion, with continued good loan growth in mortgages in Hong Kong and the UK, together with the
ongoing growth in our global trade franchise. For 2022, with our net interest margin stabilizing, policy rate rises on
the horizon and loan growth building, we're increasingly confident on the outlook for net interest income.
On the next slide, we reported a net release of $659 million of ECLs in the quarter compared with an $823 million
charge in the third quarter of 2020. The net release was across all our global businesses, reflecting a more stable
economic outlook together with stage 3 charges that remained very low. Despite the net releases, we continue to
retain a conservative outlook on risk. We still hold $1.2 billion or 31% of our 2020 COVID-19 uplift to stage 1 and
2 ECL reserves.
For the full year, we now expect net releases to be broadly in line with the net release in the first nine months,
with perhaps a very modest net release in the fourth quarter after stage 3 charges. For 2022, we continue to
expect the ECL charge for the full year to be lower than our medium-term through-the-cycle planning range of 30
to 40 basis points, with more modest ECL releases expected to continue into the first half of 2022, albeit with an
expected net charge after stage 3 impairments.
Turning to slide 9, third quarter adjusted operating costs were broadly stable on the same period of last year, a
$263 million increase in technology spending and a $340 million increase in investment and other costs were
offset by a further $600 million of cost program savings compared with the prior year, with an associated cost to
achieve of $400 million.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
To date, our cost programs have achieved savings of $2.6 billion relative to our end 2022 target of at least $5
billion in cost savings. And cumulative cost to achieve spend to date has been $3.1 billion with an intention to still
spend $7 billion through the end of 2022.
In terms of outlook, with some inflationary and performance-related pay pressures, ongoing investment spend and
additional cost due to the impact and timing of recently announced acquisitions and disposals, we now expect
2021 and 2022 adjusted costs, excluding the UK bank levy to be around $32 billion. This is relative to our
previous FX adjusted guidance of $31.3 billion for 2022, which included the bank levy.
Turning to capital on slide 10, our core tier 1 ratio was 15.9%, up 30 basis points in the quarter. This reflected a
decrease in risk weighted assets from lower short-term lending, favorable asset quality movements and FX,
partially offset by a decrease in CET1 including around $1.7 billion for foreseeable dividends. Excluding FX
movements, risk-weighted assets fell by $14.4 billion in the third quarter, driven by lower short-term IPO loan
exposures in Hong Kong and positive movements in asset quality.
In the third quarter, we made a regulatory deduction of 20 basis points for all foreseeable dividends in the quarter.
This was based on 47.5% of our third quarter EPS of $0.18, which is the midpoint of our 40% to 55% target
payout ratio. The dividend accrual for 2021 so far is $3.8 billion after payment of the $0.07 per share interim
dividend. Please remember that this is not guidance of our full-year 2021 dividend intentions, the dividend accrual
is purely a formulaic calculation that [ph] will true up (00:16:51) at the full year based upon the results and outlook
at the time.
When thinking about the payout ratio for 2021, we'll attach a much lower weight to unusually low ECLs as part of
our EPS this year, together with a desire to see higher dividends per share in 2022 relative to 2021.We intend to
normalize our core tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters to be back within our 14% to 14.5% target range by the
end of 2022, driven by a combination of balance sheet growth, capital returns and regulatory impacts. Various
things to note for your capital modeling through the end of 2022. We expect today's buyback announcement, the
loss on sale of our French Retail Banking operations and the reversal of the current software capitalization benefit
to each impact our core tier 1 ratio by around 25 basis points. And we also expect some $20 billion to $35 billion
of regulatory durée on RWA uplifts in 2022.
So, in summary, this was another good quarter, good earnings diversity across the group, a broad-based return to
top line growth in most of our businesses and continued strong control on costs. While the results were flatted by
net ECL releases, we're happy to be turning the corner on revenue with robust lending platforms, growth in trade
and mortgage balances and the likelihood of really a pipeline rate rises than previously anticipated. We're
increasingly confident on the revenue growth outlook for 2022.
We've included a few IFRS 17 slides in the appendix. We intend to go through this in more detail on our follow-up
call on Wednesday for sell-side analysts. Overall, we expect an initial downside adjustment to our insurance
profits of around two-thirds and a smaller percentage adjustment to insurance's tangible equity.
Importantly, there will be no significant impact on the group's regulatory capital and there'll be no impact on the
dividend flows from our insurance businesses to the group. Despite inflationary cost pressures and the impact of
IFRS 17 implementation, we remain confident in achieving returns at or above our cost of capital over the next
three years together with delivering attractive growth and attractive capital returns. Finally, we're looking to
normalize our Core Tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters, of which today's buyback announcement is an important
first step.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
With that, Sharon, if we could please open up for questions?
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of
Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Start with one on the buybacks and then one on costs. So, when you
come out and quantify the $2 billion plus buyback, can you just go to the metrics that you're using to size that?
How you're thinking about this buyback through say buybacks going forward and basically the KPIs in your
decision making process on the magnitude of those? So that will be the first question.
The second question is on the cost outlook where you've slightly changed your guidance and also the definition
you're using. I think [ph] based on your old guidance is that's one in the half, (00:20:56) and then adjusting to the
levy, it looks like you've taken out the cost guidance by about $800 million. So can you just give a breakdown of
what the moving parts are in the increase? How much of it is due to the timing around the M&A and divestments
versus how much is inflationary pressures and how much is higher compensation related to performance-related
pay? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, back on – on buybacks, Andy, as you would expect, it's [indiscernible] (00:21:29). Yeah, we – our
capital position is obviously in a much better place than we had anticipated at the start of the year when we had
said no buybacks for this year. We've had a combination of much higher profitability than we expected because of
lower – much lower ECLs, net releases and [ph] slower (00:21:55) cost to achieve being expensed through the
P&L. And risk weighted assets have also been lower than we anticipated partly because of lower growth but also
because of lower credit rating migration. I think within today's announcement is a commitment to get back to 14%
to 14.5% by the end of 2022. Yeah, we are committed to using excess capital if we can't find attractive organic
and inorganic growth opportunities.
We previously talked on inorganic about wanting to spend up to $2 billion in M&A. We've announced a deal in
Singapore, AXA Singapore for just over $500 million. So, that will give you some color of the extent of M&A
activity that you might see over the next year or so. I do think that we are likely to see if we achieve what we think
we'll achieve next year, some further buyback activity in 2022.
On costs, yeah, I think your numbers are broadly right. If you add about $300 million for M&A [ph] in terms of sort
of (00:23:18) roughly $0.5 billion and upwards pure cost, the bulk of that is compensation related and you're right,
part of it is variable pay, but I would sort of put it all in the bucket of compensation cost being higher. Broadly, our
total wage bill is about $19 billion out of the $32 billion of total costs. Yeah, so if you've got $0.5 billion of

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
incremental inflation on that, it's about two – it's about $0.5 billion – 2.5%, so about $0.5 billion of extra
compensation cost.
Yeah, whether you put it into fixed pay or variable pay, I think we are seeing sustained wage price pressure
globally at the moment. But in terms of the incremental amount that we've put into the variable pay pool this year,
it's significantly more than offset by the increase in profitability that we've seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think if I could just add a comment there. To the extent that we've topped up variable pay, it's probably because
we've had a good trading performance this year. And clearly we've given some indications on our view of trading
performance next year being positive. And it would be right to have an appropriate level of variable pay at that
point in time. In the event that that trading performance actually does materialize, then we have some flexibility on
the variable pay. But it's right to also signal that there is some fixed pay inflation pressures in the market generally
within financial services at this point in time. So the extra top up on costs is a combination of fixed pay and
variable pay as a consequence of the external environment and the trading performance of the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah and I think the last thing Noel also that's important is we've made a very conscious decision not to cut back
on investment despite that inflationary pressure in order to meet a self-imposed cost target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global
Markets Ltd.
That's great. Thank you both. And also thank you [indiscernible] (00:25:37) the slides on IFRS 17 as well. Thank
you.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tom Rayner from Numis. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yes. Good. Thank you. Hi, there Noel. Hi, Ewen. Two please. Just a quick follow-up on costs and then one on
revenue. You mentioned Ewen about $300 million of the increased guidance is M&A related. Can you give us a
sort of estimate of how much that M&A activity might add to the revenue over the sort of next two to three years,
just to get a sense? And then, just on revenue. You're clearly more positive on the revenue outlook and you've
flagged a number of areas. You didn't really comment I don't think on the outlook for the net interest margin. I look
at your consensus and it only has an increase from Q3 right out to the end of 2020, say, of about 7 basis points.
And if I just take your own rate sensitivity and sort of multiply it by what's in – being discounted by the market, it
will obviously be a multiple of 7 basis points. I wonder if you could comment on the outlook for NIM specifically,
please? Thank you.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks. So, on costs, look, in the near term I think AXA Singapore will add about $300 million to revenues and
$300 million to costs. Obviously, we would expect that picture to move over time. But if you plug in $300 million
into 2022 on the revenue side. On NIM [indiscernible] (00:27:22) forecast, but if you looked at current consensus,
if you – yeah, it does look low relative to the consensus policy rate rises that you now see in the markets. Just as
a reminder, our biggest single sensitivity is the UK where a 25basispoint rise would add about $0.5 billion of
income in the first year.
And, secondly, Hong Kong, and it does look like in the UK, we will see two, three rate rises between now and the
end of 2022 coming potentially as early as the next month or so. Hong Kong may be a bit slower, but one of the
offsets to – clear offsets to the guidance we're giving on cost today is the fact that we do think we're going to see
earlier and stronger rate rises than we previously anticipated. We lost about $7 billion over the last year – two
years or so as a result of the shift down on interest rates. So, it's had a very, very material impact on us and we
do think with the policy rate outlook at the moment and consensus that we should start to claw back a meaningful
amount of that in the next two to three years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
[indiscernible] (00:28:46). Okay. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you. Morning, afternoon, Noel, Ewen. Couple of questions from my side. Maybe, firstly, just staying on the
revenue line, I just wanted to understand the pandemic impacts that's still washing through your various
businesses and sort of holding back your revenue line. So, I was wondering if you could comment on the Wealth
business in Hong Kong. With – in light of all the travel restrictions, how you think the performance in this quarter
has been held back and how that might shift over the next year or so? And also in trade, obviously you flagged a
very strong improvement in trade balances. There is a lot of uncertainty around clearly what's happening in global
trade, so any thoughts on the outlook that would be helpful?
And then just a broader second question on China real estate, thank you for the disclosure. I think we all get sort
of your first order impacts and exposures are relatively limited, but I was wondering what you think about the
second order impacts on your business in the Mainland just given defaults have spread beyond sort of single
name into quite a few developers now. So how do you see that impacting the rest of your book and the rest of
your business [indiscernible] (00:30:14)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, maybe I'll start off and then, Noel, you can add some comments then on trade and commercial real
estate after I finish. Look, on Hong Kong and the border being shut, the – I mean you can see some direct
impacts on things like insurance franchise. We're not as exposed obviously to others like Pru and AIA to the

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Mainland Chinese insurance market, but it is a meaningful kicker to the performance of our insurance franchise in
Hong Kong. Having said that, I think the value of new business in Q3 was in line with Q3 pre-pandemic.
You can see certain sectors in Hong Kong continuing to suffer. Yeah, the biggest border is the Hong Kong-
Mainland China border rather than the international border for Hong Kong, given the pre-pandemic about 50
million Mainland Chinese were visiting Hong Kong in any given year. So, we would expect as that border
progressively reopens, and it's been much slower than we would have anticipated six or nine months ago, that we
will just see an incremental benefit coming through to the Hong Kong business.
On trade, despite supply chain disruptions, I think we're pretty pleased with the recovery that we're seeing in that
business. People are holding higher working capital balances at the moment, consistent with the uncertainty that
exists in the supply chains. But, yeah, we do view that as a temporary feature of the global economy at the
moment and that we will get back to more normality and more sustained growth in 2022.
On the China real estate market, I mean, we've just been through, as you would expect, a pretty intensive review
of our Chinese real estate exposure including the provisioning we brought against it. Just to repeat what we said
today, we've got no direct exposure to redlist borrowers, we're pretty comfortable with the exposure overall. In
aggregate, commercial real estate – our commercial real estate in China is less than $20 billion in the context of a
$1 trillion loan portfolio. And I think the other thing you should read in Raul is the fact that we're doing a buyback
today and the size that we're doing it is that we're reasonably confident about where we're sitting in terms of our
outlook. But Noel, I don't know whether you want to add anything or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just ironically on trade, there's a feature, the more uncertain global economics are, is normally the time when
trade finance is in demand because of uncertainty over the supply chain, uncertainty over credit environment. So
we've seen strong growth in trade balances. Part of that is a function of economic rebound. Part of that, I think, is
a function of working capital cycles are longer today than they were pre-COVID and pre-pandemic because of the
tensions in the supply chain, and the bottlenecks. And part of that is people tend to use documentary credit more
in uncertain times than open account, and therefore they turn more to the financial services sector to finance
trade in a structured manner rather than financing trade in an unstructured open account methodology.
So, I think there's a number of reasons. And then the fourth ingredient is, frankly, we are taking market share in
trade in Asia in particular, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore. So, those four dynamics, I think, are leading
to very strong double-digit growth in trade. And I think if you look at our trade balances from the end of last year to
the end of September, we're up around about 18%, 20%. If you do a year-on-year comparison, September to
September, I think we maybe mid-20% growth in trade, particularly in Asia. So, it's those four factors, I think, are
playing into the trade performance.
And on China, the only other comment I'd make is, look, there is second order risk in – whenever there's a market
adjustment of that size taking place in a particular industry sector, and particularly one as important as
commercial real estate. I think we're pretty comfortable with our position and we're staying very close to any
potential second order risks. But I'll reinforce what Ewen said, we feel comfortable with our position in our bank in
China. It's performing well. It's had a good nine months. And we're well positioned on commercial real estate from
a primary risk point of view and we think we're well-positioned on any second order risk. But I'd be foolish if I said
there was no second order risk. It potentially exists for all of us.

Thank you, Noel. Can I just follow up on the trade margin? I don't know if you've seen a sort of shift in the trade
margin within the business and if you expect that to shift going forward given what we're seeing in terms of the
global trade picture. Thanks.

Hi, Manus.

Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. I just wanted to follow up actually on those questions about the, hopefully, post-pandemic reopening. You
gave us some data in the second quarter about credit card balances growing, but I haven't seen it so far this
quarter. I wonder if you could talk to us about what you're seeing in unsecured? And you mentioned within the
NIM that there was a negative mix shift which hurt the NIM. At what point will that mix shift change, so as
unsecured consumer starts to grow, presumably, you'd start to see a positive benefit? Any color you could provide
around that will be appreciated. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. [ph] I mean, (00:37:04) firstly on NIM, two things were going on, I think, to sort of push it down by 1 basis
point in the quarter. Firstly was HIBOR drifted down by a couple of basis points over the quarter. We do hope
we're now at the trough of that. And there is a mix shift with both the higher propensity of mortgage – lower
spread mortgage lending and the fact that we're continuing to increase our liquidity reserves at the moment.
Yeah, the unsecured was probably up about $1 billion underlying in the quarter for both across Hong Kong and
UK, and about half and half across the two markets. Yeah, what we are seeing is credit card spending come back

up closer to the pre-pandemic levels, but what we're not seeing yet are the balances go up in line with that. I think
that will – yeah, should happen over time.
But at the moment, whether it's Commercial customers or Personal customers, we're seeing the same thing. In
UK mortgages, for example, people are paying down debt when they can. And I think that's just a sign of
confidence at the moment that we would expect to continue to improve as we continue to move away from the
depths of COVID.

Ya Fei Tian Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.
Thank you. I have a question around revenue. You give us color that's quite a lot of the optimism is coming from
the higher expected interest rate in some of your markets. Besides that interest rate shift, are there any organic
growth that HSBC is gaining market share that you think that [ph] we're – the sell side (00:39:02) is missing that
could drive more consensus revenue upgrades and some non-interest income? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean to be clear we're not reliant on interest rate rises to underpin the business plan that we've got. The
– we're seeing – with NIM stabilizing, we're probably going to see about 3% loan growth this year. We would
expect mid-single-digit loan growth next year. So, you would expect a healthy increase in net interest income next
year with or without rate rises. We're seeing very good growth in fee income as we come out of COVID. I think it's
up 10% year-on-year. So, yeah, the core business at the moment is seeing very good, attractive growth. Interest
rate rises will just come on top of that.
And in terms of where we're growing, look, Noel said earlier we're taking share in trade. We're up a couple of
percentage points of share over the last year, both in Hong Kong and Singapore. We're continuing to grow UK
mortgage share above stock share. I think we were sort of about 1% ahead of stock share in the quarter. Yeah,
we're growing the Private Bank I think ahead of peers, particularly Credit Suisse in Asia at the moment. So, yeah,
most of our businesses I think are flat to gaining share.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking questions. The first one was back on costs and one on RWA. So, on costs
and Ewen, you briefly alluded for the previous question, the link with the interest rate outlook. I mean how much is
the new guidance intertwined with market inflation and interest rate expectations? Or to put it another way, policy
rates don't move higher in line with market expectations. Should we expect you to come in lower than that
guidance? And then the second question on RWAs, consensus is nearly $70 billion higher by the end of next year
than where we sit today. Appreciate there are some regulatory headwinds on the horizon that you flagged and
you've now delivered a majority of the gross RWAs, as you've guided to, by the end of next year. But the market
RWA expectations, I guess $9 billion or $7 billion next year look a little too conservative given the starting point
and what you're seeing currently in terms of lack of credit migration? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, on cost, yeah, they are connected, but not a direct line between the inflationary pressure that we're
seeing coming through the cost structure and the fact that we expect to see earlier policy rate rises. To give
everyone assurance, we are actively managing our cost base in line with what we previously thought. We're still
committed to taking out $5 billion of costs over the period to the end of 2022 and we've done just over half of that
so far.
But on a $19 billion wage bill, look, if you see each percentage point is another $190 million of cost relative to
where we were at the start of the year, we're definitely seeing more inflation. The offset for that should be policy
rate rises coming earlier and stronger. And if they do, that will comfortably offset the inflationary pressure we're
seeing on costs.
But we are not going soft on costs just because we think that there is a potential of rate rises. That's not how
we're operating the business. On RWAs, I mean, I think, we've given you pretty much all of the inputs to model. I
guess we're more confident on the RWA growth outlook for – lending growth outlook for next year than I think is
currently in consensus. We've got it to mid-single-digit loan growth. The other thing that we've given you the
impacts on regulatory capital, you can plug in your own numbers in terms of – we've given you our distribution
policy on dividends. So, the only things that you don't have is where the profitability is going to be next year, what
buybacks we're going to do. And even on inorganic, we've tried to give you a steer as to what the total quantum of
financial inorganic that we might do as well.

Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I've got a few questions on rate sensitivity, please. I
was hoping if you could give some color around deposit betas in your rate sensitivity disclosure, especially for the
UK and Hong Kong given one of your peers reassessed the UK rate sensitivity based on a sort of more realistic
assumption of what deposit betas are likely to be. And any color that you can give on the proportion of deposits
contractually linked to market rates in both those markets would be very helpful.

And the second part of my question on rate sensitivity is the other currencies figure of $1.5 billion. Could you
perhaps just elaborate a little bit more about what the key sensitivities in terms of different currencies are there
because it's about as big as the Hong Kong sensitivity? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes, look, on rate sensitivity, I think you should have seen for the first one or two interest rate rises that we have
relatively low deposit beta on that and that we will try to capture higher than average capture out of those rate
rises. And I think over the longer term, typically, we work on the basis of about a 40% to 50% deposit beta, but in
the very, very short term, with the first rate rise, I think it will be much lower than that. In terms of other currencies,
Indian rupee, renminbi, various emerging market currencies of which Mexico is important. I'm sure if you follow up
with the IR team, they can give you a fuller breakdown of that.

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked actually, but a couple of points of clarification. So thanks
very much for the IFRS 17 disclosure on the insurance business. In terms of the two-thirds PBT impact that you
kind of expect in 2023, I mean, I guess that insurance profit that we would be making profit, that adjustment to –
are we talking – is it around a kind of $1.5 billion hit that we should be looking for kind of reported PBT in 2023?
Any clarification there would be really helpful.
And then just a second on the cost to achieve, I know you are sticking with the guidance there at $7 billion, but it
does imply that you're going to do a lot next year. I mean, could you help us understand exactly why you've not
been able to spend it so far and kind of what you are going to be doing next year with that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. So, on PBT impacts, well $1.5 billion, it obviously depends what your forecast is. But if that's two-thirds of
the insurance profits in that year, then yes, it's probably not wildly out of line with what we think. But just again,
just to repeat on IFRS 17, there's no impact on dividend flow from the insurance companies to the group. There's

no impact on Group Core Tier 1. The timing of earnings recognition has changed. So, fundamental economics we
don't think has changed.
The other thing on tangible equity just because I know a few people have been flying around with numbers today,
we think there'll be about a $3 billion plus or minus impact to tangible equity as there was a shift and that [audio
gap] (00:48:51) then will be negative, but minimal and it's still tied in with our commitment to get back to cost of
capital returns.
On CTA, I think we'll think we'll probably spend about another $1 billion or so in Q4, which leaves us about $3
billion or so to spend in 2022. We did have a slower delivery this year. A big part of that was a lot of our change
programs are being run in India and they obviously had a pretty severe impact as a result of the pandemic, which
meant that our hiring plans, particularly technology resources that we intended to bring onboard had been slower.
So, there's been about a three-plus-month delay to some major programs of work. And it's one of the reasons
why as a result of that, we expect costs to tick up in Q4 because we've got this ramp up in investment coming into
Q4.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG
Good morning, all. Could you talk us through how interest rates are actually hedged in the various markets,
maybe just the UK, Hong Kong and US? And then so will they actually see [ph] what sort of rates it's in,
(00:50:30) do you actually [ph] need the short (00:50:31) rates to go up in all of those countries or you benefit
from higher rates in the market in some and not others?
And then secondly, just on the UK, where do you see your front book mortgage margins are at the moment and in
comparison to where they were – where they are on the back book? And what do you think recent swaps – the
increase in swaps, are they pushing rates up in the market in the UK now? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, on the hedging program, Hong Kong is very short dated, everything reprices typically in one to three months.
The UK, there is a five-year rolling hedge that we have in place, consistent with most UK peers I think with an
average duration then of about two-and-a-half years. The US is slightly longer than the five years, albeit I think
that will change once we divest ourselves out of the retail banking business. And it's not as material, obviously, as
Hong Kong and UK.
If you look at the structure of our assets and liabilities, they do tend to be much more short-dated than the
average peer, which is a combination of the impact of a short-dated nature of Hong Kong, but also on the
commercial space, our trade business is relatively short-dated as well. So, the second question was, Richard?
The second question...

Sorry. It was on front book mortgage margins versus back book and whether you think swap spreads will cause
increase in rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, front book margins are probably slightly below back book margins currently for the first time in quite a while.
We have seen some margin pressure coming through the UK mortgage franchise. We do still think, at current
rates, that we're writing business comfortably above the cost of capital, but there has been some margin
contraction.

Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Yeah. Good morning, everybody. Sorry to go on about this interest rate sensitivity, but I guess it is quite crucial in
terms of the outlook. But the bit I don't really understand is, when I look at the currencies, if I look at your year one
sensitivity, your sterling sensitivity is materially higher than your Hong Kong sensitivity, and yet your sterling is the
bit that's hedged, the Hong Kong isn't and yet the total balances in Hong Kong are, well, orders of magnitude
similar, but I guess [indiscernible] (00:53:13) slightly higher in Hong Kong than they are in sterling. So I don't – is it
possible to help us a little bit about why you have this huge sensitivity in sterling and perhaps not so much in
places like Hong Kong which are short dated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James A
Stevenson
Group Chief Financial
Officer & Director, HSBC
Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, I mean, firstly, in Hong Kong, remember that only around 50% of our deposit balances are Hong
Kong dollars. So, yeah, there is an impact of particularly US dollar book in Hong Kong I think in that interest rate
sensitivity, which with the US dollar is about 40% of – yeah, 80% of the 50% that's not Hong Kong dollars. So,
yeah, look – well, I'll need to get you a detailed answer out of our IR team if you give them a call, but [ph] assume
that (00:54:13) our interest rate sensitivity analysis is correct.

I suspect it's about the assumption. It's just – [ph] the thing we're struggling with that (00:54:21) in all areas is

ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning. Just a very quick, quick follow-up on structural hedging. One of your peers has announced its
intention to deploy structural hedging a little bit more, just changing I guess some of the assumption on the
stickiness of certain deposits. Is there scope – just based on your comments that Hong Kong is very short-dated,
40% of Hong Kong deposits are in US dollar, would there be scope to reassess some of those deposits and have
you made it similar to the UK, that deposits have a kind of [ph] – have a (00:55:23) maturity of five years and with
that, could this be a source for additional income going forward?
And secondly, on capital, I mean, first of all, thank you for the 14% to 14.5% guidance now for FY 2022. Just in
terms of thinking about the quarter one trajectory and [ph] at the end of (00:55:44) scope for capital return for
HSBC going forward over the medium term, should we use this 14%, 14.5% as a kind of a range going forward,
or is there scope for capital [ph] to achieve even lower – (00:55:55) I'm just trying to get if there's still capital
inefficiencies within the group impacting this 14% to 14.5% range. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, in terms of Hong Kong, and yeah, I mean, part of the problem, Martin, as you know, it's a very short-
dated book both on the asset and liability side. So, the choice that we have always made is not to run currency
risk to extend duration, there's probably a low hundreds of millions opportunity in the next few years through
improved management of our liquidity book. We've recently hired a few months ago the group treasurer out of
UBS to come and run our treasury business. And so I think over the next two to three years, we've probably got a
few hundred million dollars of upside in terms of how we're managing our global liquidity pool.
On capital, I would use the [ph] 14% to (00:56:56) 14.5% [ph] and (00:56:58) for the next few years, I think our
aspiration is to run it towards lower end of that range if we can. As you think further out, there's obviously the
impact of [indiscernible] (00:57:13) and what that does and depending on where they're applied and the impact on
capital positions of subsidiaries, etcetera, we're going to have to pay attention to.
To get below 14%, I think we've got a big program of work to step up our capabilities in stress testing. I think our
peak to trough fall in stress is still too high. But that will be a multiyear program of work to improve stress testing

and then go after the sort of higher risk stress areas of the bank where we're not getting remunerated
appropriately. But for the purposes of the foreseeable future, assume that 14% to 14.5% is where we're managing
to. And if we can, we'll manage through the low end of that range.

Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the cost versus benefit from rising rates. I guess you've
made the point that you haven't lightened up on investment spend. Can we just – should we therefore assume
that the 90% or so of the rate sensitivity of whatever we might assume falls through to the bottom line? I guess
what sort of quantum should we think about falls through to the bottom line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, I think the bulk of it, frankly, I mean, it depends what inflationary pressure you put on a $19 billion wage bill
on a $52 billion total cost base. But, yeah, it's relative to the previous guidance of flat cost, if you've got 1% to 2%
inflation on that. That's $300 million to $600 million of incremental costs, which I think more than gets offset by the
interest rate rises. I mean what we saw over the last year is, the bulk of that we lost, we weren't able to offset with
incremental cost savings. So I think we will keep talking – we will keep cost control tight even if we see the benefit
of rate rises coming through.

growth, organic growth in fee income, balanced growth, wealth management. So, that's good. I think more to
come on that front. We remain absolutely committed to driving out cost efficiencies, as we indicated earlier this
year. We acknowledge that there are some inflationary pressures through BP from good business performance
and from underlying inflation. But we believe that there is offsetting revenue growth to compensate for that. And
