Thank you, Myra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we review our second
quarter results which we released before the market opened this morning. Our earnings release and investor
presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
I'm extremely proud of our talented bankers who have demonstrated their unwavering commitment to each other,
our clients and communities through one of the toughest quarters in the history of banking. Because Columbia
Bank had a well-developed and tested pandemic plan at the ready, we've been able to focus on growing our
business, stand up new lending programs as part of the CARES Act and pledge $1 million to support communities
through our Pass It On and COVID-19 Community Relief campaigns.
COVID-driven changes to our operating model have resulted in minimal disruption, and I'd like to recognize that
this is in large part due to the expertise and tenacity of our business continuity and crisis management teams. The
individual that leads this team is military trained and has over 15 years of corporate business continuity

experience. Her guidance and leadership in executing on our pandemic plan has allowed the entire executive
team to remain outwardly focused on managing and growing the Bank.
The pandemic and resulting economic turmoil has magnified the focus on credit within our industry. At Columbia,
we have always taken an active approach in assisting clients through full economic cycles. While the pandemic is
beyond typical, we've experienced thinkers with thorough knowledge of our clients' businesses. We believe this
gives us a competitive advantage over most community banks. The strength of our capital position provides us
the flexibility to help our clients and communities recover from the economic effects of the pandemic. Like most
things, we are managing a surplus of liquidity. And while this has negatively affected our net interest margin, net
interest income is relatively stable even in light of the Fed's March rate cuts.
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer; and Andrew McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to
answer your questions.
Let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on
forward-looking comments, please refer to our earnings release, our website or our SEC filings.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Aaron.

Thank you, Clint. Second quarter's earnings of $36.6 million and EPS of $0.52 were an increase of $22 million
and $0.32, respectively, on a linked quarter basis. After factoring out the significant provision expense of $33.5
million, quarterly pre-tax pre-provision earnings of $78.3 million were our best quarter on record, which was $14.2
million higher than the prior record set in the second quarter of 2019 and up $18.9 million on a linked quarter
basis. The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale portion of our Visa Class B restricted stock and
subsequent write-off of the remaining shares, which together contributed $16.4 million to pre-tax income. We also
recognized an $875,000 gain on the sale of a loan that had been previously charged off.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $121.9 million, a decrease of $571,000 on a linked quarter basis.
The drop was due to the early payoff of three investment securities in the first quarter, which added $1.9 million of
non-recurring income to that earlier period. Meanwhile, second quarter interest income was negatively affected by
the full quarter impact of the March Federal Reserve rate cuts, which were largely offset by interest earned on
PPP loans. Interest expense declined significantly during the period as short-term borrowings were replaced with
lower cost deposit funding.
The net interest margin of 3.64% represented a drop of 38 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Excess liquidity
from record deposit inflows, as well as lower yields on loans and investment securities caused by the rate
environment contributed 13 basis points and 11 basis points of the decrease, respectively. The addition of lower
yielding PPP loans dropped it by 4 basis points and the margin dropped by 8 basis points due to one-time
prepayment fees in the first quarter combined with increased premium amortization in the second quarter on
investment securities. The remaining 2 basis point decline was due to balance sheet mix.
Our cost of deposits continue to be industry leading at 7 basis points, which was down 7 basis points on a linked
quarter basis and 13 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Total deposits ended the quarter at
$13.1 billion, up $2.3 billion during the quarter. Approximately 60% of this increase was concentrated in non-
interest-bearing demand deposits, which rose by $1.4 billion or 26%. At June 30, our loans totaled $9.8 billion,
3

with PPP loans accounting for about 10% of that. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 74% at quarter end. Chris will give
more color on the drivers behind those balance sheet trends in a moment.
Given the very strong deposit inflows and excess liquidity, we are starting to deploy more of the funds that we
expect much of the PPP money to be depleted over the coming months and could see other outflows as well. So,
we're taking a very cautious and incremental approach for new investments.
Non-interest income of $37.3 million was an increase of $16.1 million from the prior quarter due to the
aforementioned $16.4 million gain on Visa stock and $875,000 gain on the loan sale. This was offset by a
reduction in overdraft fees of $1.1 million. The decrease in overdraft fees is attributed to higher deposit balances
as well as lower transaction volumes due to the shelter-in-place orders.
Non-interest expense was $80.8 million in the second quarter, which was a decrease of $3.4 million on a linked
quarter basis. The change was principally due to an $8.8 million reduction in compensation and employee benefit
costs stemming mostly from the capitalization of loan origination costs from the PPP loan program. This was
partly offset by $3.6 million of systems, legal and professional, and various other costs, much of which were
incurred to respond to the pandemic and set up the PPP program. In addition, the provision for unfunded loan
commitments included in other non-interest expense increased by $1.8 million.
Our non-interest expense ratio fell to 2.13% for the quarter while our operating efficiency ratio dropped to 54.9%.
We expect our quarterly non-interest expense run rate to return to the mid-80s for the balance of the year. Our
effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.3%, which compares to 18.1% on a linked quarter basis and 19% for the
second quarter of 2019.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. It is understood that the economic challenges faced this quarter
have been extraordinary. Our bankers have responded with hundreds from all divisions and regions rallying to
ensure our clients obtain PPP funding, while at the same time, attending to loan deferral requests and the growing
of non-PPP loans and our deposit portfolio. Our bankers are dedicated to their clients' success and their efforts
have resulted in the balance sheet growth that you have seen.
As Clint mentioned, the work of our crisis management team provided us a layered approach to COVID and
allowed us to keep all of our branches and facilities open during the quarter to service our clients' needs with
minimal disruption. Additionally in the second quarter, we saw unprecedented loan and deposit growth as an
outcome of the federal economic stimulus response to the pandemic. As Aaron mentioned, deposits grew by $2.3
billion. The growth was largely due to the lower spending resulting from shelter-in-place orders as well as
proceeds from the PPP loan program.
The deposit mix shifted slightly from 58% business and 42% consumer at March 31 to 59% business and 41%
consumer at quarter's end. The exceptional build in deposits balances flowed to the asset side of the balance
sheet as well. Loans rose by $839 million during the quarter to $9.8 billion, as was mentioned. And absent PPP
loans, our portfolio declined by $103 million. C&I loans declined by $252 million, but were offset by increases in
agriculture and [ph] CRE e-loans (00:10:08) of $91 million and $63 million, respectively. Our utilization rate has
declined from 51.6% at the end of the first quarter to 47.5% at the end of June. This contributed to $126 million of
4

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
loan paydowns during the quarter, as we saw our clients use other available excess funds to pay down debt and
our utilization rates declines were seen across all loan categories.
Total production was $1.3 billion for the quarter, with PPP loans contributing $962 million. Setting aside the PPP
portfolio, loan production was lower than normal, but given the environment during the second quarter, our
bankers still found opportunities to take care of our clients' needs and produce an additional $295 million.
Construction in one-to-four family real estate was up compared to first quarter or as modest production declines
were seen in CRE, C&I and our agricultural portfolios. As Aaron previously mentioned, our cost of deposits
declined to just 7 basis points in the second quarter, compared to 14 basis points in the first quarter, reflecting the
full quarter impact of our response to the Fed interest rate drop in March. We continue to believe that our
relationship-based approach is a key differentiator and our clients rely on this as much as on any deposit interest
rate available in the market.
Excluding the PPP loans, the quarter production mix was 45% fixed, 42% floating and 13% variable. The overall
portfolio mix is now 10% PPP loans, 45% non-PPP fixed, 31% floating which is prime and LIBOR, and 14%
variable. Excluding the PPP program, new loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax
adjusted coupon rate of 3.79%, which is lower than the overall portfolio rate of 4.19% as of quarter end. Also
excluding the PPP loans, the overall portfolio rate declined 25 basis points during the quarter with construction
down 78 basis points and C&I down 32 basis points.
The lower rate environment has increased demand in the mortgage space. We are very pleased with the progress
of our residential lending business and its impact to non-interest income. We will continue to look for opportunities
to expand our mortgage solutions in both the purchase and the refinance markets in the future.
And now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you. The provision under CECL of $33.5 million reflects our economic forecast, which continues to be
negatively impacted from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a reminder, we use IHS Markit for our economic forecast.
In general, our forecast anticipates an annualized gross domestic product in the third quarter of 0.4% followed by
4.9% performance in the fourth quarter with the economy continuing to recover next year. Unemployment will
remain elevated, ending the year around 12.7% and ending 2021 at about 9.5%. Thus, the economic forecast
accounted for about $24 million of our provision for the quarter and negative migration accounted for the rest. We
ended the quarter with a provision relative to period-end loans of 1.55%. Adjusting for the PPP loans, the
allowance to period-end loans increases to 1.72%.
In contrasting the first quarter provision relative to the second quarter provision, the second quarter scenario is
much steeper of an economic impact than anticipated in the first quarter with a solid recovery in the latter half of
this year. Certainly, the economy has improved and statistics recently bear that out. However, the momentum and
path of the recovery is a lot more questionable given recent coronavirus cases and states halting or rolling back
opening. Adding to this uncertainty, there's the consumer reaction to the recent spike of coronavirus cases and
what will future government stimulus look like. Therefore, our modeling now reflects a more protracted recovery
with slower GDP growth and an unemployment rate that remains elevated.
NPAs for the quarter were relatively unchanged at 34 basis points. However, I feel adjusting for PPP loans
provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward into 2021. With this adjustment, NPAs do increase
5


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
but only by 2 basis points, so again relatively unchanged. I would like to remind folks, NPAs are still comprised of
credits whose issues predate the pandemic.
Past due loans for the quarter were 21 basis points and net charge-offs annualized were 16 basis points for the
quarter. Our impaired capital ratio rose modestly from 22.3% to 23.5%. Therefore, your standard credit metrics for
the quarter were very acceptable. Overall, when compared to the first quarter, it was a relatively stable quarter.
On the risk rating front, loans rated watch or below increased approximately $153 million during the quarter. We
saw watch loans increase $75 million, going from $310 million to $385 million. Special mention loans increased
$70 million to $387 million and substandard loans saw an increase of $8 million and are now around $313 million
in total.
These changes increased our watch and below risk rating from 10.4% to 11% of total loans. The sector which
saw the greatest migration was hospitality as it accounted for about 45% of the negative migration. The balance
was centered in other commercial real estate, however, over a broad range of categories.
On the deferral front, I want to remind folks that most of our deferral programs were for four months. So, the vast
majority will begin making payments in August. We granted over 3,000 requests for payment deferrals amounting
to about $1.6 billion in total loans through June 30. As I noted last quarter, we believe these deferrals are in the
best interest of all of our stakeholders as we try to work our way through this pandemic. Most of the deferrals, little
over 1,500 or roughly $690 million were granted to clients in our dental portfolio. Another $178 million in loan
deferrals were granted in hospitality followed by office of $116 million, healthcare non-dental $107 million, retail
$93 million, and restaurant at around $66 million. In total, the categories I just reviewed account for approximately
76% of our deferrals.
With that, I would now like to give you some color on the portfolios we believe to be some of the first impacted by
the pandemic. For Columbia that includes hotels, retail, restaurants, aviation and of course, our dental and
healthcare portfolio. In aggregate, these industries account for about $2.4 billion in loans or roughly 25% of our
loan portfolio.
The largest portfolio impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic is our dental portfolio. I am sure most of you are aware
most states had directed dental practices to cease operation, with the exception of emergency types of
procedures last March and April. So, effectively, most dental offices were closed until the end of May.
When we last spoke, about 86% of our portfolio was in states that had yet allowed dental practices to be opened.
Today, 100% of the states where we have exposure have allowed dental offices to open with appropriate COVID-
19 protocols in place. As of June 30, we had $879 million in dental-related loans, representing approximately
2,745 loans for an average loan size of $328,000. Therefore, it was a very granular portfolio.
Within this number is approximately 635 PPP loans for a gross balance of $67 million. So, the growth in this
portfolio was isolated to PPP loans. Again, we believe the impact on this portfolio is truly transitory. Today, most
of these practices are generating revenue at around 82% of pre-pandemic level. At this level of revenue
generation, we believe most of these practices are operating above breakeven. The combination of deferrals and
PPP loans are allowing these practices to move forward with little impact on the Bank's balance sheet. Today,
we've had very little requests for additional relief within the dental portfolio and continue to report 95% as pass
rated. Excluding the dental portfolio, we have another $1.6 billion or 16% of our portfolio to discuss.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
The next largest segment which we have identified as having high risk relative to the economic disruption caused
by COVID-19 is our retail portfolio. We have approximately $568 million in retail-related exposure, split between
commercial real estate and commercial business loans. This represents about 6.3% of our loan portfolio. Again,
growth in this portfolio was driven by PPP loans. We granted 394 PPP loans for a cumulative total of $75 million
to our retail customers.
The largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of commercial real estate loans with approximately $442
million in balances. It is evenly split between Washington and Oregon, and as you would expect, centered within
the Portland and Seattle MSAs. The average loan size is $370,000. Again, we provide retail loans primarily to
standalone retail centers like auto parts stores, building materials and garden stores, along with food and
beverage and gas stations. In addition, the portfolio contains grocery-anchored centers and mixed use properties,
mostly strip centers. We are not in large downtown core metropolitan areas nor do we finance regional malls.
Using at origination values, the average loan to value for the portfolio was 52% with 97% of the portfolio having a
loan to value less than 75%. We have stress tested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen in the
Great Recession. The average loan to value rises to 64% with about 72% of the properties having a loan to value
less than 75%. For the entire retail portfolio, 86% is pass rated, 7% is watch, 5% is special mention and 2%
substandard. The breakdown is essentially unchanged from the first quarter. We did see an uptick in deferral
requests in this portfolio during the second quarter and have granted about $93 million in loan deferrals or roughly
16% of the retail portfolio. Most of this activity occurred early in the quarter and the pace of new deferrals has
declined greatly, which is consistent across the entire portfolio.
Let me give you a little more color around deferrals for the entire portfolio. During the month of April, we granted
$1.2 billion in deferrals. Therefore, we are averaging about $298 million a week. During the month of June, we
granted $58 million in deferral for an average weekly volume of $12 million. So far through the first two weeks of
July, the weekly volume has declined to $5.4 million. So, the demand for deferrals has declined.
Okay, let's discuss hotels next. We have $336 million in hotel loans, representing about 3.4% of our loan portfolio.
About 35% is in major markets, which would include the Portland and Seattle MSAs. However, we also have
about 16% of the hotel portfolio or $55 million of exposure out on the Oregon coast. To give you an idea of the
types of hotels we finance, most have one of the following flags; Holiday Inn, Best Western, Choice, Marriott, and
Wyndham. In total, flag properties comprise 70% of the portfolio. The average loan size is $1.5 million. Today, we
have granted deferral requests for about $178 million or half of the portfolio.
We anticipate the recovery in the hotel sector to be prolonged. I would expect many of these clients will seek
additional support throughout 2020 and into 2021. With this in mind, we're working on a number of options for our
clients which include USDA program, the Main Street Lending Program, along with more conventional solutions
as well. Similar to the retail commercial real estate loans, we continue to do stress testing on this portfolio as well.
The average loan to value for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is 54% with 99% of the portfolio
having a loan to value less than 75%. On a stress basis, about 71% of the portfolio has a loan to value less than
75%.
Non-dental healthcare is about $297 million in total. This was another area where we saw a fair number of PPP
applications. We extended 322 PPP loans for around $48 million in this segment. PPP loan activity was thus
responsible for growth in this portfolio. Approximately $93 million of the portfolio is veterinary, another $152 million
are physician practices of varying kinds, and $52 million is other types of healthcare providers such as
chiropractors, physical therapists, and counseling services. The average loan size is $311,000. As of June 30,
98% of the portfolio is pass rated with 1% on watch and 1% rated substandard. We have granted deferral
7


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
requests for about $107 million in total in this segment or roughly 36% of the portfolio. Similar to the dental space,
we see this sector rebounding as folks are once again able to see their orthopedists, dermatologists or
optometrists. In addition, elective surgeries such as hip replacements, knee replacements, corneas, cataract and
cosmetic surgeries are now being performed.
Okay. Restaurants and food services, we have approximately $214 million in this portfolio, with two-thirds being
commercial real estate loans. The average loan size is $265,000. Today, 87% is pass rated, 6% is watch, 3%
special mention, and the balance is substandard. We have granted 157 deferrals for about $66 million in this
portfolio.
The portfolio did see negative migration during the quarter, primarily out of the pass and watch categories to
special mention and substandard. Similar to the hotel and retail segments, we see this area taking some time to
heal. We do stress testing on the CRE portion of this portfolio. And on a pre-pandemic basis, the average loan to
value was 58%, with 93% having a loan to value less than 75%, again, on a pre-pandemic basis. Under a stress
test scenario, loan to value rises to 72% with only 54% having a loan to value less than 75%.
The last portfolio I'm going to discuss is our aviation portfolio. It is comprised of both direct exposure to domestic
airline carriers as well as entities that lease airplanes and engines to airline carriers. In total, the portfolio is about
$148 million, with about $100 million being direct exposure to US domestic airlines and the remaining $48 million
in exposure to lessors of the airplanes.
Today, most of the portfolio is rated special mention with the exception of one credit rated watch and one rated
substandard. Of the domestic airlines we have exposure to, they have raised over $33 billion in additional capital
to assist them through this pandemic. Including carriers we do not have exposure to, the amount of capital raised
today exceeds $63 billion. As such, this additional capital combined with the expense reduction efforts results in
all of our borrowers having over 12 months of burn rate now.
In addition, these domestic airline carriers are continuing to negotiate agreements amounting to billions of
additional funding with the US Treasury via the CARES Act. Within our portfolio, our customers have executed a
little over $11.7 billion in signed letters of intent. And industry-wide, approximately $20 billion in letters of intent
have been executed. While no final agreements have been executed and no timeline for funding has been
provided, we know, if needed, additional capital is available. We believe this government funding will help them
recover from the COVID-19 impacts along with the billions of dollars of capital already raised.
Most of our domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft with a pre-stressed loan to value of 69% and a current
loan to value we believe closer to 72%. As for the leasing portfolio, 45% of the exposure is in Asia, 27% Europe,
and 8% North America. The rest is in South America and the Middle East. The majority of the portfolio consists of
narrowbody aircraft with an average age of 8.2 years. For the entire portfolio, the average age is 6.7 years with
widebody the lowest at 3.4 years. We view the younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft as being the most in demand
post pandemic. Based on origination values, our average loan to value for the portfolio is 73%. However, based
on what we believe is today's values, the loan to value is closer to 82%.
Okay. I'll now turn the call over to Clint.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Thank you, Andy. As I stated on our first quarter earnings call, Columbia Bank is actively meeting the challenges
of the disruptions caused by COVID-19. The strength of our balance sheet, credit profile that Andy just reviewed,
liquidity and capital position are serving us well and we continue to expand our reach.
Recent examples of the ongoing reinvestment in our business are the deployment of Zelle earlier this month and
the construction of our Boise NeighborHub which is scheduled to open later this quarter, sending a clear message
on our long-term commitment to the Treasure Valley.
We continue to receive recognition for the work we do on your behalf and are honored to recently have been
selected by Forbes as the best bank in both Washington and Oregon. These awards are a direct result of the
tremendous work done each day by our bankers.
Recent external events have underscored the importance of a company's values and culture. Diversity and open
discussion is core to Columbia Bank's culture and during this turbulent time, we continue to engage with our
employees in communities through active dialogue and outreach.
This morning, we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.28. This quarter's dividend payout of 54% of earnings
will be paid on August 19 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 5.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Q
Perfect. Thanks. And then I wanted to talk a little bit about the geography of the reserve build. Last quarter, we
saw that the majority of the increase was related to the commercial portfolio. Was it similar this quarter and do
you have the commercial and consumer reserve to loans ratio, excluding PPP, on hand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, our reserve isn't as complicated as some of the larger banks. So I know we allocate it, but I don't have those
numbers with me [indiscernible] (00:35:45). So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
That's okay. Yes. Okay. Then just kind of talking about the – if you look at I think it's on slide 19 that shows the
macro factors, again, kind of weighing on the majority of the reserve build. Looking forward, I mean, given the
kind of visibility that we have now versus kind of at quarter end, do you see that the majority of the reserve build
should kind of continue to be impacted by that or should it be probably more geared towards portfolio migration
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, first of all, our consumer book is really small and it's performing fine. So it's really not drawing much in
reserves. In terms of looking forward with CECL, it's all about your economic forecast. If you look at our first
quarter where we had over $400 million in loans downgraded, over 75% of the reserve build was due to the
economic forecast. So even in a quarter where you doubled the size of your, if you will, problem loans, it has a
muted impact from a reserve build standpoint.
So, the real, I think, wildcard continues to be the economic forecast. And of course, I said it in my speech, all the
recent economic data was pretty good although today unemployment came out at 1.4 million, unemployment
claims.
So I think the real question is what's going to happen to the consumer as we enter into the latter half of the third
quarter with rising cases. If you look at California and Texas, some of those states, they've rolled back much more
significantly than others. States like Idaho which we are in, historically, have not been impacted and now you
have the governor trying to get people to wear masks. So, if that puts the consumer back on the sideline, then the
economic forecast of the third quarter will continue to be poor and will thus continue to drive more provisioning. If
the consumer doesn't get frightened by that and the case counts improve and we don't end up going backwards,
then I think migration will have a larger percentage than what it has today. But it will still – the majority will still be
driven by the economic forecast. Does that help you at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yes. No, that was very helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly and maybe this is for Clint. Just kind of, on the PPP
loans, do you mind just giving us the kind of schedule that you guys are modeling for forgiveness and then what
percentage of the overall portfolio you expect to be forgiven?

I think that's still a bit of a moving target relative to what the entire process looks like and if Congress passes
expedited relief for the smaller ones. I know there's a bill circulating in the Senate right now that further modifies
the forgiveness process. But I'm going to defer to Chris. He's been very close to – in terms of our internal focus,
on the forgiveness process and what that might look like.

Thanks, Clint. Yeah. The process continues to evolve and we're obviously very hopeful, I'm sure that others, have
an expedited process and if you use an amount of about $150,000, that would be somewhere in excess of 3,000
of our requests that have an expedited forgiveness process. The rest kind of remains to be seen as the timing.
We're crossing our fingers and hopeful our clients are anxious to start that process and be able to move forward
as well. But we're really waiting for the guidance to come out of when we can actually submit. We're ready to go
[indiscernible] (00:40:20). We're anxious, our clients are anxious, but time is to be determined.
As far as the amount of overall forgiveness, I think that's going to be anybody's best guess. I think when we first
started having an eight-week timeframe in which to deploy the funds and some of the other restrictions that were
on it, I think it was a lower number.
I think extending through the end of the year, allowing the numbers to change from payroll to other types of items
as well puts in a position where a majority, and I'd say a high majority is likely to be forgiven. I think the program
has set itself up to – if a recipient spends the money correctly, then you'll have an extremely high forgiveness rate,
but there's also the opportunities where some folks may indeed go out of business or something.
So, I can't really give you a clear number, but I'm looking at it as there's a very high percentage that will be
actually forgiven from when they come out and it will trickle through the end of the year.

Levi Posen Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. I saw related to PPP that you guys broke out the benefit to interest income and you mentioned
that a majority of the decline in comp was related to the deferred expense there. I was wondering is there a
number for the deferred expense that was recognized this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I guess to maybe give some more color generally within the expense categories, maybe just break out kind
of five different items that I think will help you arrive at what might be considered a core rate. Within the comp and
benefits line, there's about $9.3 million and that was – the vast majority of which were those PPP origination cost,
so that is [ph] 91 (00:43:42) impact. In the – we also had a credit with our regulatory premiums that was about
12

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
$300,000 in the quarter. We had some outsized data processing costs of about $1.1 million. We had legal and
professional costs that were outsized by about $1.3 million.
And then in the other line, we had expenses there that were about $3.3 million outsized and that was largely the
provision for unfunded commitments. So if you add up each of those items, you come up with about $3.9 million in
total, kind of, what I would consider to be outsized or abnormal items and – which is pretty close to the $85 million
that we've talked about being a run rate.

Aaron James Deer A

No, not really. They just represent commercial real estate projects that were struggling pre-pandemic. There's a
couple of them that are in there. We've been working with these folks for a while. They're just kind of running out
of steam and so we placed them on non-accrual. We'll have to see where that goes. One, we'll probably take a
longer term work out. The other one I anticipate, one of the sponsors will probably dilute the other guys out. So
that would be just fine with us.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. I'm standing on the roof of my house. Hopefully this works. So, Aaron, a quick question for you. I'm sure
you had an interesting quarter, first one in the chair, but just let's get right to the margin in terms of you talked
about liquidity and loan pricing and prepayment fees. All of those are headwinds and I guess we understand that.
But how do you want us to think about the margin from here? And do those categories all kind of maybe through
payment fees don't, but the other categories kind of persist and cause some pressure in Q3?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. That's exactly right. And then I gave kind of a breakdown of those different drivers and we also have that
within the investor presentation that we posted to the website at the bottom of page 11. And so, it kind of shows
the shift from first quarter to second quarter and what drove that 38 basis point decline. Excess liquidity was
clearly a big part of that. As I mentioned, we're going to try to get more of that deployed, but we're going to do so
pretty conservatively as we try to ascertain what kind of – what the depositor behavior is with all the new inflows
that came onto the balance sheet.
So, hopefully as we get some of that deployed, that will help recover some of the pressure, but fundamentally, the
low rate environment is the real challenge here. And as an asset sensitive institution, there's not a great deal that
we can do given where our funding costs already are.
So, if you look at where our yields went quarter-to-quarter, you can see that it came down quite a bit on the loan
book as well as the investment securities. Our new purchases on investment securities during the quarter were
right around [ph] 150 (00:48:38). So, that book is going to continue to be under pressure. Similarly on the loan
side, as Chris mentioned, the new loans in the quarter came on at 3.79%, again well below what the average is
for the book.
Now, that arguably might be a little low just because of the mix of the types of credits we put on during the
quarter, so hopefully that will come up. But if that's where new asset yields are coming on the balance sheet,
obviously, we're facing a pretty strong headwind on that front. So, we'll try to make up some of that in terms of
how we're pricing products and getting more of this liquidity deployed. But I think the margin is going to be – the
core margin, I should say, is going to be real challenged.
Obviously, on the PPP loans, that too has added a little bit of pressure on it. Excluding the rate of forgiveness on
that, that could continue to cause a little pressure too, given the low yields on that category. But I would expect
that if the forgiveness comes in, I think as a lot of people expect over the next couple of quarters, the acceleration
of the fees related to that will at least give a non-core bounce to the margin. So, we'll – it's kind of wait and see
how that plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. I know it's hard to project, but that helps. Andy, a question for you. It was great detail on what you've
considered maybe stressed or at-risk categories. But is it safe to assume that those that are not on deferral would
be credits that you consider healthy or they have the resources to stick around and pay their loans? Is that a fair
assessment?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think that, that's at all a bad characterization. And there are a lot of businesses that I – even within
our hotel segment, not every hotel is doing poorly. We have some properties that have really benefited in a
strange way because of COVID and other types of facilities have closed down. And so, for construction workers,
for example, the extended stay folks are doing quite well in a lot of the rural markets to achieve social distancing
and then also to provide a place in case a coworker in a processing plant or a manufacturing plant gets tested. A
lot of businesses are renting hotel rooms to have those places where those individuals can go for 14 days and get
quarantined before they go back to work. So there are a lot of things like that. And so, yes, I would agree with
your characterization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then last one kind of a random question, but maybe it's for Chris or Clint. But curious if there's a way to
characterize how your people are spending their time today versus how they were spending their time, say, back
in January, February. I'm assuming it was all hands on deck with PPP. But I'm just curious to kind of gauge a
sense of normalcy, what are your people doing today versus what they were doing pre-pandemic, if that makes
sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I'll start and then I'll let Chris finish. As we got past the grind of the PPP origination process and into the
month of May, we really started focusing on what's the new normal at least for this interim period. And I think that
the work that we did then has actually set us up for what – how things have played out since then as we look at
even things like schools across the country going virtual, the impact that has on families, the capabilities that we
have for folks who can work remotely, but also the need for continuing to stay connected to the organization and
rotate them into the offices in a safe, socially distanced manner.
What we've seen, I'd say, over the last two months and this is even true for the executive team as we've started
resuming some of what we would consider normal types of activities, traveling throughout the footprint, spending
time in market with our bankers, doing some client calls, it's very different. Some of those client calls now by our
bankers are being done via things like Microsoft Teams or Zoom, but some are also occurring in person. And I
think that's something that our bankers have embraced is getting back to what feels normal to them and the ability
to not only take care of their existing client base, but also continue to develop their prospects and win new
business and we've had some examples in the last 45 or 60 days of significant wins on the new business front.
And so, it's not business as usual because I think as a society right now, nothing is normal, but it certainly is a
sustainable way for us to continue to grow our franchise and that's what I was getting at in my prepared remarks.
And I believe the term I used was we continue to expand our reach and I referenced the rollout of Zelle.
So, we're still focused on – digital is more important than ever and the work we've done in the last several years is
certainly paying big dividends now, but also we're looking at markets that we're very bullish on and expanding our
physical presence like what we're doing in Downtown Boise. So, I think that all of those types of activities give our
bankers a sense of normalcy. And I'll turn it over to Chris to fill in any gaps that I might have missed.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Thanks, Clint. Jon, I think the parts that I can fill in on is with a return to a little bit of normalcy, I mean our – as I
mentioned, our facilities, our branches, our lobbies were open majority of the time during the last quarter. And
what we've seen is people moving more to utilizing drive-throughs, utilizing mobile deposit options. And so, we
spent some time working on scripting and outreach to our clients since they're not coming in quite in the same
amounts to proactively start talking to them about the things like Zelle, pretty extensive project that went into that
and promoting that, so that we can see that adoption rate move and increase.
I'd say also folks have looked at the opportunities of while they may not be able to travel where they wanted to,
they may not be able to go on a European vacation, we've encouraged our folks to find time to get away from the
office and just try and decompress because it really has been all hands on deck and quite a sprint for the six
months of the first half of the year.
And so encouraging to do that knowing that the second half, we're going to be faced with some – and our
employees will with school closures and what that means. So, again, trying to give people some relaxation and
some rest.
In the meantime, it's focused on the business going forward. And you've heard us talk about the things that we've
invested in and we do, we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to look at our distribution network, but we're also
remaining opportunistic and there are – there is a business that is out there, there are opportunities coming up.
As Clint mentioned, people are working their prospects, it is different. There's not as much entertainment or
anything of that nature, don't expect that will probably change throughout the end of the year. But our team has
been very effective with their approach and their experience is weighing out in that.
And then in certain business lines, we've seen a real uptick back to more of a normal pre-flighting new deals. It
wouldn't be surprising if I told you that in the second quarter, our healthcare group did about 10% of their normal
volume. As Andy described, the dental offices were foreclosed, so that made perfect sense. You're starting to see
a lot of that come back and we're looking at those very closely, and not to belabor it, but we do spend more time
on each and every deal, making sure we understand not only where they've been, but what are they doing to
evolve their business in the COVID environment and what's coming because now it's more important than ever to
understand the changes and how that could potentially impact their revenue. So new loan deal takes – it takes
longer, but it's a very disciplined approach that we've always had and we're sticking to it. So I'm hopeful that
provides you some color.

Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi, [ph] David (00:59:42).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
I just wanted to get your thoughts and you just touched on it a bit, but just thoughts on organic growth. Loans ex-
PPP were down a bit more than expected. It seems like this is largely due to declining C&I utilization. But just
curious the trends you're seeing. How much of this was strategic like were you tightening the credit box versus
asset sales or just simply less demand for new credit? And I guess, thoughts on growth going forward, where
you're interested in growing and even where you're seeing demand from new credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. This is Andy. Yeah, I think that the second quarter was a tough quarter for everybody. And so there just
wasn't demand on the C&I or the CRE front for much activity. And so I think if you look across the industry, that's
pretty consistent for most banks. I think too the bankers were extremely distracted by the encompassing nature of
PPP. As we've kind of moved beyond that, with the PPP and the relatively modest activities, the cash build also
means to pay down on the revolvers and I believe our utilization on revolvers is now 43%. So it's down
significantly.
What we are seeing, though, is businesses are starting to begin to get a little bit more active in the front of looking
at, okay, I still need to keep my business running, I still need to invest in capital projects that ensure that I remain
competitive. I think there are more modest projects than maybe what we had seen in the past. We aren't seeing
people necessarily moving to new markets or launching new products, but rather investing in what they already
do and do well. And so, from that perspective, the credit decisions are a little easier.
We also have seen an opening up in the construction area with the states opening up and so construction activity
again is moving forward. As Chris noted earlier, activity in the homebuilding segment is very strong and we're also
seeing commercial real estate projects now getting back under way. And so those are kind of areas where we see
growth in demand, but I would characterize it as modest at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. [ph] David (01:02:39), I'd agree with Andy on that, but it's building. We're seeing some things come back.
There's still folks that are cautious, but we're also starting to hear more about businesses that are potentially
wanting to sell and so that transition will create opportunities. And we're doing all we can to be in front of our
centers of influence and things, and be in the right place to participate in those. But again, we'll have to look at
each and every one of them with a higher level of due diligence and which makes perfect sense in this
environment.
And I wouldn't say it's any one specific area. We've always had a philosophy of being in markets, we'll be
cautious. But we'll look for opportunities that are available in any space and know that we're going to have to work
a little harder to maybe find the best of the best, but that's part of what we do in the discipline.

So, between the production and Andy's credit team, we work very closely and spend a lot of time right now pre-
flighting things and looking at them, so that we end up with a good client experience and also end up with a good
credit that joins our book. So, optimistic is the best way to look at it, but there's a lot of unknowns that are out
there that could change that at any time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay, that's helpful. And then just kind of following up on that production commentary, has there been any – I'm
just curious to get your thoughts on hiring. Has all of this disruption created additional opportunity for new hires
and maybe expand into new markets and pick up a team that's kind of been on the short list and maybe be a bit
more aggressive while a lot of others are kind of being more fearful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, the short answer is yes. We continue to look at opportunities. You never know when somebody from that
organization might be ready. So we've always had an eye to good people, good teams, and we're always open for
that coming on board. As Clint mentioned, we're expanding our presence in Boise with opening of the
NeighborHub there. And so, disruption happens across the industry at all places and different organizations are
going to attack problems in different manners and that creates opportunities for the right individuals to potentially
look for something different. And I think our values and our culture and the way we do business attracts a certain
type of individual and we've been successful at that in the past and we expect to continue to be successful with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick one and I apologize if I missed it. But do you have an estimate for
net PPP fees that are expected to come through, net of deferred or net of origination costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A

We'll look at that. I'm not sure that we're disclosing that, but I don't know – you can follow up afterwards, I guess.

different things is, I think we're probably in that range of what you all are predicting for the industry as a whole

Hey. Good morning. I apologize if you guys already touched on this. I've been jockeying between a couple of
other calls. I guess with the deferrals and knowing almost half of them came from the dental portfolio, do you have

cure here in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's great. Okay. And then just Seattle, you had [indiscernible] (01:07:15). Portland looks like a disaster these
days. I guess, how is this impacting kind of day-to-day – not really at the Bank but just among your customer
base, have you seen any kind of disrupt business within your portfolio or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't know that we're seeing a tremendous amount of business disruption from our clients and even our self with
operations in both those areas. We've had the nuisance of some broken windows and vandalism with tagging and
other things that you can quickly address. I think it's more the underlying themes that I'm hearing from clients and
businesses, and Chris and I had a meeting with one yesterday that's been located in Downtown Seattle for their
entire 20-year history. Their lease is up next year and they're looking at Bellevue. So, I think that's really the risk
longer term is you had both Seattle and Portland are beautiful downtown cities that are on some sort of a – they're
at a turning point. And for several years, the City Council for Seattle has been marginally anti-business and I think
what we're seeing there is it's no longer even marginal. And so that's concerning, but I think it's also an
opportunity for greater metro area. I think it's an opportunity for the Tacoma and Pierce County community where
we're headquartered and have a lot bigger operations. And I think it's a tremendous opportunity for Bellevue and
Eastern King County. And then also if you think about the Portland metro area, there is the opportunities across
the river in Vancouver and in some of the outlying communities that are outside of Multnomah County there. I
wouldn't say I'm losing sleep over this, but I wake up in the morning thinking about the possibility of some of the
business climate that we're seeing in Seattle and in Portland spreading to these other communities that I just
mentioned.

And then I do think then in that case, it could be very disruptive to our clients. That's why I think I'm pretty bullish
on the Boise, Idaho market as well as that the time that we've spent there and meeting with the economic
development and chamber and other folks and just seeing the sheer volume of inquiries they're getting from
business relocations. So time's going to tell. I think it's – we're a little over a year away from elections for the city
council. And I think that's where we'll see kind of if business folks, what they're thinking and what we're hearing
now. But it is something that I think we're all closely monitoring and I don't know, Andy or Chris, have any
additional insight.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think most of it is in there. It's not really disrupting our day-to-day operations, but it's more staying close to any
and all clients that we have and what their thoughts are. I think the best time to kind of hammer home is, one, pay
attention to it and then, two, Clint summarized it well by saying time will tell. But it's an obvious concern for us.

...most of the activities in downtown core areas where it's white collar people, they're mostly working from home
anyway. So it's not really disrupting businesses from that perspective. I think what the bigger issue for businesses
mostly in the Seattle market is just how business friendly the community and the city is. And the taxing
environment is what's really pushing people across Lake Washington to Bellevue.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just back to the PPP, how are you guys modeling kind of the forgiveness process
here? You kind of sensed that most of it, if not all of it, will be forgiven. And what's your expectation on timing as
you think it will be more fourth quarter and then maybe a little bit into the first quarter and then be gone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Matthew, in terms of modeling that out, there's a lot of uncertainty. Obviously, the notes are two year terms, but
the expectation is that a lot of it is forgiven relatively quickly. We're, I think, expecting the majority of that to
happen, the vast majority of it really in the back half of this year and into early next year, but it's really hard to say
exactly what the exact timing of that's going to be.

Matthew, there's also some unknowns of that of when we can submit. So, that's one unknown. And then when we
do submit, when we actually receive the reimbursement. So, there's some things that we're still unknown in that,
so it could drive a little bit.

...you can't even do it. Well, you can't even get participants today, even if you wanted to, which is the beauty of
this program, but I think that for a lot of businesses because of the accounting impact, they're going to want to get
it done in 2020.

No. We usually delete those in-house when they come in.

Operator: We have our next question from Gordon McGuire. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Aaron, I wanted to follow up on the margin discussion and particularly the potential for deposit outflows other
than those that are PPP-related. I guess, I was wondering if you could hazard a guess trying to size up what that
could look like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. I will tell you this, it's something we've spent a lot of time thinking about, because obviously the deposit
flows were very strong. And so we've gone back and looked at the past cycles to see what consumer and
business depositor behavior was like at that time.
Having gone through that exercise, we actually feel pretty good that this should be pretty sticky funding, but at the
same time, this is unlike anything we've really faced before. So, at this point, I think we're assuming that a lot of
the PPP funds are utilized for business purposes as expected over the coming months and with the remainder of
inflows that we've seen for other reasons. We're hopeful that a lot of that sticks around. But we're also going to be

prudent in terms of how we get that investment. And so, it's – there's just a lot of uncertainty to it. But hopefully, at
least gives you some color on our thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Nope, that does. And if it were to stick around, if you felt more confident with it, would you consider – I know you
typically target about $800 million in non-core funding balances, would you consider moving those lower, if the
lower cost deposits were stickier?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Say the question again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I think historically, you've tried to manage non-core funding to around $800 million. And I was wondering if you do
determine that these deposit inflows are a little bit more sticky, whether you consider moving that $800 million
[indiscernible] (01:16:43) lower...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sorry. I apologize. Yeah, we have in fact actually already let a lot of that higher cost funding go. So if it makes
sense to do so, we will continue to do that. So we've had it in the past as part of balance sheet strategy but given
where rates are now, we're very focused on keeping the funding costs as low as we possibly can. Obviously, our
deposit cost at 7 basis points is hard to beat elsewhere, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just housekeeping, I wanted to double check. Does the PPP fees, do they show up in the footnote, the
margin footnote with the $5.1 million of net deferred loan fee amortization or is that layered on top?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Repeat the question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
In the margin footnote, where you give us the amortization levels of the net – of the deferred loan fees this
quarter. I'm curious if PPP flows through that number and I think it was $5.1 million this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We'll follow up.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A

The PPP would be small because those are 40-year notes, so they weren't outstanding for very long to amortize
much of the fee in the income.
