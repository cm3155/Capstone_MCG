Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I want to begin by reviewing the highlights and
key metrics for the year and then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our
perspectives on 2023.
I'm very pleased to say that 2022 was the second strongest year for earnings in our company's history. We
reported net income of $1 billion or $3.77 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion or $15.50 per share for
the full year. This was accomplished against a fluid and unusual macroeconomic and monetary policy backdrop
and I want to thank the entire Discover team for their solid execution. This performance gives us significant
momentum going into 2023 and beyond.
I want to give a few highlights that underscore these strong results. First, we grew new accounts by 23% and loan
receivables by 20%. This demonstrates the appeal of our consumer value proposition and advancements in our
consumer targeting and acquisition capabilities, while maintaining our conservative approach to underwriting and
credit management.

We're also prudently investing for growth, including in acquisition and brand marketing, the continuing build-out of
our data and analytic capabilities and increasing field personnel for both servicing and collections, all while
achieving a 39% efficiency ratio.
The combination of revenue expansion and disciplined cost management contributed to our 31% return on equity
this past year and underscores the highly capital-generative nature of our business model. Over the course of
2022, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock and increased our dividend by over 20% and we expect to
sustain attractive levels of capital return to our shareholders into the future.
As we look into 2023, we expect a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Nevertheless, we intend to maintain
an appropriate level of investment in our organization. For example, we have several initiatives that will improve
our digital marketing capabilities and we anticipate the broad market launch of our mass-market Cashback Debit
product. And of course, we'll continue to invest in our brand and in account acquisition in a manner consistent with
the environment. We're very aware of the climate in which we are operating. And should there be changes in
economic conditions, we will adjust.
Our model, with its focus on prime lending and through-the-cycle underwriting, has historically supported resilient
returns through the economic cycle. These factors, combined with our earnings power, reserves and capital,
underpin our strategy of being the leading consumer digital bank.
I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in [audio gap] (00:04:35).

Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide 4. The
takeaway of the quarter is largely about strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion, partially offset by
growth-based provisioning.
Asset growth, combined with a NIM rate improvement, increased revenue 7% sequentially and 27% year-over-
year. Similar to last quarter, asset growth also drove an increase in our reserves of $313 million. This increase
kept our reserve coverage ratio relatively flat at 6.6%.
In the prior year, we released $39 million of reserves. So while our reported net income was down 3% year-over-
year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 23% higher on a year-over-year basis.
Let's review the details starting on slide 5. Net interest income was up $584 million year-over-year or 24%. Our
net interest margin expanded, benefiting from the higher prime rate, partially offset by higher funding costs and
increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.27%, up 46 basis points from the prior year and 22
basis points sequentially. For the full year, NIM was 11.04%, up 28 basis points from the prior year.
Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales,
new account growth and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 8% in the period, a deceleration from the
15% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and 20% in the first half of the year. New card accounts grew by
17% from last year's fourth quarter.
Similar to the prior quarter, the sales growth decline was mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell
150 basis points in the quarter. We expect payment rates to continue to decline through 2023, but at a more
moderate pace.

Turning to our non-card products. Organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations.
Personal loans were up 15%. We continue to stay disciplined in our approach to marketing, underwriting and
pricing of this product. Our attractive value proposition has positioned us well in the market that is experiencing
strong consumer demand and some improvement in competitive conditions.
In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Deposit
pricing continues to be in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. Recently, we have seen some
moderation in the pace of pricing changes.
Looking at other revenue on slide 6. Non-interest income increased $212 million or 47%. This was partially due to
a $138 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $6 million loss this quarter.
Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 14%. This increase was primarily driven by two items. First,
loan fee income was up $51 million or 39%, driven by volume. And second, we had higher net discount and
interchange revenue, which was up $23 million or 7%, reflecting strong sales and a favorable sales mix, partially
offset by higher rewards costs.
Moving to expenses on slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $183 million or 14% year-over-year and up 8%
from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased head count and wage inflation.
Marketing expenses increased $42 million or 15% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and
consumer banking products. Premise and equipment expense was elevated this quarter due to a one-time write-
off related to the exit of our Phoenix servicing location.
Adjusting for this, premise and equipment would have been flat to the prior year quarter. With this recent action,
we have resized or exited three of our four major call center locations and will continue to evaluate our footprint
going forward.
Moving to credit performance on slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.13%, 76 basis points higher than the prior
year and up 42 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 2.37% was 87
basis points higher than the prior year and 45 basis points higher sequentially. As expected, portfolio loss rates
are normalizing, reflecting seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years, normalization of older
vintages and mild deterioration in low credit bands, largely inflation-driven.
These trends are within our expected risk tolerances and are consistent with our historical approach to
underwriting and credit management. Among our core prime revolver segment, we don't see evidence of broader
stress given the robust labor market. I'll cover our 2023 view in a moment.
Turning to the discussions of our allowance on slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $313 million,
driven by the increase in receivable balances. Our reserve rate declined slightly to 6.6%. Adjusting for the
elevated level of transactor balances in the fourth quarter, our reserve rate would have been near sequentially
flat.
Under the CECL accounting standard, we are required to contemplate life of loan losses and adjust our reserve
levels accordingly. For us, the changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to our forecast.
For the year-end 2022 reserve, our baseline assumption was unemployment in 2023 between 4.5% and 5%, with
alternative scenarios above 6%.

Looking at slide 10. Our Common Equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.3%. Our longer-term target remains at
10.5%. We expect to make progress against this target over the next four to six quarters. Yesterday, we
announced a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased
$602 million of common stock.
Concluding on slide 11 with our outlook. Momentum is strong, which should help to generate double-digit revenue
growth and positive operating leverage. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be in the low double-digits with
average loan growth somewhat higher.
This is driven by three factors: our prior year growth in new accounts, moderation in the payment rate and sales
volume trends. Through mid-January, sales are up 13%, but we expect deceleration to the high single-digits over
the course of the year. We expect net interest margin to be modestly higher than the full-year 2022 levels. More
specifically, we expect NIM to be above the fourth quarter levels in the first half of the year, driven by continued
loan repricing benefits and decline in the second half.
We are looking for total operating expenses to increase less than 10%. Salary and benefit expense will increase
due to hiring in the second half of 2022. Additionally, we expect marketing to be above our full-year 2022 level.
We expect net charge-offs will average between 3.5% and 3.9% for the full year. The low end of the range is
more in line with our base case, while the high end is more consistent with a weaker employment scenario.
Lastly, we have $2.8 billion of remaining capacity under the $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires in
June of this year. We expect to repurchase around $2.2 billion of shares in the first half of 2023. We'll provide an
update on future share repurchase authorizations after we complete our stress testing process and review
recommendations with our board.
In summary, receivable growth continued to benefit from new account acquisition, payment rate moderation and
positive sales. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases with funding costs consistent with expectations,
and credit is performing in line with our approach to through-the-cycle underwriting process and conservative
credit management.
Our perspectives for 2023 reflects our focus on advancing our strategic priorities, generating high returns and
capital, while remaining disciplined in our credit and expense management.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit
Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And John, thanks for kind of outlining the parameters of the range of expected credit loss. But
could you talk a little bit about the past kind of from here to getting to the 3.5%? Like what either has to happen
that's bad or not happen that's good, and at what points along that way would you know whether that 3.5% base
case is too high or too low?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Moshe. So, the range is [ph] somewhat locked (00:16:20), right?
3.5% to 3.9% for 2023. And we certainly have a great deal of visibility through the first six months of the year
through a roll rate methodology. Post six months, so in the second half of the year, we use our analytical models,
which anticipate a number of different possible outcomes, but used as historical data that's been tested
significantly to make a projection of what we expect to happen.
So as we get through the first quarter, we'll be able to see what's happening with our roll rates in terms of is it a
roll to one bucket and a roll to two bucket, consistent with our expectations on the base case on the reserve.
Beyond that, we'll certainly look at the macro environment and what's happening with unemployment levels and
the overall job market. That will give us some perspective. And then an important component of this, and I know
there were some questions in terms of the step-up from where we ended 2022 to where we're projecting 2023.
We have fairly significant vintages that are going through the normal seasoning process right now.
So for example, our end-of-period card portfolio, so last year 12/31 to this year 12/31, increased by $15.7 billion.
And if you think about kind of a maturity cycle of a credit card, typically within the first year to two years, you hit
peak losses. So that is some of what we're expecting here and therefore, the guidance that we've provided.
We do expect that in a stable macroeconomic environment, in the second half of the year, we should see this
slope of the curve begin to bend down a little bit with perhaps top losses coming through in 2024 and then
returning down. So overall, what we're seeing here is just a strong portfolio, very significant vintages that came
through in 2021 and 2022 that are seasoning at levels that are completely within our expectation of total return
thresholds. And then we'll see the overall portfolio normalize. So hopefully, that provides some clarity on both the
trajectory as well as what we're seeing in the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Perfect. Thanks, John. And just as a follow up, the reserve rate was down. You mentioned that was largely a
result of transactor balances. But I guess even with that, it wasn't up. And so when you think about that, kind of
how do you – I mean how should we think – it doesn't feel like you're anticipating a deteriorating environment if
you're keeping your reserve certainly no worse than flat. And how do we think about that going through 2023 as
well? Thank you.

John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes, great question. And they're connected. So happy to cover them in the same set. So CECL reflects life of loan
losses as we all know, right? And so what drives that is the portfolio performance and our view of the
macroeconomic environment today and going forward. And we haven't had any substantial changes to the
macroeconomic environment. And essentially, the portfolio is performing within our expected ranges of outcomes.
So as we looked at the fourth quarter receivable balances in the aggregate and the portfolio performance, a
stable macro, we felt most appropriate reserve levels would be fairly consistent with what we did in the third
quarter. And essentially, without taking you through a ton of detail that teams spend weeks and weeks working
through, that's essentially how we arrived at the answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up question to the credit questions Moshe asked. John, you talked
about the seasoning. Is there any way to parse apart the impact of seasoning in your range versus the actual
degradation as a result of just the deteriorating delinquencies on a base case.
And then you mentioned sort of the slope of the curve decelerates, I think you said in the second half, but just
want to make sure to understand sort of how the seasoning will impact us for the next two years. Does it still
weigh in on you in the first half of 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So, in terms of the impact of the vintages, I explicitly called out the card vintage in 2022, so the $15.7 billion,
to give the folks that are listening here a place to anchor on in terms of thinking about the vintage and then you
can run out peak losses for our portfolio in terms of what typically happens after a significant vintage and in a
stable macro. So that should help you at least in terms of the thinking in terms of the vintage.
As we think about this year, we gave that range of 3.5% to 3.9 on the average loan base. So you should think
about the ultimate kind of range here. It will depend first on the macro. Second, we'll continue to give updates in
each of the quarters in terms of what we're seeing. But ultimately, we expect this vintage will mature in 2024 and
then we should see, in a stable macro, the curve, not only the slope bending, but actually inverting slightly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Follow-up question on loan growth. Obviously, you mentioned the strong growth driving the seasoning, but
you guys are still expecting double-digit growth in the face of maybe a tougher economic backdrop. What gives
you the comfort here? Maybe Roger, speaking to the growth in the past, and I know every cycle takes on a
different complexion. What are you guys looking at that makes you comfortable to grow here? Because that's a
question I get quite a bit from investors.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Yes. Good question, Sanjay. I think you've seen us operate this business through multiple cycles and the
disciplined approach we take both in good times as well as in bad. And frequently, the accounts that you put on
during a challenging economic time perform extraordinarily well and you can see very good cost per account as
competitors pull back. So, we have been pretty clear that starting in the back half of last year, we started
tightening credit standards and you can expect us to continue to look at that and adjust according to economic
conditions, both for new accounts as well as the portfolio. Nevertheless, we're seeing great returns on the
marketing investments we're putting out there. And so, that's what gives us the confidence to keep investing in
growth.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Morning guys and thanks for taking my questions and not to beat the dead horse, but maybe just one more
question on the kind of the provisioning and the credit. John, I think you kind of detailed the unemployment
assumptions. I think they were kind of in the 4.5% to 6% range with maybe [ph] similar (00:25:24) making the 5%
range kind of the middle of the fairway. Just maybe can you tell us what's the sensitivity for either the charge-offs
or the ALL (sic) [ALLL] if say unemployment moves to level like 100 basis points higher than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So, in our kind of primary case here, we assumed a 100 basis points increase in unemployment. Now that
was specific to our charge-off forecast. In terms of kind of reserve levels, we actually used a composite of multiple
scenarios. The more heavily weighted scenario reflected a loss rate of 4.5% and then going up all the way to 6%.
So, I'm feeling actually like we're down the middle here in terms of appropriateness, in terms of overall reserve
levels and more specificity in terms of sensitivity. I don't think that would be a service given, if we're seeing
unemployment kind of creep up in that sort of manner or that sort of quantum, that would indicate that the macro
environment has changed and we have to change our view on that, which could change our perspectives on life
of loan losses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then you gave annual guidance with NIM and it sounds like maybe an elevated NIM in
the first part of the year coming down second. What are the drivers of that with respect to the yield and the cost of
capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Yes. So, I'm going to run through the primary drivers. So, first would be the Fed rate changes in the second
half of 2022 as well as what we've anticipated either two or three increases in 2023. Second impact is the yield on
our investments, which is improving with the increase in the rate environment. And then the third piece has been
some pricing actions we took in the consumer banking products. So think about the non-card products.

Discover Financial Services
(DFS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
So, offsetting that would be kind of the cost of funding. So DTC and external funding costs have increased. And
then we're also anticipating an impact from credit, all of which the net of those gives us a high level of confidence
that certainly, we're going to see peak NIM in the first quarter and then stepping down from there through 2023.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. I have one more credit question for you. I know you don't generally give out guidance more than one year
out, but I think some of the commentary around the charge-off guidance has some implications for 2024. I just
wanted to try and clarify. I mean, if you look at the guidance range, it seems to imply you kind of exit 2023 at a
charge-off rate at 4% to 4.5%. I think John, you indicated 2024 as kind of a peak year. Should we expect – is it
reasonable to assume that that's implying kind of a charge-off rate north of 4% for 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, you were right on your call here. We gave a range for 2023 of 3.5% to 3.9%. I talked about the curve
and what we think will happen to the curve and the slope of that. So Mark, as a matter of prudence, I think that's
probably as far as I'm going to go here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Maybe a slightly different way to address this question is you perhaps could give us some
color on where you have seen your fully seasoned vintages peak in terms of net charge-off rates and around what
kind of months within the seasoning path that happens, you know, range of months. That would be helpful to
understand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So typically, we'll see it around 18 months. And it varies based on credit quality. So the highest credit
quality, so think FICO, would typically peak a little later. And then the weaker – I'll say, the weaker credits typically
peak a little bit earlier. But on average, think about 18 months or so.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And the level that you've been seeing, it would be helpful to understand how, historically, the vintages that you
underwrite to are trajecting in terms of peak. And maybe if you could comp 2022 vintage and 2021, what you're
seeing there would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So the first part of that answer would be it would depend on the vintage. So, if you go back to our 2020
vintage and remember, there's COVID, right, we were locked down, we ceased underwriting kind of the near
prime and lower prime and concentrated on upper prime. That vintage will season at a peak loss level below what
Discover historically has done. If you look at 2021, 2022, we were essentially back to a underwriting standard
consistent with history. And you can use that information to get some level of comfort around what can be
expected in 2024 on this vintage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Because you're basically saying 2022 is a normal – is exhibiting behavior that is more normal pre-COVID
type of vintages?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
It is. Yes. Yes. The one difference that I think is important for folks to codify in their minds is that we're coming off
an abnormally low base, right? So the entire portfolio is normalizing. We've talked about that consistently actually
since the beginning of last year that we thought the portfolio was normalizing. And what you're seeing here in the
2023 guidance is essentially the portfolio normalizing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
But the current reserve ratio level is consistent with this normalization whereby peak losses hit in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Otherwise, my controller would have taken exception to our reserve process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And this is – I know we're talking about card, but is this the same kind of expectation across the other asset
classes as well, student, personal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Although what we're seeing in personal loans is, again, loss rates below historical norms. Payment rate is
beginning to normalize. And we had talked about the fact that we perhaps overcorrected on that product in terms
of underwriting, in terms of the pullback. We pulled back significantly.
11


Discover Financial Services

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
So I expect some seasoning and normalization there. But again, we're very, very confident about the loss
performance of that product. We understand where it is on the payment priorities for folks. So we're going to be
mindful of the economy on that.
And student loans, yeah, that's normalizing. We did have and likely will have a little bit of impact when we see the
full impact of these student debtors on the government programs having to pay back loans. But it's underwritten to
a high standard. 80-plus percent have cosigners. So we feel very comfortable about that product as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Look, this is an interesting milestone where the reserve rate is 658 basis points.
It basically is apples-to-apples seasonality versus CECL day one and up 50 basis points. I'm curious when we
think about your economic outlook and how you build a CECL reserve, where you compare to CECL day one on a
like-for-like basis, would you build the same allowance? Or have you made adjustments and then compare your
economic outlooks in each of those points in time, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So good question, Rick. So we've referenced CECL day one in the past, but I'd like to remind folks, day one
was – first time we rolled this new standard out, we were using new models. They've been tested extensively. And
the macros were late-cycle with higher unemployment levels. So as we look at kind of where we are today or as
of the fourth quarter, right, 6.58% in terms of total loss reserve rate. That seems appropriate based on kind of
what we're seeing in the macros and how the portfolio is performing. So do we specifically reference day 1 only
from the standpoint of where it was back on January 1, 2020, to where it is today? But we don't use that as a
decision point whatsoever.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
John, understood. I'm more curious that if you like were – you've described that the models have evolved. And I
think that that's fair and I think everybody appreciates that. What I'm asking is on a like-for-like basis, do you think
that reserve rates are lower today using the same assumptions as you refine them versus CECL day one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. No, no, they're not lower. We're looking at the portfolio performance. It's performed extraordinarily well.
We're seeing a bit of seasoning now, as you would expect in this type of product. And the macros are
contemplating a minimum level of increase in unemployment of at least 0.5% and more likely 1%. So what you're
seeing here is a CECL reserve for the quarter that reflects those macros.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Thank you, and good morning. Maybe some commentary, Roger, on the competitive environment for rewards.
I mean, you've seen very strong growth out of a number of players in the industry, including yourselves. Are you
seeing more competition? Where are you seeing more competition, more people getting more aggressive, if you
would?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Bob. It remains, I would say, intensely competitive. But as you've seen from the growth, especially
the performance in new accounts, our value proposition is competing well. And again, I want to give credit to
some of the advancements on the analytics that let us sort of personalize the marketing messages across
different channels. I guess where competition has lightened a bit is in the personal loan space. I think there are a
lot of non-bank-funded folks there who may have some challenges on the other side of the balance sheet and
obviously, one big player who had been active is pulling out.
On the deposit side, I would see there, I think you're starting to see the gap between the direct banks and the
branch banks really get wide enough that you're seeing flows to the direct system, right?
It's now at 3.3% for savings rate. It's now a lot more worth your money, so again, really excited about how our
products are competing across every segment. And so that's part of why we're optimistic going into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
What new products? I mean your Cashback Debit is something that you've talked about. What new products are
you most excited about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
You're highlighting probably the big launch for next year, which will be the re-launch of Cashback Debit and we
hope to be doing some mass-market advertising of that. Beyond that, I really believe we have the right product
set. We're seeing great demand, for example, on the home equity side, given how rates have moved and the lack
of cash-out refi.
So I think part of how we keep our costs as low as they are, is a very simple, lean operating model. So I wouldn't
expect anything other than the re-launch of the Cashback Debit and we'll put a lot of weight behind that.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Back to the credit topic, anything about the charge-off guidance that's baked into your guidance that is a surprise
at all in terms of what you're observing? I know you talked about the seasoning and the vintages and it sounds
like there's nothing there that really surprised you.
But I'm wondering, anything about the credit migration within the vintages, within the portfolio and the past dues or
customer behavior that surprised you that led to the increase in the charge-off guidance that seems to be well
above where the Street was expecting. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, John. Actually, no surprises in the portfolio performance whatsoever and I want to reiterate that.
And that's essentially why the reserve rate is flat, right? So they are connected. So what that says is that charge-
off guidance was essentially contemplated in the reserving of life of loan losses. So we feel very good about that
and there is consistency.
I did talk about in my prepared remarks that the lowest end of the credit spectrum that we have in our portfolio, so
some near-prime and some folks without FICO scores or those who fell below 660, are certainly feeling the
impact from inflation. But internally, we completely anticipated that we had run some analysis on inflation shocks
and what it would do to some of the card members and it's performing essentially where we thought it would come
out. So I'm actually quite pleased about that.
The other important thing that I want to make sure that the audience hear is I think what 2022 did for us is it
increased the earnings power of the firm. And there's a lot of focus from these questions on kind of the charge-off
and peak charge-offs, but we've put on good assets consistent with what we've done historically. So, loans
increased $18 billion. So, there's going to be some seasoning, but overall, the earnings power of the firm has
increased as a result of great execution by our teams.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then again, just – I know this gets to CECL and the whole spirit of it. But given your
commentary and that you just indicated reserve flat, so if the macro outlook progresses within your scenarios and
the loss migration progresses as you described here into 2024 of this 2022 vintage, and no other surprises
elsewhere, then would you expect accordingly that the reserve at 660 would generally remain around that level in
14

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
that case? Or could there be incremental upside to the reserve, assuming that macro backdrop remains as they're
within the scenario bands?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So, I appreciate the question. A lot of assumptions in there. But as you laid out, I would expect the overall
reserve rates to be relatively close to kind of where they are today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, great. All right. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask if you could give
us a sense of what kind of delinquency rates you'd expect based on that 3.5% to 3.9% NCO rate outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes, I mean we don't typically forecast the delinquency rates. What I suggest you do is take a look at the trust
data and the relative difference between the trust data historically and where the total company is coming out, that
will give some insights.
And then also, the trends in delinquencies typically are pretty consistent, right? You can go point to point to point.
And then I've given some views in terms of where we see the slope starting to flatten and then perhaps bend. So
I'd use that information in order to – if you're interested in calculating overall [indiscernible] (00:46:35).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. I guess just the spirit of the question was there isn't anything unique happening
with that increase in charge-offs that would lead to a breakdown between the historical relationship that exists
between delinquencies and charge-offs. In other words, the sharp increase that you're expecting in delinquencies
– or sorry, in charge-offs, it would be reasonable to expect sort of a commensurate sharp increase in
delinquencies as the data starts to come through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes, there's obviously a relationship there, certainly. Although remember, you should take into account the kind of
the vintage impact and what I'll say normal seasoning, right? So, there's $18 billion of incremental loans. Some of
those are just going to perform extremely well and a small percentage will season out as we typically see. So I
would consider that in the analysis, but nothing...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
There should be no substantial breakdown.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And my follow-up is, if I may – I might have missed this, but why did an increase in early-stage
delinquencies drive higher credit card NCO rates this quarter? And so my initial thought was that early stage
delinquencies would have to flow through the various delinquency buckets before charging off. So I wasn't
following how that early stage increase this quarter impacted NCOs. Just a clarification there would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's a couple different components, right? There's a bankruptcy bucket. There's a non-
bankruptcy bucket that just flows through the buckets, and then there's also the recovery element. So you put
those three together, sometimes the bankruptcy bucket is – it will pop in a particular quarter, depending on flow of
work in a court system and the non-bankruptcy just flows quarter-over-quarter. So, I would certainly look at this
quarter, prior quarter and what comes out in the first quarter and that will give you the insights you're looking for.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just talk a little bit more about credit. So
specifically, I think you mentioned a little bit of mild deterioration in credit among the lower bands. Does your
guidance contemplate that stress spreading to your prime core revolver portfolio at all as unemployment
increases? I guess said differently, what I'm trying to understand is, do you think we go from credit normalization
to deterioration for DFS overall? Or is it just normalization with just the vintage seasoning impacts that we've been
talking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Thank you. It's the latter. It is normalization and seasoning, which we contemplated fully in both our kind of
origination strategy, our reserving strategy and obviously in the guidance we're providing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. And maybe just to clarify, the lowest income segments, which are a pretty small portion of our base, are the
ones that get additional pressure from inflation, right? By and large, a prime book can adjust. They trade down,
they readjust their pattern. So I think John was referring to incremental stress there. But there's no reason to
believe that the vast majority of our portfolio will be driven by the traditional drivers of losses, which is charge-offs
– I'm sorry, which is unemployment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then I did want to ask maybe a little bit of a big picture question, just longer term. I think – we
appreciate that you have added a lot of business and increased the earnings power because some of these
assets will obviously last a long time past the vintage seasoning, but the portfolio has changed a lot and your
guidance for the next year, and it sounds like potentially even 2024, is a little bit above where credit losses have
been running.
So maybe just remind us, what is the "normal" loss rate for DFS or for the card portfolio or something like that?
Maybe give us a range. Just trying to understand where a typical portfolio settles out. Is it in that 3%, low 3%
range, where does that settle out? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. Thanks, Mihir. So – we've been asked that question over the years many, many times. And what I typically
refer people back to is, if you take a look at the details of the kind of the charge-off history, you can go back
through 2008 and see kind of quarter-over-quarter what's happening on the charge-off front, you can discern kind
of normalized charge-off rate from that and then make adjustments for economic periods or kind of vintage-based
seasoning.

Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. In regards to your employment forecast and your base assumptions, you're pretty clear that the low
end, the 3.5% assumes the 4.5% to 5% unemployment rate. But can you help us understand or just confirm that
the – is it the 3.9% higher end of the range implying a 6% unemployment rate or some other scenario out there
within your expectations?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yes. So the high end does not weight the 6% entirely. It actually could reflect a scenario where the unemployment
is actually higher than the 6%, but it would depend on the depth of it and kind of what industry. So there's multiple
scenarios in there. So the guidance I provided in terms of 4.5% or over 6% is intended to kind of get the kind of
the meat of the scenarios that were contemplated and weighted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then with your baseline assumption of 4.5% to 5%, is that something that we make our way to
throughout the year and then maintain that level, or something where you expect it to peak there and then slowly
drift lower? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So it would run through – slowly increase through 2023 [ph] is (00:54:18) how we've thought about it.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. Can you dig in a little bit more on the credit card spend growth rate and kind of what you're
seeing in terms of any pattern changes? I think the last update through November showed a little bit of step-down
of the growth rate. And can you talk about December and I think maybe you touched on January?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'll start. January is off to a very strong start. So we're seeing about a 13% year-over-year growth in sales,
and again, reflects the new accounts we put on last year, but also, again, for those who [ph] are (00:55:05)
employed, a robust environment.
We have been seeing increases in the day-to-day category commensurate with inflation and so more spending
shifting there. And a lot of what you heard from retailers in terms of softness around home improvement and hard
goods, but a lot of that was just, I think, some of the challenging comparisons to really robust levels from before.
So overall, I'd say stable, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing so far in January.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. On the marketing outlook, you had indicated that you expect to spend more than 2022 levels, which
obviously was a very strong acquisition year for you. What's the thought process there in terms of expecting to
increase spend after such a strong year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great question. And you know what, I'm going to kind of give an overview on expenses and then I'll
specifically talk about kind of marketing and our thinking there. So we said overall expenses would increase less
than 10%. So what that contemplates is a double-digit increase in marketing and single digits for the non-
marketing spend. And what that reflects is, we continue to see opportunities to acquire profitable new accounts
that are consistent with what we do so that – in that prime revolver category.
We also are intending to spend some money on the launch of the debit checking product. So that will include
dollars for new accounts as well as advertising to bring awareness to the product. And then it's important to also
kind of have a view on the marketing in that this is our guidance. If we see the macroeconomic environment
change or we don't see ample opportunity to spend this money wisely, then we will make calls in terms of the
level of spend and it could be less than what we've guided to. But overall, we're very, very pleased with kind of
our targeting and the effectiveness of the marketing and gave us confidence to continue to increase that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. And then on the personal loan side, you had indicated that it's clear that it's performing better than
historically. With respect to the guidance, does the personal loan net charge-off rate, is that expected to go as
high as credit cards in 2023? Or are you still expecting it to be somewhat better?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'm going to stick at the top level of the guidance we provided. And then we give details by product in the
supplement. I would use that information and impute kind of the charge-off rate there. But again, product has
been performing very, very well, loss rates significantly below kind of what's happening out in the industry and it's
a prime customer set. So that should give a view of kind of at least a way to think about expectations for that
product.
