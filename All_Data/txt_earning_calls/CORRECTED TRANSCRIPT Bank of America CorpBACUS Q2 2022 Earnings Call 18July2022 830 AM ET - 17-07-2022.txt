Brian T. Moynihan
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and thank you, all of you, for joining us today. This quarter, thanks to a great team here at Bank
of America, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered on our fourth straight
quarter of operating leverage. We grew revenue 6% while expense rose 1.5% for 4.5% of operating leverage
compared to quarter two 2021. We also saw a 21% year-over-year improvement in NII. These earnings generated
return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points.
As a reminder. When comparing our earnings in the second quarter of 2021 to the earnings this quarter, in the
second quarter of 2021, we recorded two items of note. In that quarter, net income benefited by $2 billion from a
tax adjustment for a UK tax law change, and that was worth $0.23 to EPS. We also released $2.2 billion in credit
reserves during that quarter that benefited earnings by $1.7 billion or $0.19 in EPS. This will bring that quarter's
reported EPS of $1.03 down to the low-60s and that compares to this quarter's $0.73 per share.
This gain is illustrated by the increase in pre-tax, pre-provision income, which would exclude those two impacts,
and that was $7.4 billion this quarter, improving 15% in PPNR improvement from the second quarter of 2021.
So, let's go to slide 3 and let's talk about some of the drivers of results. The organic growth engine at Bank of
America that existed pre-pandemic is back in full place here, and you can see that in the second quarter of 2021.
This reflects in net new checking account openings, net new consumer investment accounts, net new household
growth in Wealth Management, very strong loan growth across all products and good performance by Global
Markets and investment banking teams even given a quarter with volatile capital markets.
Our expense management continues strong and it benefits by the best digital banking platform in the world. Once
again, we drove more users, saw more log-ins and usage, and that generated 20% more sales from the platform
compared to last year. Our asset quality remains very strong, with net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2021
still 50% below pre-pandemic levels in late 2019 when credit was pretty good.
Breaking down the performance by segment, I'd make a few comments. Our Consumer Banking segment
continue to see good momentum, as we grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years. We added
more than 240,000 net new checking accounts in the quarter in the second quarter alone. We opened new
financial centers and renovated others, and deepened digital engagement with both consumer and small business
clients. And after considering the highly elevated consumer income tax outflows, payments of taxes, which is
good for government, we saw good deposit activity.
In our Wealth Management segment, in a period of declining market values where stocks and bonds had the
worst first half in five decades, revenues still grew in that business 7% year-over-year, and we expanded our pre-
tax margin. Our Banking business [ph] we had clients that overcame (00:05:05) those market values and
weakness. We added more than 5,100 net new households across Merrill and Private Bank. Across our entire
wealth platform, Merrill, the Private Bank and our consumer investments team, Merrill Lynch, client balances,
including deposits, investments and loans, totals $3.8 trillion at 06/30/2022, aided by nearly $150 billion of client
inflows over the last year into those businesses.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Our Global Banking team grew loans 5% linked quarter. That's 5% in a single quarter, 20% annualized. We also
saw global Treasury Services revenue, as customers utilized our service [ph] to manage their (00:05:43) quality,
stand up well in the quarter. Overall, revenue in Global Banking was impacted by the weaker investment banking
fees that were available in this volatile market. Lower investment banking fees and we also had marks, as
previously discussed, to our leveraged finance positions. Our NII improvement nearly offset all those impacts,
leaving revenue only modestly down year-over-year. We maintained our number three investment banking market
share ranking.
In Markets, we had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, growing 11% from last year, ex DVA. Our macro
FICC business, where we have been investing over the last couple of years, performed well, as did the equity
derivatives, while other FICC businesses felt the effects of spread widening and customers taking a more risk-off
position.
From a broader enterprise, our P&L perspective, quarter two expense was down modestly from quarter one, and
consistent with what we told you on our last call. It is notable that we achieved that even as quarter-two included
approximately $425 million in regulatory matters that Alastair will discuss in a few minutes. As I said earlier, one of
the reasons we continue to have good expense results and continued progress on digital engagement across the
businesses. I [ph] command (00:06:58) you to look at slides 22, 27, and 29 in our appendix where we set forth our
digital operating results by lines of business.
Overall digital sales continued to grow, up 20%. Digital choice for payments continued to grow. Zelle transactions
continued to out-distance checks written, crossing over last year and the gap continues to widen. Erica is
approaching 1 billion interactions since we started with it. Clients have filled out 8 million life plans, enhancing our
asset growth and account retention. That's one of the fastest growing product implementations we've had.
It is also worth noting the strong credit quality. Most all of that asset quality metrics improved again this quarter.
You will note, however, the charge-offs rose in quarter two, but this increase was largely due to some loan sale
accounting and some other credit decisions due to the past pandemic issues.
As I've done for several quarters, I want to make a few points about customer activity. Let's go to slide 4. By our
data across the 35 million core checking households plus we have in 60 million consumers in America, US
consumers remain quite resilient. I would offer a few thoughts as you look at slide 4. In addition, I'll give you what
we see so far in July in a moment.
First, consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as quite some time has passed since the receipt of
any stimulus. Second, the overall average deposit balances for most client cohorts are higher than they were both
last quarter and even rose in June versus May. They remain at multiples above the pre-pandemic levels and,
importantly, we're seeing no deterioration in our customers' asset quality and they have the capability to borrow.
Our customer data shows Bank of America customers spend at the highest quarterly period on record in quarter,
two at $1.1 trillion in total spending, that's up 12% year-over-year. This quarter also was the highest debit
spending period on record for us. But as you think about more recently, just to give you the more recent statistics,
in June 2022, spending was up 11.3% over June 2021. Transactions also rose more than 6%. For the first two
weeks of July, the spending is up 10%-plus and transactions again rising 6%-plus. This is strong consumer
resilience.
We continued to see shifts in what people are spending on as the quarter took place more on experiences, travel,
and things like that and a bit â€“ and bit more on fuel due to increased prices and less on retail stores. In quarter
4

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
two, we saw that higher gas spend as well as a continued recovery in the travel categories, and continued
recovery in restaurant spending.
On the lower-right hand chart, you'll note the continued shift in how people spend money. [ph] As (00:09:55)
check and cash volumes continue to come down and are replaced by digital alternatives. This continues to help
on our cost structure.
Regarding our customer liquidity, average deposit balance of our customers remained at high levels relative to the
year ago and pre-pandemic periods. They are largely unchanged for the mass market customers. They rose
about 1% over June from May. The only area where we had any change to the negative was a small dip, 1%, for
the most affluent segments of those customers. That reflects the tax payments made in April and the build back
coming more slowly for those customers.
In addition to this data, I'll refer you to slides 24 and 25, which completes the resiliency picture. This shows you
strong asset quality across our consumers. Also look at elevated payment rates on credit cards. That means
people paying off their debt at a good clip. There's no real differentiation across the trends in â€“ of customer
cohorts. Even for the very small portion of our card book, there is a lower credit quality. So, while this is good
news, it clearly makes the Fed's job tougher when you take these statistics and this activity and combine it with
low unemployment rate.
I want to switch gears now and talk a little bit more about credit. We've provided more information on credit this
quarter, as would be obvious given the debate about a future recession. [ph] While there's (00:11:17) debate and
discuss this potential outcome, we just continue to drive responsible growth at our company and so we're
prepared.
So, if you look at slide 5, you can see how much the loan book has changed under more than a decade of
Responsible Growth. As you can see on the top-left chart, our loan book is quite well-balanced now between
consumer and commercial loans. Focusing on the top-right chart, note that the Consumer portfolio is even more
collateralized with a greater mix of mortgage and less card. In addition, much less second mortgage, and
obviously second mortgages today underwritten clearly differently than they were in the mid-2000 â€“ 2000 to 2010
decade. And all Consumer portfolios have much higher FICOs. In the bottom-left chart, you'll note the more
diversified commercial mix as well. And if you look at the lower-right chart, you can see our results on the stress
test and how they fared time and time again.
When you go to slide 6, we gave you a little detail on what we look like in the height of last crisis compared to
where we are now. You can see the loan portfolio in 2009 when risk were at the peak for Bank of America
because this was after we'd closed the Merrill and the Countrywide transactions, and the company was all put
together. We give you those metrics what they look like pre-pandemic at the end of 2019 and what they look like
today. On the right are the changes we've made under that decade-plus of Responsible Growth.
Given all these changes, 92% of our commercial loan book today is either investment grade or secured. And
while there is not much difference in something like the commercial real estate book, you have to look underlying
to see the changes. For instance, the land development loans have decreased from $5 billion in 2009 to $200
million currently, and secured residential exposure decreased from $11 billion to $150 million now.
We've also included a few slides on our appendix, pages 23 to 25, that highlight the consumer resilience and
delinquency points as well as the consumer lending statistics, highlighting this continued strong quality of all our
originations. Take note of the FICOs on this newly originated activity there. So, in the end, despite the worries of a
5

slowing economy and other global issues, client activity remained good this quarter. NII has improved quickly, and
our customers' resilience and health remains strong.
We recognized some expense from regulatory matters and still managed to keep expenses flat to the first quarter
and in line with what we told you. We continue to drive strong operating leverage in a weaker capital markets
environment. These earnings are delivering strong returns and delivering capital back to shareholders. In thinking
about capital, remember: First, we use our capital to support customers and related loans and we continue to
invest in the franchise. Second, we are delivering capital back to you as shareholders. We now intend to increase
our dividend in quarter three which would have our dividend 22% higher than it was just 12 months ago. In
addition, we retired shares this quarter.
Third, we're going to be building capital given the new higher minimums received during the stress test. It'll make
our balance sheet even stronger. Along the way, we believe our expected earnings generation over the next 18
months will provide an ample amount of capital which allows us to support customer growth, pay dividends and
use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian. And since Brian hit the highlights of the income statement, I just want to reiterate we saw good
returns in the quarter with return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points.
So, I'm going to begin my comments on slide 7 and the balance sheet. And as you can see, during the quarter,
the balance sheet declined $127 billion to a little more than $3.1 trillion, and that reflected an $88 billion decline in
deposits and a decrease in our Global Markets balance sheet. We utilized a combination of cash and some
rotation from securities this quarter to fund our loans growth given the decline in deposits.
Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting a drop in deposits and lower securities valuation,
and it remains very elevated at nearly $1 trillion. For reference, that was $576 billion pre-pandemic, just to give
you an idea of how much liquidity has increased over the period.
Shareholders' equity increased $2.5 billion from Q1 with a few different components we should note.
Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $5.9 billion and the issuance of $2
billion in preferred stock. So, that's $7.9 billion flowing into equity. We paid out $2.2 billion in common dividends
and net share repurchases.
AOCI declined as a result of the increase in loan rates, and we saw that impact in two ways: First, we had a
reduction from a change in the value of our available-for-sale debt securities of $1.8 billion, and that impacts
CET1. Second, rates also drove a $2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives that does not impact CET1. And that
reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that provided
some NII growth and also protected CET1 at the same time. With that equity growth, we saw book value increase
in the quarter.
With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased 10 basis points to 5.5% versus our
minimum requirement of 5%, leaving plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains
comfortably above our requirements.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Okay. Let's turn to slide 8, and we'll talk about CET1, where our capital levels remain very strong. We have $172
billion of CET1, and a 10.5% CET1 ratio, which increased from the first quarter and remains well above our
second quarter 9.5% minimum requirement. That 10.5% CET1 ratio is also expected to be just above our new
10.4% requirement from CCAR when it's confirmed by regulators at the end of August. And that new level will be
effective for us on October 1.
I'll walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter. First, $5.9 billion of earnings net of preferred dividends,
which generated 36 basis points of capital. And looking at the chart, you can see how we use that. We grew loans
by $38 billion. And with a decline in our Global Markets balance sheet and some loan sales and other balance
sheet initiatives, we were able to hold RWA flat this quarter.
Second, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 16 basis points. Third, this quarter, the
movement in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused a decline in the fair value of our available-
for-sale debt securities, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 11 basis points. And we remained well-positioned for
that rate movement as our hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continued to protect it from AOCI movements.
So, we ended the quarter above our expected minimum of 10.4% required October 1, and we expect to build
some additional buffer on top of that in Q3.
Moving beyond the third quarter, we should just remind you, our balance sheet growth last year means our G-SIB
surcharge and CET1 requirement will move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024. And I just want to make
sure we repeat that for clarity, it's 2024 because I know others have different timelines for their requirements.
Given our additional higher G-SIB minimum, over the next six quarters, we'll work to move above that expected
CET1 minimum of 10.9% by January 1, 2024, and we'll look to exceed that with another 50 basis points of internal
management buffer on top of that requirement.
Okay. So, now, let's talk about the biggest use of CET1 this quarter, and I'm referring to loans on slide 9. As you
review the average loan data, we just want to remind you that our discipline around Responsible Growth has
remained tight. Average loans have climbed back over $1 trillion. They're up 12% compared to Q2 2021, led by
commercial growth of 15% and complemented by Consumer growth of 8%. Each line of business and product
segment reflected good growth, and geographic and industry participation within that growth has also broadened
over the past several quarters.
As we turn to linked quarter comparisons, I'll use ending balances, and the $25 billion linked-quarter commercial
improvement came mostly from new loans and also included some improved utilization from existing clients. From
an asset quality standpoint, 98% of the commercial loan growth was either investment grade or secured.
Consumer loans grew $10 billion linked-quarter, led by both credit card and mortgage, and also increases in auto
and securities-based lending. And for the first time in years, home equity balances increased modestly. Card
loans grew $5 billion from Q1, reflecting healthy spend levels, even as payments rates remain elevated.
Within our growth, our average FICO was 771, as you can see on slide 23 in the appendix. And as we've done in
the past, in the appendix on slide 32, we provided that daily ending loan chart that shows trends through the
quarter. And you can see both commercial and consumer loans balances are now back to pre-pandemic periods
with really only credit cards still remaining 15% to 20% below that period.
Moving to deposits on slide 10, across our past 12 months, we've seen solid growth across the client base as
we've deepened relationships and added new accounts. Some of the year-over-year growth was impacted by a
7


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
higher level of tax payments across Consumer and GWIM clients and businesses in Q2 of this year. Those
elevated tax payments drove the decline in deposits from Q1.
Year-over-year average deposits were up $123 billion or 7%, and retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth
Management clients grew $129 billion, and we believe our retail deposits of $1.4 trillion continue to lead all
competitors.
Within the Consumer balances, I'd just like to point out the Small Business deposits of $177 billion grew 14%
year-over-year, and that reflects continued reopening of small businesses across America and the consumer
spending supporting their growth. The average balance of these accounts is more than $40,000. On Wealth
Management, we saw clients paying higher tax bills this year, and we saw some move deposits to market-based
funds, much of which remained in our own complex.
With our commercial clients, deposits were up modestly year-over-year, even as customer tax payments are
higher this year. And some have recently begun to seek higher yields and use cash strategically for acquisitions
and other operational activities.
Turning to slide 9 (sic) [11] and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $12.4 billion and
the FTE net interest income number was $12.5 billion. Focusing on FTE, NII increased $2.2 billion from the
second quarter of last year, or 21%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates including lower
premium amortization and loans growth.
NII compared to the first quarter rose $870 million, and that came in a good bit higher than the $650 million-plus
that we signaled on our last earnings call. The benefits of higher rates, lower premium amortization, loans growth,
and the additional day of interest more than offset the impact of lower securities balances.
Our net interest yield was 1.86%, improving 17 basis points from Q1 and benefited from the rise in rates, loans
growth funded with cash, and a 4 basis point improvement from lower premium amortization and securities.
Looking forward, we want to provide the following NII guidance, and we just have to provide a few caveats. First,
we base the guidance on interest rates in the forward curve materializing, and I'm referring to the curve on July
15. Second, we assume modest growth in loans and deposits. And third, we assume deposit betas reflecting
disciplined pricing to achieve our growth.
If those assumptions hold true, we can see NII in Q3 increase by at least $900 million, possibly $1 billion, versus
Q2. And then, we expect it to grow again at a faster pace on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. And the way
we think about those NII increases, given the expense discipline that we have, is we expect the majority of that to
fall to the bottom line for shareholders.
Focusing on asset sensitivity for a moment, as you know, we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a
100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that forward basis, asset
sensitivity at June 30 was $5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months. More than 90% of that is driven by
short rates. That's down from $5.4 billion at March 31, largely because the benefit of higher rates is now already
factored into our baseline of actual NII after we grew the $870 million.
Now, given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next couple of meetings, we
thought it was also appropriate to provide the disclosure again regarding asset sensitivity on a spot basis. And on
8


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
a spot basis, our sensitivity to a 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.8 billion, or $800 million
higher than the forward basis at June 30.
Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use slide 12. Our expenses were $15.3 billion, up a couple hundred million,
or 1.5% from the year-ago period and down modestly compared to the first quarter. I want to focus on the more
recent comparison versus the first quarter. We had higher expense for regulatory matters related to certain
issues, and those offset the seasonal decline from the first quarter elevated payroll taxes and revenue-related
incentive costs.
Let me pause for a moment on the $425 million expense we've recognized for regulatory matters in the second
quarter. A little more than half of the amount related to fines to resolve regulatory investigations relating to our
administration of prepaid unemployment benefit card programs in certain states and that we announced last
week. The balance of the expense relates to an industry-wide issue, and it concerns the use of unapproved
personal devices, and that has not yet been fully resolved.
As we look forward more broadly on expenses, we continue to invest heavily in technology, in people and in
marketing across the businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers and renovated old ones in
expansion and new growth markets. To help pay for those investments, we continue to look for opportunities to
simplify our processes and reduce work, driving our costs lower to self-fund our new investments.
Our head count this quarter includes roughly 2,300 summer interns, and we hope they will consider us to be a
great place to work and join us full-time next year. This is the most diverse group of talent we've seen yet. Absent
the addition of those interns, our head count was down a little more than 700 associates. And we, like many other
companies, are doing many things to tackle challenging labor market conditions, and we're meeting that challenge
pretty well so far.
Turning to asset quality on slide 13, I want to repeat what we've said now for many, many quarters. The asset
quality of our customers remains very healthy, and that's true in both consumer and commercial. So, net charge-
offs of $571 million increased $179 million from Q1, driven by loan sales and some other credit decisions that we
made as opposed to core credit deterioration. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were down modestly
compared to the year-ago period and up slightly from Q1.
Provision expense was $523 million in Q2, driven by the charge-offs, as we had a small reserve release of $48
million. And that release includes builds for loan growth, it includes builds for a dampened macroeconomic
outlook in the future, and the builds were offset by continued asset quality improvement and the effect of reduced
pandemic uncertainty.
On slide 14, we're highlighting the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and a
couple of things are worth repeating again this quarter. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic
levels, and you can see the decline in reservable criticized. And NPLs saw a modest decrease, driven both by the
loan sales mentioned earlier and other improvement across commercial.
Turning to the business segments, let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 15. And the Consumer Bank earned
$2.9 billion on good organic growth, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of operating leverage. Strong top line
growth of 12%, driven by net interest income improvement, was more than offset by increase in provision
expense resulting from the prior year's much larger reserve release. And while reported earnings were down, pre-
tax, pre-provision earnings for Consumer grew 26% year-over-year, which highlights the earnings improvement
without the impact of that reserve action.

Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year, as spending benefits were mostly offset by
higher rewards costs. Service charges were down nearly $200 million year-over-year, as our previously
announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by June. The third quarter will reflect
the full run rate going forward, and we believe these changes are helping to improve overall customer satisfaction
and further lower customer attrition.
Expense increased 2%, as much of our increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer
Banking the most, and as revenue grew, we improved the efficiency ratio to 54%. Reduced costs associated with
continued shifts in client behavior to digital engagement is also allowing us to invest in higher marketing, more
technology and higher wages for our people. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening
another 19 in the quarter, while we renovated 157 more.
Notable customer activity highlights included 240,000 net new checking accounts opened in the second quarter
and marking the 14th consecutive quarter of net new Consumer checking account growth. This led to a record 35
million consumer checking accounts, with 92% of them considered to be their primary account. Additionally, Small
Business accounts are enjoying the features of their Business Advantage rewards and showed growth of 5% from
last year.
We also grew investment accounts 6% year-over-year, and not surprisingly, the market impacted customer
balances negatively on the investment side. At the same time, over the past 12 months, we've seen $21 billion of
positive client inflows. Lastly, once again, we opened over 1 million credit cards in the quarter, and we grew
average active card accounts and saw combined credit and debit card spend up 10%. And as you saw earlier, we
had solid lending activity with continued low loss rates.
Our 43 million active digital users signed on this quarter a record 2.8 billion times, with our Erica users up 30%
year-over-year, and we captured over 123 million total client interactions in the second quarter alone. You can
see all the other digital metrics and trends on slide 26.
Turning to Wealth Management on slide 16, you can see we produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion and
producing 16% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth was 7%, as NII generated through our banking
assistance for these clients more than offset modest declines in assets under management fees from market
impacts during a challenging quarter.
Clients and advisors recognized this value of a holistic financial relationship across investments and banking and
doing that at Bank of America differentiates both Merrill and the Private Bank and it helps to diversify and
differentiate our earnings in this business compared to other brokers.
Our talented group of financial advisors, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain
nearly 4,500 net new households. We also gained 650 more in the Private Bank this quarter, and that's a very
solid showing by both given the complexities of serving our clients in challenging market conditions over the past
90 days.
We added $25 billion of loans over the last year, growing 13%, and marking 49 consecutive quarters of loans
growth in the business, and that is consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows and
deposit growth were a little more muted this quarter, as clients paid taxes, impacting the quarter-to-quarter
comparison. Year-over-year, our deposits were up $17 billion and overall investment flows were $78 billion over
10

the past four quarters, with total flows of $110 billion. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher employee-related
costs and resulted in operating leverage of 6%.
Turning to slide 17 and Global Banking, you'll see the business earned $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down
$918 million year-over-year and driven [ph] by (00:35:50) the absence of a large prior-period reserve release and
lower investment banking revenue. As you know, it was a tough comparative quarter for the business, as the
industry investment banking fee pool declined 50%. And while we acknowledge that's a big drop, we just want to
remind you that before the pandemic, our quarterly average for investment banking fees was in the range of $1.3
billion to $1.5 billion compared to the $1.1 billion we put up in the second quarter. So, we view this level as
temporary and we believe it can rise back to more normal levels in the next few quarters when economic
uncertainty becomes more muted.
While the company's overall investment banking fees declined, we held on to our number three ranking in overall
fees, and we maintained our market share through the first half of the year compared to 2021. At the same time,
we saw very strong loans growth. Ending loans grew $18 billion linked quarter and are up $62 billion or 19% year-
over-year. That loans growth and higher rates drove net interest income growth, which was able to offset the drop
in investment banking fees, leaving revenues in the business fairly flat year-over-year.
Also impacting revenue was half of the firm's $300 million leveraged finance valuation marks. The market turmoil
and abrupt slowdown in the second quarter sparked a downturn in the leveraged finance markets causing a
number of the deals across various market participants to get marked down. Some of those deals have been
funded, and we're working through any remaining exposure to get them through the market.
The provision expense increase reflects a reserve build of $143 million in Q2 compared to an $834 million release
in the year-ago period. And finally, we saw expenses increase by 8%, driven by higher personnel costs and a
share of the noted expenses for regulatory matters.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 18, and as we usually do, we'll talk about the segment results excluding
DVA. Second quarter net income of $900 million reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue. It was
another quarter that favored macro trading while the credit trading businesses faced a more challenging market
environment with widening spreads in the face of increased inflation fears and recession beliefs.
Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4 billion to revenue, improving 11%. FICC was up
19%, while equities was up 2%. That FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products,
while credit-traded products were down. We've been investing heavily over the past year in several of the macro
businesses identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded for that this quarter.
Our strength in equities was driven by good performance in derivatives and offset by a weaker trading
performance in cash. Lastly, also impacting revenue was the other half of the firm's $300 million in leveraged
finance markdowns. Year-over-year expense declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the
realignment of a liquidating business activity, partially offset by that share of the regulatory costs. Absent these
impacts, expense was relatively unchanged. And the business generated an 8% return in Q2, impacted by both
the elevated leveraged finance marks and regulatory matter expense.
Finally, on slide 19, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $318 million, declining from the year-ago period,
driven by the prior-period $2 billion tax benefit from that UK tax law change. Revenue is roughly a couple of
hundred million higher than Q2 2021 due to the absence of some prior-period structured note losses.

Expense increased as a result of the regulatory matters and the realignment of liquidating activity last year to All
Other. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments all are
taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax
credits and any other unusual items.
For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 9%. That benefited from two things: first, ESG investment tax credits;
and second, roughly $300 million of discrete tax benefits were applied to this quarter. Excluding those tax credits
and discrete items, our tax rate would have been 26%.
And with that, we'll jump into Q&A, please. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So, I'm looking at all your credit metrics improving and a modest reserve release in the
quarter, and everything you said about Responsible Growth, it's all great. But my question is, how do you balance
making sure that you're not looking too much in the back â€“ the rearview mirror and see where we came from
versus what we're going towards, and people's obvious concerns about the go-forward and the economy. And
maybe within that, let's just talk about what leading indicators you'd look at that drive, say, if you thought about
putting up a CECL reserve on the go-forward. You don't sound that concerned, but like, a lot of [ph] office
(00:41:54) people looking at a recession here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Glenn, thanks for the question. Remember that the reserve methodology is a forward-looking methodology, and
our core scenario is weighted part to the baseline, part to the adverse, and ends up â€“ just to give you a sense â€“
with the unemployment rate this year in the actual reserve-setting scenario, not an adverse case, but the actual,
when we set the reserves [ph] with (00:42:20) 5% unemployment within the next five months, so [ph] 3.6%
(00:42:24) to 5%. So, there's a conservative aspect to how the reserves are set. And so, basically, the high quality
of the loan book is not only what we talk about and show you all the stats, and you can assess and look at, but
also, you can look at the stress test results on a relative 10% unemployment overnight, yada, yada, yada, and you
see all the different statistics there and you see that on page 5 or 6 or whatever [ph] is the (00:42:51) slide, you
can see us lower than everybody else's. That's because many, many years of Responsible Growth and why we
showed you those pages comparing the different points in time.
And so, I think â€“ you said something, our reserve is not set looking backwards, it's set looking forward based on
the books, based on the CECL methodology. We even do a comparison to where CECL day one, as we call, what
happened then, and it's consistent, it's consistent, it's just the credit quality book continues to improve, honestly.

I love the Seinfeld reference. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up. On RWA, you didn't seem to need to do
much. I appreciate the comments you made on the prepared remarks. So, the question I have is, there seems to
be a much higher intent across the Street to mitigate RWA, for obvious reasons. Everybody's capital requirements
are going up. So, the question I have for you is how do you balance [indiscernible] (00:43:55) a belt tightening
versus using your okay relative capital position to continue to grow while others are tightening the belt. Thanks so
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Glenn. So, obviously, we're in a little different place in than we have the capital already, and we feel like
over the course of the past several years, we've been quite disciplined around our RWAs. It just remains
important for us to stay at it.
So, you saw us do a couple of things this quarter. We sold a portfolio of loans that were non-core. We've changed
a little bit in terms of â€“ as some of the 20% risk-weighted assets in our securities portfolio are rolling off, we can
replace them with 0% risk-weighted, like Treasuries with essentially the same yield at this point. So, you saw what
we did this quarter. We grew loans, we built capital, we created some RWA flex in the background, and we think
we can do the same going forward.

Jim Mitchell Q

Maybe just if I look at the â€“ you're still projecting relatively healthy asset sensitivity even with the forward curve at
a high level, so doesn't â€“ I think when I look at the comparison versus the spot, it implies not a real big
degradation in betas in the forward versus the spot. So, can you discuss how you think about deposit betas as
Fed funds gets above 300 basis points? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, we talked about â€“ the last time we were together, we talked about the fact we're looking backwards to
2015 to 2019, and you saw what our deposit beta was. At the time, it was in that sort of low-20s-percent, and we
said we hope to do better. We have done better than that so far.

Now, just as a reminder, generally speaking, we think about how we price so that we grow deposits, and that
growth last year was 7%. We're expecting growth this year than â€“ and we said in the low-single digits, but we're
going to have to see how the rate structure develops. We've been pretty clear on that as well, and we're going to
be competing in the market with others, so we just have to watch that develop over time.
The core operating balances. Consumer, we continue to add there over time, and if we're seeing kind of run-off,
Jim, it's really only in the very high end of Wealth Management. And it's in the non-operating balances in
commercial. So, we're keeping a tight eye on it, but our NII reflects what we think a reasonable assumptions
around deposit pricing.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
...so just to clarify â€“ oh, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Jim, just look at page 10 and you can see. If you look at the upper-right hand corner and see the size of the non-
interest-bearing and interest checking, which is different than when it moves, and you think about that even in the
Wealth Management deposits on the lower left, and then in the operating deposits in the commercial book, we
just have a â€“ a lot of these deposits that are money and movement in the household. And we've gone through this
discussion a lot a few years ago. And so, they're very [ph] insensitive (00:47:25) rates only because the money is
always moving and it's just the average collected balances in these households as opposed to money that's for
investment purposes, which will move. And you saw it move a little bit in the Wealth Management business this
quarter. And some of the corporates will continue to position them for more investment-oriented cash for lack of
better term. And so, we'd expect that to occur, but I think history is some guide here.
But also, at the end of the day, we've grown 1 million new checking accounts year-over-year. So â€“ and that brings
in more and more stable core checking balances, which don't move around much. And so, think about all that.
We've been through it before. And as rates go up, the stuff that moves due to rate is relatively modest, and we
have a huge bucket of non-interest-bearing that sits with us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. So, I mean, clearly you guys have a high-quality deposit base. So, I think the implication is even though
we're 300 basis points, you think betas can stay sort of in that well under 50% range.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We tell our team to price consistently so they can grow faster â€“ slightly faster than the market. They've been
growing a lot faster than the market because of the [indiscernible] (00:48:35) stimulus and stuff like that. [ph] But
that's (00:48:38) even the market, they were growing much faster. But that's what we tell them. And so, we don't
do things to hurt the franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. And then on the capital side, just trying to get a sense of how quickly you want to get to a buffer and how to
think about a buffer on your â€“ whether it's 2024 minimum or 2023, can you still do some buybacks between now
and then?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we already have a modest buffer relative to what we expect at the end of October. And then we've got,
obviously, future capital generation and we've got some balance sheet optimization we can do. So, we feel like
we've got a lot of flexibility. So, we feel like we've got some ability to do some share repurchase.
And then in terms of where we end up, I'd say go â€“ fast forward to January of 2024, that's when we get the next
50 basis point step-up. So, we're going to generate that 50 basis points over the next six quarters. So, we think
we'll have some ability to do a little bit of everything.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Hi. Well, thanks for the NII guide. I guess my question â€“ well, first, I'm â€“ if we're going to be here, it's probably
January 18, 2023, two quarters from now, we'll be on the earnings call and we'll see if your guidance is correct or
not. And I know you don't want to give guidance that you don't meet, but you just guided for almost $2 billion in
higher NII in the next two quarters, implying an $8 billion uptick in the annualized run rate for NII. I just want to
make sure I heard that correctly.
And then on your definition of majority of that should fall to the bottom line, how do you define majority? Is that
50.1%, or is it more than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, I'll answer the question. Yes, I think you're right. We said $900 million to $1 billion this quarter coming up and
then at least that the following quarter. So, yes, you're right to think about that as a couple billion. We'll get a little
more precise with fourth quarter as we get to, obviously, a quarter from now.
And with respect to falling to the bottom line, I'd say that's going to be the vast majority, but I'll leave that to Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I think, Mike, we're bouncing around $15 billion to $15.5 billion of quarterly operating costs. And you can
look backwards and see that, that's been fairly constant. And so, you'd expect that to continue. And so the vast,
vast majority falls to the bottom line. It's [ph] now (00:51:24) the business model. And you know, Mike, as well as
anybody that revenue comes through the businesses that don't need to add people or activity to get the value of
it, i.e., the Consumer business and Wealth Management business, commercial banking business. And you saw
that year-over-year. And as much as it's a strong projection going forward, we captured like $2 billion last year
second quarter, this year second quarter, and I think a lot of it fell to the bottom line on an apples-to-apples basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I mean â€“ just as one follow-up, and look, you've changed the firm since the global financial crisis when the
company over-promised and under-delivered, and you've really gone out of your way to under-promise and over-
deliver. And so when you say a phrase like vast, vast majority, don't you want to hedge a little bit? I mean, you
have a lot of inflationary pressures, you're hearing talk about it's harder to hire people, harder to retain people,
you have rents, you have all sorts of things happening here, and you're saying vast, vast majority of the additional
revenues should fall to the bottom line. Any hedging at all you'd like to give here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, basically, I don't â€“ I'd look at that quarter-to-quarter linkage. It's expenses of $15.3 billion, and NII, we told
you, was up â€“ what did we say, $650 million last quarter [ph] turned to $850 million â€“ yeah (00:52:46). So, we
exceeded our estimates. That's why we [ph] stayed (00:52:49) in the next couple of quarters because we've got a
pretty good line of sight to those, Mike. So, we feel pretty good about it.
The question that you ask â€“ all of you kept asking last quarter is how you do this and keep investing in the
franchise. So, we increased marketing, we added people in the places we wanted to add people and took people
out of the places we didn't need them so much. We continue to add new branches in the many cities and towns
that we didn't have the branch structure and reposition. In other words, we invested this quarter $800 million in
16

technology co-development that got implemented. And so â€“ but the confidence in the next quarter, frankly, is â€“ it's
already three weeks in almost, and it's pretty well set up, so we feel pretty good.

Two questions. First is just on the investments that you're making in expanding your market share and capital
markets activities. You've, obviously, made a decision to do that and it's panned out, and I wanted to understand
at this stage, given the higher SCB that you have, will you still be leaning into investing and looking to take more
share in the capital markets-related businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. They're largely â€“ as Jimmy DeMare would say, [ph] it's (00:54:22) the so-called growth plan we talked
about starting almost two-and-a-half years ago was implemented, and which we increased the size of the balance
sheet. And you can see a little bit on page 18, trading-related assets, but you'd have to go back a quarter â€“ a year
before that and see if they've increased.
And so, he's built the balance sheet up to the size he thinks is relevant. We've built the product capabilities out.
He continues to hire people in certain areas. And so, we feel pretty good that we're pretty well-built. It's just that
we've done it and market times have got pretty interesting pretty fast. And that being said, if you look at the
trading revenue sort of first half of the year over the last three years has been relatively stable at $8 billion [ph] I'm
not sure, (00:55:04) something like that. So, he's done a good job. They built it up. And so, it doesn't need another
big hump â€“ chunk of balance sheet on top of that. It's really in pretty good shape now, and so its relative size [ph]
in the platform is (00:55:17) pretty well set.

Good morning. Just to follow up on the expenses, how are you thinking about costs in the back half of the year?

So, we haven't changed much, Matt, in terms of the way we think about running the company. Brian mentioned
already, if you look at the last six quarters, we're sort of running the place right around $15 billion out of sight. So
we still feel like that's the right place, that $60 billion flattish year-over-year. And then I just â€“ I just make sure you
back out and add that reg matter. That's all.

So, on the resi mortgage side, we sold an old portfolio of residential mortgages that we put in All Other some
number of years ago. So this allowed us an opportunity just to exit that. We do that periodically anyway, but in this
case, it was about $3.3 billion I want to say, and we did have a loss, so you see that loss running through. But just
so you're aware, it was largely offset by a gain somewhere else. So, I wouldn't think about it as much of an
economic loss, but it did temporarily inflate the charge-offs, which is why we called it out. And then there were a
couple other things in there that related to write-downs around pandemic and stimulus and offsets with overdraft,
but again, not what I would consider to be anywhere near the core Consumer credit portfolio that we run.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to keep on Mike's theme of under-promising and over-delivering. So I'm going to
try and ask the NII question another way. Alastair, one of your peers has started to frame NII with regards to an
exit rate in the fourth quarter. So â€“ and then, as I'm just thinking about the rate sensitivity in the forward curve and
your comments about loans and deposits and deposit repricing, obviously, you're alluding to $13.5 billion by third
quarter. Is it possible by the fourth quarter relative to everything that you're seeing going on in the company right
now that the exit rate for NII could approach $15 billion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I'd say it's too early for us to tell you that right now. So, one of the reasons that we're comfortable giving you
next quarter's guide is we have a pretty good sense for where loans are, deposits are, what we think the growth
will look like, et cetera. The further we go out, the less we control. So, we tried to give you that spot sensitivity and
we tried to give you the forward sensitivity so you just get a general sense. And then, what we're comfortable
saying right now is it's going to be in that $900 million to $1 billion for Q3, and Q4, it's just a little early to say with
that kind of precision. So, we just wanted to say we think it'll accelerate again in Q3 â€“ sorry, in Q4. So, that's as
precise as we want to be right now, Erika. And it's less about under-promising and over-delivering. It's more about
there's just a lot going on right now in the markets generally, and we'd prefer to be precise â€“ more precise about
it. That's all.

Fair enough. Fair enough.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And I think all we're trying to convey though is we think the fourth quarter is going to be higher than the third
quarter increase...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
...and that's just something â€“ I think we'll give you â€“ we'll be able to give you more sense for that based on the
rate structure and what we see in deposits and loans over the course of this quarter when we meet in three
months' time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Look, Erika, this isn't vainglory to give you specific NII guidance. We're just trying to make sure you guys see the
leverage in the platform for a quarter or two, and you guys can take that and extrapolate based on your own
economic projections. But it's meant just to give you a sense of what we see in terms of loans, deposits and the
pricing dynamics, et cetera. In the near term, we're more sure. Just like last quarter, we said it would be $600-odd
billion, and it turned out to be 800ish because we're careful what we think and what we give you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Got it. And my second question is a follow-up on capital. I guess the first is, are you working to actively reduce the
stress capital buffer? And maybe remind us where you think the pain points were for this year's test that you think
you could address for next year.
And second, should we â€“ what is the pacing of buybacks like from here as you potentially â€“ as you â€“ or not
potentially, as you build towards that January 1st 2024 new higher minimum?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, on the second question, that's going to be dictated by our LOBs, use of the balance sheet. Our number one
goal is to keep them in the market winning every day and let the capital support that. That's what we do because
that â€“ what they're doing is providing good returns and stuff. So, that requires us to â€“ well, will be driven by,
frankly, loan growth and more than anything else in the near term, because the Markets business will bounce
around, but won't move much.
In terms of the stress test, look, the losses and stuff were pretty good. It's the operating expenses, and that's
more continuing to point out the differences between how we run the company, et cetera. And we'll continue as
20

we look at the next year's test, fashion it. There's not a lot we can do on the loan book and stuff. It's the best in the
business, as dictated by their results. So, it's going to be more on convincing on operating expenses and
operational losses and things like that over time.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hey, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi there. Can you guys share with me â€“ if you look at your deposits at the end â€“ or the average deposits in your
fourth quarter of 2019, I think they totaled about $1.4 trillion. Today, you have $2 trillion. And granted Consumer
has grown very nicely, as you pointed out, Brian, I think it's up $358 billion over that time period, can you share
with us your color or your guys' outlook on â€“ as quantitative tightening goes into full speed of $95 billion or so a
month, how do you think that could affect your balance sheet as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we're obviously curious with that trajectory as well. We haven't seen any great shift yet in deposits. This
second quarter was largely just a return to the normal second quarter seasonality we see. We didn't see it the last
two years because there was pandemic cash inflow, fiscal monetary stimulus. And this quarter was probably a
little more elevated. You saw the headlines talking about tax receipts this year were bigger than normal. So, we
felt that. But we haven't seen a great deal of impact from QT just yet, and it feels like our customers still want to
hold a pretty healthy deposit balance. So, I think it's natural to think about â€“ if you go back to Q4 2019, you think
about the fact that the economy is bigger, you think about the fact that the monetary base is bigger. So, there's
probably a floor, but we'll be watching things from here in the same way that you are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Gerard, we can't really go [indiscernible] (01:04:47) against the market here because at the end of the day, that
growth affects the monetary accommodation, the fiscal stimulus, et cetera. But remember, as you're thinking
about that $1.4 trillion, $1.5 trillion and today $1.9 trillion to $2 trillion, you do have to remember that it's three
years, and with inflation and the economy's bigger, it was a 21 trailing economy back then, I think it's 25-ish now,
so you got to kind of not only put your normal growth rate, which you mentioned, but you also got to add to that
sort of the size of the economy and our market share, because our deposits reflect the economy moving in and
21

out of the system and across different money movement from consumers to businesses, businesses to
consumers as paychecks and stuff.
So, I think I'd be careful just saying, oh, let's go back to normalized growth rate off that. You have 2%, 3% â€“ you
have 2% GDP and [ph] 2%, 3% (01:05:44) because you're missing that there's a step-up in size that we picked up
and kept, and we grew market share. So, it'll be higher. We know that. But there will be some impact, some
monetary tightening, or else it wouldn't occur, and it wouldn't be the way the Fed actually controls the economy to
some degree.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very good. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, your loan to deposit ratio, I think, is around 50% today. Is
there an optimal level you think you can get to over the next two years? And then, do you fund that primarily by
drawing down liquidity on the balance sheet? What's your guys' view on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Gerard, we don't manage that number â€“ we manage liquidity resources, leave that aside. But we have a deposit
business that generates deposits from customers, not from pricing, and not from going in the sort of broker
deposits or secondary markets. These are all core deposits coming in from core customers. So, that dictates our
overall size. And then we turn around and make loans to the customers based on the credit standards and
capabilities we have and their demand for credit, and that turns into a trillion dollars of loans. And so, it's not a
number of â€“ Alastair or I or others at the top of the house say, if that number's 62%, it's good, and if 50%, it's bad,
it just â€“ it is a result of running the customer franchise.
The amount of liquidity we have, that is much more planned obviously and planned by the microsecond every
day. And you can see that we're â€“ our ratios and stuff over the course of time, you run far in excess of what we
need and that'll come back down. That's probably going to be more apt to come down as part of the monetary
tightening process and things like that. But that's basically what we're doing now to manage the capital of all this
is taking RWA lower â€“ 20% RWA assets and moving them into 0% RWA to help that and give the businesses
more room to grow the core loan book. But we never manage to the precise number. We let the businesses
operate and then we balance the interest rate risk and the capital questions and the liquidity questions at the top
of the house, but it works pretty well right now.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
...look at the last couple of quarters â€“ if you just look at the last two quarters, you sort of see, as the loans growth
has continued to return, we've â€“ as the securities have matured and prepaid, we've just taken some of that
liquidity and put it against loans, because remember, that would always been our first choice even in the

pandemic. It's just that the loans growth wasn't there. It's back, so we're using those securities and replacing them
with higher yielding loans.

Operator: We'll take our final question today from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups on the balance sheet. So, just following up on the deposit side,
Alastair, in your prepared remarks, you talked about modest growth in loans and deposits from here. So, I'm just
wondering should we be thinking about â€“ when you talk about modest growth in deposits, is that off of your
period-end balance when you think about that after we get past this tax seasonality?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, think about period-end, because that's where we are. We've seen the deposits in the first few weeks of July
have rebuilt, have been stable, and â€“ but yeah, you've got to go off period-end because that's what you got.
There's some fluctuations as you get to month end and all the stuff as you well know, but that's where you start
from [indiscernible] (01:09:18)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

[indiscernible] (01:09:19)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And Q3 and Q4 seasonally tend to be the place where we build deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Okay. And then on the NII side â€“ oh, sorry, on the loan growth side, again, obviously, you're putting up very
strong results [indiscernible] (01:09:32) industry, especially in commercial and in card. Can you just talk about
what you're thinking in terms of how loan growth looks in the second half relative to the last couple of quarters,
and any changes you're just sensing, good or bad, within the customer base and across the various loan
buckets? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, not a tremendous amount of change. We've had good loans growth. We anticipate we'll see good loans
growth. That said, obviously, full year, we're kind of at 12%. We said we thought that we'd have mid to high-single
digits. That's kind of what we're still expecting, is mid to high-single digits. There are a couple of places where â€“
for example, our mortgage pipeline is down just with higher rates. I think it would be natural to think that in some
areas where other areas like securities-based lending, as rates go up, that might damage some loans demand

there. And it feels like business leaders may talk themselves into less confidence, so that may dampen loans
growth. But as of right now, we think it's still in that kind of mid to high-single digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it. And then just one cleanup, last cleanup here. Premium-amo was about a $300 million helper to $0.6 billion.
How much more improvement could you see, and is that built into your expectation for third and fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, it's built in. It'll keep going down, obviously, as rates go up, but it's going to â€“ it's not a linear relationship.
It's more curved. So, it's â€“ and it's â€“ our expectations are all built into our NII guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Understood. All right. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Seeing no more questions, let me just close by thanking you for your time and attention. As you think about Bank
of America for the second quarter of 2022, as we said earlier, the pre-pandemic growth engine has kicked back
in. We're mindful of the debate about a future recession, and we have prepared the company across the last
decade-plus through Responsible Growth to be prepared for that. But as we see our current customer base, we
are not seeing them slow down in terms of their activities. So the story is one of organic growth with operating
leverage, driven by â€“ and using our capital wisely. Thank you.
