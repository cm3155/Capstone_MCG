Joseph R. Ficalora
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier this
morning, we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.23 for the three months ended September 30,
2020. That's up 21% compared to the year ago quarter and up 10% compared to the previous quarter.
We are very happy with our third quarter performance, especially given the uneven economic recovery and the
lingering effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only did our fundamentals and operating results continue to
improve but we also experienced better asset quality metrics as NPA declined along with a significant decrease in
the number of loans on deferral.
Our third quarter results reflect strong top line revenue growth and earnings per share growth on both a year-
over-year basis and on a linked quarter basis. This growth was driven by solid loan growth and continued double
digit net interest margin expansion. This, along with well contained operating expenses, led to higher levels of
pre-provision net revenues.
At the same time, our provisions for credit losses declined compared to the prior quarter. More importantly, the
amount of loans in deferral declined significantly. As previously disclosed, our deferral program is somewhat
unique in that it is for an initial six-month period as opposed to a three-month period. Accordingly, the
overwhelming majority of loans on deferral were eligible to come off their deferral period during October and
November.
From June 30, 2020 to October 22, 95% of the $3.1 billion of loan deferrals eligible to come off of their deferral
period returned to payment status. Both multi-family and CRE deferrals dropped 48% compared to the levels at
June 30, with most of the improvement in the CRE portfolio occurring in the retail and mixed use segments.
As of October 22, our deferrals represented 7.3% of total loans compared to 14.4% as of June 30, 2020. We
attribute the substantial improvement in loan deferrals to our conservative underwriting guidelines and our
proactive borrowers outreach program earlier on during the pandemic. Looking ahead, we have an additional $3.1
billion of deferrals scheduled to come off their deferral period, $2.9 billion of which are scheduled to do so during
November. Given October's strong payment performance, we remain confident about deferral payment trends
going forward.
Moving now to our third quarter results, we experienced another quarter of strong margin expansion. Excluding
the impact from prepayment income, the net interest margin expanded 11 basis points to 2.20% on a sequential
basis and was up 32 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of margin
expansion.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
Since bottoming in the third quarter of last year, our margin has improved 32 basis points. The margin
improvement continues to be driven by a substantial decline in our funding costs. Our overall cost of funds during
the third quarter declined 22 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis.
The decrease in funding costs was primarily driven by the downward repricing of our CDs which resulted in an
average cost of deposits of 85 basis points, down 31 basis points sequentially and 104 basis points year-over-
year. At the same time, loan yields declined only 5 basis points compared to the previous quarter, owing to
continued stability in loan pricing.
Net interest income for the third quarter rose 6% to $282 million compared to the second quarter and was up 19%
compared to the year ago third quarter. During the last easing cycle, our cost of deposits bottomed at 54 basis
points. Given the current rate environment and expectations, we believe that this cycle our deposit costs will
bottom below the level of experience during the last cycle. Given this and further repricing opportunities on the
funding side of our balance sheet, we are well positioned for additional improvement in both net interest income
and our margin.
On the expense front, total non interest expenses were $129 million, up 4% compared to the previous and year
ago quarters. The increase was largely due to our bank-wide systems conversion and COVID-19 readiness as we
reopened our branches and 25% of our employees returned to their offices. Despite the modest uptick in
expenses, the efficiency ratio improved to 43% during the quarter and we continue to benefit from positive
operating leverage.
An important metric to focus on is pre-provision net revenues or PPNR. PPNR for the third quarter was $167
million, up $10 million or 6% sequentially and up $30 million or 22% year-over-year. On the balance sheet front,
total loans were $42.8 billion, up $523 million or 5% annualized compared to the second quarter of the year,
driven by continued growth in the multi-family portfolio and a rebound in specialty finance lending offset by a
decline in CRE. On a year-to-date basis, total loans are up $935 million or 3% annualized.
The multi-family loan portfolio showed continued strong growth during the third quarter, increasing $504 million or
6% annualized compared to the second quarter. Multi-family loan growth has been higher in each quarter over the
course of the year. This growth is the result of the following factors: increased refinancing activity as many loans
are nearing their contractual maturity date or option re-pricing date, higher retention rates, and market share gains
as some bank competitors have either retrenched from this market or have deemphasized multi-family lending.
We were also pleased to see a rebound in the specialty finance portfolio during the quarter. Specialty finance
loans and leases increased $138 million compared to the second quarter of the year. On a year-to-date basis, this
portfolio has grown $438 million. Our originations for the quarter were robust. Total originations excluding PPP
loans were $3 billion. That's down 9% compared to the previous quarter but were up 31% compared to the year
ago quarter. Third quarter originations exceeded last quarter's pipeline by $800 million or 36%.
As for our loan pipeline, we continue to see strong borrower demand for our loans. Our current pipeline heading
into the fourth quarter is $1.8 billion. Included in the current pipeline is 61% of new money. On the funding side,
total deposits of $31.7 billion were relatively unchanged compared to both the previous quarter and to the levels
at year end 2019.
In line with our strategy to reduce our cost of funds, CDs declined $1.1 billion during the third quarter and $3.2
billion during the first nine months of the year. The majority of this decrease was offset by growth in each of our
other lower cost deposit account categories. Our wholesale borrowings consisting primarily of Federal Home Loan

Bank advances increased $675 million compared to the previous quarter as we continue to take advantage of the
low interest rate environment and favorable capital market conditions.
On the asset quality front, our credit metrics improved during the quarter, reflecting the underlying strength of our
loan portfolio. During the third quarter of 2020, our segment of the New York City real estate market, the non-
luxury rent regulated multi-family segment continues to hold up very well. Rent collections in this segment
continue to be strong and have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Also, we have not witnessed any material
changes in residential vacancy rates in our multi-family portfolio, with vacancy rates below 3% as of September of
the current quarter.
The provision for credit losses under CECL was $13 million compared to $18 million in the prior quarter and $21
million in the first quarter of the year. This quarter's provision exceeded net charge-offs by $14 million. During the
current quarter, we had a net recovery of $901,000 compared to net charge-offs of $4 million or 0.01% of average
loans last quarter.
Non-performing assets as of September 30, 2020 were $55 million compared to $63 million in the previous
quarter. This reflects 10 basis points of total assets compared to 12 basis points in the previous quarter.
Excluding non-performing taxi medallion related assets, NPAs would have been $23 million or 4 basis points of
total assets compared to $30 million in the prior quarter or 5 basis points of total assets.
We also announced that the board of directors declared a $0.17 cash dividend per common share. The dividend
will be payable on November 17 to common shareholders of record as of November 7. Based on the yesterday's
closing price, this translates into an annualized dividend yield of 8.2%. Lastly, I'd like to end my formal comments
by once again thanking all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this crisis, and to our employees,
management and board who have shown extraordinary dedication and commitment during this difficult time.
On that note, I would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions. We will do our best to get to all of
you within the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or this week.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: And at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And
our first question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So of the $3 billion that came up, $157 million asked for another additional assistance, is there any reason why
the next $3 billion that's remaining we should not see a similar outcome where 95% go back to paying, so that the
end – year-end deferrals of about 80 basis points or at least less than 1%? And then if you could add to that in
terms of what's your expectation around the outcome of the ones that need the additional deferral into 2021,
what's the loss content around those that you expect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey, Ebrahim. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Go ahead, Tom.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Good morning, Ebrahim. This is Tom. So let me just update you and clarify. So we – as of last night, we
have 97% that has paid. That brings the number down to $90 million, which remains unpaid, and it's still a
probability that we'll collect on this money and there'll be no second round deferral. So, we're very optimistic that
this typically runs in line with our normal payment structure and it looks not unusual after – a month after quarter
end. So we're very pleased with the outcome.
There may be some customers that decide to work with us and some [indiscernible] (00:18:46), but the reality is
that we do have flexibility under the CARES Act to deal with this $90 million that's currently unpaid. And going
forward, just to go back to your additional question, we are very optimistic given that we've spent a lot of time on
knowing what's ahead of us in the next three weeks, so customers' reaction to the various communication that we
sent to them regarding payment status. So, we feel very optimistic that this will continue.
The first slug of money that came due which was that approximately $3 billion in October, the results are much
better than what we all expected. So we're very pleased. I think the reality is that the underwriting standards that
are so strong and the low LTV and the fact that when we're reanalyzing the cash flow when there's a request for
additional relief, it's a very high bar now where the original COVID-19 relief was pretty much open to all customers
if they choose to.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
So as I said in the previous call, as an abundance of caution, we were very liberal on allowing people to have the
CARES Act relief. But going forward, the bar is very high and we do a significant amount of cash flow analysis to
assume that if they're going to get more relief, they have to really need the relief. So the good news is that, as Mr.
Ficalora indicated, the payment structures that are coming in and the collections are very high. The delinquencies
are very low right now for our core business model and we're very pleased with the current results of the first
chunk of large deferrals coming due.
By mid-November, we'll pretty much [ph] work through (00:20:14) through 96% of all deferrals and we anticipate
on updating the marketplace by the end of the – sometime by the end of November on those results. So we
believe it will be consistent. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That is helpful. And I guess just taking a step back, Tom, your stock is down about 25% since July earnings.
There's a lot of nervousness on the New York City economy and real estate market looking out next year.
Obviously, you've been growing your multi-family book. I think you mentioned rental collections are back to pre-
pandemic levels. Just talk to us as we kind of fast forward to the next 6 to 12 months, what are you seeing from
your borrowers as maybe people move out of New York. Like what's the level of concern around credit
[indiscernible] (00:21:01) as you're extending new loans and just how we should think about the losses for NYB?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, again, we feel that the losses will be de minimis. We've obviously adopted CECL this year. So obviously we're
not typically ever had any real significant losses historically for the company, but we've put up sizable provisions
for our historical charge-off history. So clearly, we feel highly confident that the provision will continue to be lower
assuming that the macroeconomic backdrop continues to improve as we're seeing.
So as you can see from the first quarter of the year where our CECL adoption was and going forward each
quarter it's been slightly lower, I can see that trend continuing. And possibly depending on how robust this
collection efforts and then the amount of loans that are no longer on the deferral, we may see some recoveries
sooner than we expect given the magnitude of the other collection efforts. And we really have a tremendous
amount of people back on full payment status and that's not a guarantee for the future, but clearly what we're
seeing in October we believe that trend will continue in November.
And as far as the overall risk we see, I think the risk has shifted a little bit. Initially when we had signed up a lot of
customers on deferral, we write a little bit about mixed use. And if you look where the mixed use is right now at
the $701 million commercial mixed-use portfolio we're down to $57 million on deferral. That's a pretty sizable
reduction and we should hopefully work through that in the next month. And then when you look at what's left on
retail, retail has dropped substantially as well. We have $1.7 billion in retail and right now we have about $189
million left on deferral, which pretty much will work itself out in November.
So those [indiscernible] (00:22:37) shift maybe into office. Obviously, office – there has been a lot of noise in
office in New York City. So we do have approximately $800 million left on deferral with office. Interesting story
with office, we had a large customer that we had an indication that he may have difficulty paying and we
contacted that customer. And at the end of the day, he paid 41% LTV, family asset class. It's something that his
family generated over time and it's a very low LTV. And ultimately, we had buyers with a note. So if in the event
for some reason we had to go that path, we have people lining up at par to take the asset.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
So we're low leverage lenders in particular in a New York City marketplace in Manhattan. And given that there's
been a little bit of shift into office, but retail has performed better than expected as is mixed-use. So, we're very
pleased with the portfolio [indiscernible] (00:23:25) outside of our core product being multi-family. As far as the
multi-family is concerned, it's been very robust on the collection side.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And if I can sneak one more in just on the margin outlook, you've given some disclosures around the debt
and CDs maturities. If you could, one, talk to us in terms of margin outlook for the fourth quarter and maybe
looking out further. And what are the new CDs coming on at and what's the new debt coming on at? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, let me be clear. I'm not going to go into 2021 here. Let's just get through 2020. And we said all along, we
anticipated for the year to have continued double digit margin expansion throughout 2020. We believe in the
fourth quarter was continuously the similar trends. We'll have double digit margin expansion going into the fourth
quarter 2020, which is very encouraging, driven by as we – as Mr. Ficalora indicated, the substantial drop in our
cost of funds, both CDs and bonds.
We have approximately $5.8 billion coming due in three months at $146 million cost of funds, marketplace
between 46 basis points and 70 basis points. That'll probably roll somewhere in between that level. We have
$11.6 billion coming due from 12 months on an outlook on CDs at a $121 million. You bring it down between 50
basis points to 70 basis point depending where interest rates go, which we believe rates will be going lower
depending on the overall economic climate and a lower for longer reality in interest rates. So if that's the case and
the non-traditional banks continue to lower their overall cost of funds, we will enjoy that benefit.
In addition to that, as you indicated, we have about $1 billion of borrowings coming due next year at 2.03% That
money is anywhere from 30 basis points to 70 basis points if we refinance today. And we have another $725
million in the fourth quarter at $118 million. So these are all positive attributes to the continuation of margin
expansion which we will enjoy in the fourth quarter. And obviously going forward, we think that the spreads are
holding up on the asset side. We're still getting north of 3% as far as our overall weighted average yield. And
that's a subject to the market. So we're still getting around that 300-basis point spread over five-year treasuries for
our core product mix on the asset side.

Recognize that in every prior difficult market, we have substantially less losses than the marketplace actually
realizes. And when we look at our existing portfolio, there is a high probability that we continue to be paid on our
portfolios and that the realization of the losses that we've already booked as reserves is highly improbable.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
There is no reason to look to our history and suggest that those losses, which are a CECL accounting losses that
those losses will ever be realized. That's an important thing for us to recognize from the standpoint of future
period performance. We have high probability of performing in the future period in the New York market rather
consistently with how we've performed over every previous cycle. Yes, there are nuances and, yes, there is a
difference with regard to some of the properties that we have, but still the likelihood that we would realize these
massive amounts of charges is highly improbable.

Operator: Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brock.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. I think there was a lot of concern initially going back to the Rent Act and now certainly more
focused with COVID that lower building valuations especially in your core multi-family space would make it much
more difficult for you to pencil out when loans came up for refinancing. Have you found valuations refinancing.
How have you found valuations holding in and can you talk about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Brock, it's Tom. Good morning. I would say that for the most part, cap rates are still remaining significantly
lower than I guess what was expected in the beginning of the year. So rates are still holding in on the
capitalization side. Values are obviously being subject to some regional decline. So obviously when we look at our
peak to trough and we look at CECL moderate downside scenarios, we're running apartment houses down close
to 30%, office down 30%, retail down 30%.
So we're really looking at the impact of the cash flows and what's most important when we're actually receiving
the cash flows from the customers as we work out these ones that are on deferrals, that coming off deferral,
they're able to pay their bills which is telling that they're cash flow positive. And in the event we're going to
refinance them at cash flow positive, we'll be able to – we'll be able to do that with no real issue.
Doesn't mean that everyone is going to be cash flow positive, but the result that we see here to get to that high
bar of standard of additional relief request for the most part, most customers are able to – be able to do their debt
service coverage ratio adequately. It may not be at 1.67, maybe they're at 1.1 or 1.2 but the reality is the money is
coming through. We gave them six months of balance sheet relief and now they have excess cash flow. And they
9

were very thankful for that because obviously it helped them out to work with their own customers on the ground
floor especially on the commercial side.
So I'd say that has been no question, obvious reason an adjustment in the marketplace but given the low LTV that
the company has, we have a 47% LTV in Queens, a 48% original LTV in Manhattan. These are low LTVs. So in
the event that they come back to the bank and which they will because obviously they're relatively short-term
assets, we're very comfortable on refinancing them. And you can see by the origination flow, we've been doing
that.
Our overall retention rate has been spot on all year north of 50%. The goal was to keep it at 50% to shoot for that
5% net loan growth number for the year. This is coming from our own portfolio. We believe that that may improve
as we get into the fourth quarter because obviously, we're seeing a lot of these customers coming to us, in
particular we have about $1 billion that are up for renewal this quarter, which is our own portfolio. And we believe
that all of these loans will have the ability to be able to refinance within the portfolio. So, we're very confident
there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I heard your commentary on loan yields holding in around 3%. It seems to be somewhat at odds with
the drumbeat of lower yields really across the sector in many different loan types. How – is that a factor of the
competitive environment? How – why are you so successful in holding yields north of 3%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:30:24) I'd say on average if you look at where the five-year and the seven-year [indiscernible]
(00:30:27) around 3%, slightly north on average. We are going to do very well in competing. Obviously, the
agency is a major force here, but the structure of an agency loan versus putting a portfolio loan has different
nuances and we're very competitive there.
So if we had to shave a quarter point, an eighth of a point for a solid business, we'll do so. We're not going to do
high LTV. We're not looking – if customers are going to get financing that doesn't make sense to the bank
especially in the midst of a pandemic, we'll let the assets leave the bank. But the retention rate has been hitting
our bogey, which is fabulous. We believe that will improve in the fourth quarter in particular and we feel highly
confident that all in, we can average around 3% loan coupons which when you run that through our model, it
bodes well for margin expansion in a very low interest rate environment.
Where I think there's a disconnect on the funding side is that bank – short-term bank deposits are probably priced
too high in the marketplace. The good news is that we are seeing some of the non-traditional institutions lower
their rates to more inclined to the market rates where overall treasuries are trading plus the spread.

Stephen M. Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Good morning. Just following up on the borrowings here, just wondering what is the ability to restructure any
borrowings either in the fourth quarter and the upcoming year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Steve, I'd say that obviously it's always that opportunity that we look at. It obviously is across the capital for
that. So, we would evaluate that depending on profitability, depending on forward curve analysis. We do have
approximately $1 billion at 2.02% coming due next year so that – so the pain on that to restructure is probably not
significant because it's due in one year.
But we evaluate that from time to time.
In the event that we have, let's say, sizable economic benefits in a given quarter, we will always look to monetize
that opportunity on a core basis going forward to try to enhance future earnings going forward. But clearly, the
stuff in the back end is expensive. We have some expensive borrowings going out to 2028, 2029 with around
[indiscernible] (00:32:48)on that. And I think that will be a much more painful as far as cost of capital and the earn
back. So, we do evaluate earn back. It has to make logical sense to take that charge. And we evaluate that on a
quarterly basis.

Okay. Appreciate that. And, Tom, just thinking about loan growth here. What – on the specialty finance portfolio,
good growth quarter over quarter. Kind of wondering what your expectations are for the upcoming fourth quarter
and into 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say for special finance, we really expected that rebound in Q3 given the decline in Q2 from literally being in the
epicenter of the pandemic. That was a nationwide drop in general. So we had the recovery there. On the auto
side, which is a significant portion of our business, it's booming right now. So there's a shortage of inventory. We
see a lot of god drawdowns right now. So we have a nice uncommitted – committed line of approximately $4.9
billion of outstanding or $3.3 billion.

It wouldn't be surprising to see more lines being drawn down and at the end of the year [ph] so many (00:33:51)
economic recovery continues. So I would say that they will continue to grow. We're very optimistic of that group.
The credit is pristine. We have zero loans on deferral. We don't anticipate – we anticipate zero losses in that
business and it's performing beautifully. So we're very supportive of the business.
Remember this does not come with funding, so we're a credit buy up shop and we choose what we want to
finance. As far as the customer book that we have right now, we have 100% pay and we have a great portfolio
that should just grow from the fact that we have a substantial commitment line. But we also anticipate to be active
in the market to grow it at levels that are consistent, which are very high CAGR.
So I would say it's going to be hopefully continued growth, that with the multi-family CRE right now has been
relatively flat to slightly down as the marketplace given the lack of property transactions and deals happening in
the New York City marketplace. And that could change eventually as the economy recovers on the real estate
side. But multi-family has clearly going to be the drive along with specialty financing in the future for the company.

Stephen M. Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that. If I could sneak one last one in here. I think the press release said $2.8 million in branch
re-openings and COVID expenses. Just kind of curious how you think about expenses on the – for the fourth
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, look, we were probably a little bit off in Q3. We had the conversion, we had some additional expenses there.
The PP&E cost as well as testing for employees and the reopening for both the headquarters, the multiple
operations that we operate as well as the branches, there's a lot of testing involved so there is expenses to get
reopened and that number obviously went into the third quarter.
I would say we'll probably going to be around that $130-million level by year end, so maybe up a couple million
about year end. So for the year, we'll probably stay about $507 million for 2020, which was significantly lower than
our original projection going back to last year at $520 million. We'd like to see it lower, but obviously we never
anticipated the pandemic and there's costs associated with that pandemic. Not material cost, but clearly we saw a
little bit of an uptick in Q3 and we're probably going to see around $130-million level in Q4.

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning, Tom. Tom, you guys mentioned that your loan yields I think were either around 3% or maybe 3%
over the five-year treasury. But your average – more average loan yields on your portfolio currently around $360
million. Is that 60 basis points the right amount of asset yield compression that we should expect over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, Ken, I would just – you got to back up. Prepay, right, so we reported $360 million, but I mean back up
prepay is like $349 million so that's where we are as of the end of the quarter approximately. And then when you
think about what's coming due, it's about a $340-million, to $341 million that's coming due in the fourth quarter on
$1 billion. Next year it's $344 million.
So yes, it's lower than the market yields, but the pain is not as bad as it was a few years ago. So, I think it's
manageable given the deposit costs and the borrowing costs coming down materially from there and given the re-
pricing. Off-cycles were still liability sensitive. So yeah, so I think that – we're getting around the low 3s on
average and I will say a 300-basis point spread. This is certainly depending on the deal, depending on the
duration, 10-year versus 5 or 7, IO versus non-IO. It's all reflected to the market. Competition is fierce with the
agency but we compete and we stand by our solid customers on the asset quality side.
At the same time, I'd also want to make a very important statement. During this whole journey of pandemic
dealing with COVID-19, when we worked with these deferrals we were very focused on making sure to ensure we
have the customers paying their escrow accounts, making sure that we have the operating accounts now in
control. So in the event they come back for potentially a second round deferral, we really understand the behavior
pattern of that building because we have the cash flow. It's no longer housed at JPMorgan, it's housed here. And
that's very important when we entered into these deferral agreements.
So the fact that we have the ability to be a little bit more flexible in rates for the positive relationship, we're
enjoying a nice shift into lower cost funds as well, which has been a cultural change for the bank. Historically,
we've always been about the asset [ph] starting (00:38:22) the deposits flows came from acquisitions, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. No, no. Understood, certainly. And then with the reserves, obviously I know your credit is really, really
good. So there's no question about that. But can you just talk about what the driver of the reserve build was this
quarter? I mean just given the zero NCOs, I would have expected a zero provision.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert A
Cangemi
Senior Executive Vice
President & Chief
Financial Officer, New
York Community Bancorp,
Inc.
No, look, we're in the midst of a pandemic. We have a history of pretty much zero losses especially on the CRE
side. So when you think about CRE, I'd say qualitatively and quantitatively we have a 41 basis points quantitative
13


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
reserve versus a 59 basis points qualitative reserve. And when you add that up, it's – based on our history, it's
considered as a – we would say over [ph] recharge (00:39:05) because we have a history of no losses.
But we acknowledge the property price declines in particular our region, which is the New York City region. So
we'll probably reallocate a little bit more towards the commercial real estate space probably into the office books
and also into the retail book. But I'll tell you this, given the history and the actual results of the loans that have
went back on full payment status, you're probably more likely not going to see reversal if everyone is back on full
payment status because we took into account rating shifts, reevaluation of cash flows and the anticipation at
certain degree these loans would be in a second round deferral. But the fact that we're seeing 97% as of today for
the first bucket in full payment status and that continues, you're probably looking at an adjustment in the future
that will be favorable for the bank because of...
[indiscernible] (00:39:51)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Zerbe Q

And just one quick on expenses. The $130 million you gave for fourth quarter, is there anything unusual in that?
Or is that sort of the new base level that we should grow on as we think about 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll give the Street some guidance when we come out in January but I'm not going to give 2021 guidance yet. I
mean we feel highly confident that the conversion is complete. We have opportunity within the bank. We're going
to look at that very carefully in the fourth quarter. And obviously as you know, historically the company has always
been very efficient. We beat our overall expectations in 2019 and 2020. So we budgeted $520 million, we came in
at $507 million. The anticipated $507 million, assuming we hit $130 million at the end of the quarter, hopefully that
number is conservative.
But our goal is to be very efficient. Given the magnitude of the carnage in the marketplace, we're going to be
always belt tightening. So we'll have some guidance for us – you guys next quarter. But clearly we're very pleased
to be at below $510 million. We like to be at $500 million, but clearly the pandemic had some expenses. And the
post – and pushing with the conversion for a year had some consequences of expense. And I think that we should
get the benefit of that going forward since we're all on one platform and lots of our systems now could be
reevaluated for us to see where our potential expense savings will occur. And that's a process that we'll go
through the year end process and budget and forecast.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. Tom, just your CET1 ratio, it dipped a little bit this quarter. Can you just explain what was
going on with that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I mean – well, mostly growth, right? We were growing. We continue to grow on a quarterly basis. We're very
comfortable with our internal capital model, our capital plans and again this is solely driven from growth. I mean
our earnings are going higher, which is great. The forecast is for the year at 20% EPS growth from 2019 versus
2020, we're on target for that. So, we're very pleased with the growth trajectory of the capital build now. So that's
positive towards overall capital as we are growing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just on your office exposure, do you have the exposure by the different boroughs...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...say, Manhattan?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, look I think Manhattan is the area that we're spending a lot of time on reevaluating these credits and
cash flow and ratings reevaluation. And I'll tell you that if you break it down, I'll go back to the categories, mixed
use we had over $100 million going back to the previous quarter, we're now down to $40 million in mixed use – in
mixed use commercial in Manhattan. The retail is phenomenal. At 99% pay, we're down to $4 million in retail in
Manhattan, which is much better than we anticipated given the pandemic.
Office right now is probably the high bar where we have a total deferral of $800 million. Right now, we're at $762
million that's in Manhattan. We're going to work hard in the next few weeks to see how this all plays out, but that
is the area that has the highest percentage and the dollar amount that's on deferral.
Multi-family as of the end of the quarter – actually end of October 22, which is the update we gave in the investor
deck, is $530 million that's in Manhattan. So that's blended across the five boroughs in multi-family. The next
borough will be Brooklyn at about $460 million for multi-family. But clearly on the office side, that's the area that I
would re-shift the energy level towards the deferral issue that we have to deal with.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just on your office exposure. What was your pre-pandemic coverage ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'd say we anticipate, I have – bear with me one second here. Office, we have about $190 million, just under
$190 million on debt service coverage ratio, LTV at 52%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Perfect...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I used the example that we had in office, very wealthy owners in office as an office building and it was due in
October. LTV was 41%. We had to make sure we get paid on this one. We felt highly confident that this is a – it's
flagship area, flagship location. In any event the building was going to go through difficulties, we have people
willing to work it out with the customer and we sell the note at par. So these are real coveted asset classes. This
is family wealth over many years. Some of them at 1031 Exchanges that has created long-term wealth for
property owners. And then I'm just going to walk away.
So the fact that we gave them six months relief, that's a lot of balance sheet relief, six months cash flow on a large
credit and this is a fairly large credit. And we ended up getting paid, which is great, and that's our approach. Our
approach is at the bar going into the second round deferral if any is very high. We go through a very rigorous
program that the cash flow analysis has to be presented and we feel they have the ability to pay. We're not going
to give out relief when it's not justified.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q

Matthew Breese Q

Hey, just touch on the expenses, the uptick in G&A. How much of that due to the systems conversion and is
therefore permanent versus COVID and subject to fluctuation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say it's probably evenly split from the uptick. I think I guided it was [indiscernible] (00:45:44) couple of million
bucks. I'd say $5 million ahead for the conversion. The rest was PP&E and testing. Remember, we have a lot
more people going back to the various locations and there is an expense that's associated with that dealing with
getting the branches up and running. So all the branches for the most part are up and running for the time being
depending on the pandemic, but clearly with some expense there. So I'd say its split between conversion and
PP&E.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
Got it. And then, could you just update us on the strategy around securities? Where do you want it to be? What
are new yields and what kind of investments are you looking at there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert A
Cangemi
Senior Executive Vice
President & Chief
Financial Officer, New
York Community Bancorp,
Inc.
So in my guide, up double digits for the quarter. I anticipate the security yields to come down, so our guide for the
quarter is up. Again – once again double digits. So assuming 10 basis points up in fourth quarter, which is
reasonable based on our modeling. We are assuming the current yields are coming down on securities. I wouldn't
be surprised we'll see another good significant drop in security. So far, we're looking at somewhere in the $235
million to $238 million type level in the fourth quarter.
And we're being very cautious given the marketplace. So, our securities portfolio as a percentage of assets is
probably – it's been pretty much at the lowest level [indiscernible] (00:47:10) I think it's like 9.58%. Is that right,
John? Yeah, 9.58%, which is about a $5.2-billion book on a $54-billion balance sheet, low. So obviously, we don't
want to jump into the securities market with significant investment now given that we have reasonable loan
demand and we want to be very cautious given where yields are.
So it's a wait and see moment and we can't control interest rates. So we think that yields in general are going to
be relatively low. You're looking at reinvestment yields probably in the low 1s and it's not the opportune time to
grow that portfolio. We may from time-to-time put on additional liquidity. That'll be a business decision that we
decide as how we manage our outgo process, but clearly it's not an opportune time to grow the book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

versus last, and have you seen any risk rating migration?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say special mention went up a little bit because obviously when you go through this analysis and before
you even get as much information you can from the borrowers that are going through the pandemic, we focused
18


New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
(NYCB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
solely on the portfolio that was in deferrals. We've done a lot of work on that. For regulatory reasons, that's what
we should be doing and we shifted a lot of these loans to the special mention.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Again, the good news is that as they continue to pay, they go back to full payment status. And their cash flow in
north of levels that we didn't expect, we're going to roll them at a special mention and that'll be the next phase of
the benefit of that. So we will – we do it as an abundance of caution and conservatism as we should.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then the last one is just you mentioned cap rates are holding up better than one might have expected.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Could you just frame that a little bit better for us, where multi-family, office, retail cap rate is today versus a year
ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'd say consistent. I don't see any movement at all. I mean, we were initially – our view initially was when the rent
regulatory changes came in last year that we had a 30-basis point to 75-basis point adjustment depending on the
borough. And we write a much higher cap rate in the Bronx than we do – in the Bronx versus Manhattan. So
Manhattan cap rates were always lower in general so have a much lower LTV were as an abundance of caution.
But they haven't moved a whole lot. So you're still in the low to mid-4s depending on rent regulatory versus non-
rent regulatory. I'd say for – when you look at some of the deals that were done in the past 12 to 18 months when
since the change in rent laws, I'd say a 5% handle on a 100% rent regulated building is not unusual. But when
you throw in commercial use space and other revenue streams, you start getting into that mid-4s.
So it's been consistent. So we do a deep dive every twice a year on rent regulatory stress testing. And what we
find when we statistically look at the – what's going on in the marketplace, the cap rates were going lower. Well,
we conservatively analyze it with an uptick and – to stress the portfolio, but surprisingly it's been resilient.

Hey, thanks. Tom and Joe, you mentioned earlier about the very strong credit quality on the specialty finance. It
looks like maybe 98% or more is pass rated. So do you have to allocate the reserve at a higher level just given

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 28-Oct-2020
So I would say that historically the company had a loan-to-deposit ratio as high as 165%, so we're not there.
We've had some improvement. It's been a long time since the bank has executed on an M&A transaction. And
obviously our historical growth in deposit has been driven through M&A. So the goal here in the long run is that
eventually as we continue to focus on our business model, which includes know putting businesses together and
getting that funding side shored up on – through consolidation, that's always a possibility.
But absent that, I think you're going to see probably – we'll call it nominal deposit growth and we'll still choose
based on what's best for the shareholders as far as cost of deposits and duration. And right now, the wholesale
markets are very attractive. They're more attractive than what's offered out there and we'll call on the hot money
CD market. Clearly, you can put on five-year money lower than you could on the CD markets. If you go short,
you're looking at between 25 basis points to 38 basis points type cost of funds, depending on your duration risk
that you want to take.
So there is – there's this business decision you have to make when it comes to repricing your deposits
aggressively for growth. And again, our growth is manageable, it's reasonable. When I'm targeting 10% type loan
growth and asset growth, we're still shooting for that 5% net loan growth number driven by multi-family and
specialty especially finance [indiscernible] (00:52:43) by the CRE reduction.
So I think with a reasonable growth in our internal deposit analysis, we can grow between a small portion of that
on deposit growth as well as repricing the funds lower aggressively and benefit from a unique opportunity on the
wholesale side, which is cheaper than retail in this current environment. With the proviso that in the event that
we're fortunate to be able to put something together on the acquisition side or business combination side, that's
where this model can change dramatically to have a different funding mechanism.

Got it. And while I have you, just in the remaining $3-billion deferred book, there is no reason to believe why you
think the experience – because there could be some pushback around there is a higher risk loans in that portfolio.
When we think about the remaining...

Yeah.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

Look, I would say that these are the ones that filed for the deferral later, right? It's one month later.

The other ones that waited 30 days to come back to what the bank offered. So, we were all over these customers.
We understand the dynamic of it. We're very optimistic that this will continue. And I broke out the area of risk. I
think we've shifted it more towards the office versus retail and mixed use, which is a good thing and we'll deal with
that as it goes along.
But these office credits are – the average LTV that we originally [indiscernible] (00:54:03) as 52%, so it's better
than the retail and I'd say not as – obviously, mixed use with the lowest LTV, but it's better than the retail. And the
retail surprisingly did outperform. At $4 million that's sitting in Manhattan right now, we feel pretty good about that.
The retail customers have stepped up in payment status. And the fact that we can re-shift our effort now that
office is the potential risk here, the LTVs of all the customers are very strong. These are large property owners
and we focus on conservative underwriting. And the debt service coverage ratios when generated works ordinarily
high.

Operator: And our next question is from Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

Collyn, good morning.

Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Joe. Tom, I just want to make sure I understand. So on the
expense side and you've given obviously good color. But – so the elevation that you're going to expect in the
fourth quarter and obviously what we saw in this quarter attributable to the conversion cost as well as COVID cost
without specifics. So, generally do – I mean are there – should those expenses be coming down next year or
there are other investments you're going to need to make [indiscernible] (00:55:23)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. I think – yeah, I'd say the investments were made on a conversion. We spent a lot of time, effort, and energy
over years to get this conversion done. It was the largest conversion the bank ever went through [indiscernible]
(00:55:32). It was a partnership. We collaborated together. We worked together as what the bank needs were and
we adjusted the top offering and we worked with them over the past multiple years. So we feel most of that
expense has been absorbed.
Going forward, we're going to have – I'm not going to give 2021 guidance yet, but again we're an efficient
company. We want to get that efficiency ratio down to 42%. That was the goal for 2020. We think we'll hit by the
end of the year and we're also driving profitability up. So if you look at where our EPS CAGR was 2019 versus
2020, we should be up around 20% EPS growth with significant margin expansion. I think when I first gave my

margin guide, people felt that I was way too aggressive at being a 2.25% margin. I said we came off of a low –
was it 1.88%, John? 1.88% in margin. So we felt between 30 somewhat basis point is reasonable.
So, here we are coming into the fourth quarter. I gave the guide for 10 bps going into Q4. It gets you to that 2.30%
number and hopefully I'm conservative. And I think it all depends on what happens next year with cost of funds
going forward and where the shape of the curve is. So the good news is that the spreads are healthy, that we
have healthy spreads in our business model. Is it [ph] 275 bps or 300 bps? It's not 110 bps (00:56:46) like it was
going into the financial crisis.
And I think the competition has waned a little bit. I see people a little bit nervous to do lending in New York and
we're open for business in New York. We're going to be there for our customers in these uncertain times and
these are cash flowing assets and the collections are high, and we're very comfortable on working with these
historical good property owners that have been doing business with us in good times and bad times.
