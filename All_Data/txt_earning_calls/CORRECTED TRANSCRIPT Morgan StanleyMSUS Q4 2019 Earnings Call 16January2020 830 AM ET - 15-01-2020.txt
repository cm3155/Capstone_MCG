Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to
our earnings release, financial supplement and strategic update. Copies of which are available at
morganstanley.com.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-
GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. This presentation may not be
duplicated or reproduced without our consent.
Within the strategic update, our reported results for 2014 have been adjusted to exclude several significant
intermittent items, which were highlighted in our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K. Likewise, our reported EPS
and ROTCE metrics for 2019 have been adjusted to exclude the impact of intermittent net discrete tax benefits.
These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of 2014 and 2019 operating
performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP adjusted operating
performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
James Patrick Gorman
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2019 was a strong year, representing one
of the best in our history. Results were within our target ranges with contributions from each of our business lines.
Jon will discuss the details of 2019 in a moment, but first, let me take you through our annual strategic update
presentation.
Please turn to slide 3. I think about our firm's transformation in five-year increments. Over the first five-year
period, we worked aggressively to clean up the issues from the financial crisis, stabilized the firm, integrated
Smith Barney into our franchise and reset our strategy. Over the next five years, we've made significant
investments in our business around digitalization, technology, talent and the balance sheet. We grew revenues by
20% while we managed expenses tightly, doubled net income, and materially increased capital return. Our
ROTCE now stands at nearly 13% and EPS has more than doubled, excluding intermittent discrete tax benefits.
Today, we will discuss the next phase of our evolution. The goal continues to be to shift our business further,
emphasizing more durable sources of revenue within Institutional Securities and from Wealth and Investment
Management. The continuation of this evolution should by design help support a base level of profitability during
periods of market disruption.
Drilling a little deeper into this, throughout this decade-long journey, we defended and expanded our Institutional
Securities' footprint which we show on slide 4. Our brand is closely tied to our institutional presence and leading
integrated investment bank. Our premier institutional franchise remains a key competitive advantage, which has
allowed us to take share and grow revenues despite a shrinking wallet.
At the same time, the contribution from Wealth and Investment Management continues to grow as shown on slide
5. Over the last five years, we've increased the profitability of our Wealth Management business while still making
investments in the US banks and our Modern Wealth platform. Of particular note, or nearly 100% of business
days, we have revenues greater than or equal to $60 million, nearly 3 times that which it was five years ago.
We also invested in our Investment Management platform. We put together a new growth-oriented leadership
team and focused on clients, solutions and new products. We highlight the growth in long-term net flows which
reflects strong long-term performance. With combined revenues of approximately $21 billion, our Wealth and
Investment Management businesses are among the largest platforms in the world and now we have an untapped
opportunity to further scale our Wealth Management channel through our workplace offering.
Meeting these ambitions for future growth would not be possible without a strong culture and a cohesive team. On
slide 6, we describe our culture and the tenure of our leadership team. We have an eight-year track record of
stating and meeting various public goals. We continue to invest meaningfully in our culture and diversity efforts to
ensure we remain an employer of choice for our top talent. And further, Morgan Stanley has been at the forefront
of sustainable finance. We founded our global sustainable finance group over a decade ago with the mission to
accelerate the adoption of sustainable investing across capital markets.
I want to spend most of my time providing a bit more detail about the future opportunities we're excited about and
that we see across our franchise. Across our segments, we have platforms with scaled benefits, and we're
positioned for growth. Let's start with Institutional Securities on slide 7. Our institutional footprint and franchise is
extremely strong. In the face of a declining wallet, we've gained share over the last five years across our
institutional businesses, and we have reason to believe these gains are sustainable. Our business has benefited
3

from the stability of the leadership and commitment to a global client footprint. We expect to continue to hold and
gain share across the division.
On slide 8, we take a deeper look at Wealth Management. 2020 marks a new chapter in our Wealth Management
strategy. The significant investments we are making in the digital space, the acquisition of Solium position us to
efficiently service the mass affluent population and capture new clients and assets through the workplace.
Moreover, we can leverage the corporate relationships we've built through our institutional offering as we look to
add new corporate clients. We've completed the Morgan Stanley at Work offering to span beyond just Shareworks
by Morgan Stanley our stock plan administration platform. We're enhancing and investing in our financial wellness
and retirement offerings. This more fulsome suite of products allows us to deliver services to an even larger base
of employees, and this will help ensure that our touch points are not limited to stock plan participants.
As illustrated on this slide, we're continuing to win new mandates. The combination of the state-of-the-art
Shareworks platform and the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management capabilities is being very well received in the
marketplace. We expect to fully convert all of our existing corporate clients to the Morgan Stanley work model by
the end of 2021. To-date, nearly 40% of those plans on the legacy Morgan Stanley system have been transitioned
to Shareworks and the remainder will be accomplished by year-end 2020. And by the end of 2021, individual
employees of our corporate clients will gain access to financial coaching, exclusive educational content and our
self-directed brokerage offering, providing them with an introduction to our Wealth Management services.
Over the next five to seven years, we expect to convert over 1 million employee participants to either Wealth
Management digital or advisory channels, adding to the more than 3 million client relationships we have today.
We'll be able to provide a compelling offering for all our relationships, servicing the ultra-high and high net worth
segments with financial advisors and more mass affluent clients with our Virtual Advisor or digital solutions.
Moving to slide 9. We've been clear that we believe that supporting advisors with cutting-edge technology and
enabling them to deliver unique product and set of services to clients will be our competitive advantage going
forward. The investments we made with our digital initiatives have been embraced by our advisors, and
anecdotally, these tools are supporting asset consolidation. Additionally, of course, we've seen over $250 billion
of asset flows in advisory over the last four years and continue to believe that at least half of our client assets will
migrate to advisory over the medium-term.
Let's talk about Investment Management on slide 10. The asset management sector is both very large and
extremely fragmented, lending itself to opportunities for growth in areas where we believe we can deliver
differentiated value to our clients. And to me, one of the most exciting things we've done to capture this
opportunity is product innovation, illustrated by the number of new products we have developed. These products
have broadened our revenue base, made us more relevant across the client spectrum, and translated into
material revenue and asset growth. Since 2016, we've launched many new products successfully, leveraging our
global client franchise. We've already seen significant contribution from these products, generating $90 billion of
incremental assets under management and almost $500 million of incremental revenue in 2019 versus 2016.
These strategies continued new product launches and investments in our client franchise more broadly will be a
very important component of future growth.
Another key driver of growth is our existing diverse alternatives client franchise. You see on slide 11, our
alternatives client platform is at scale and there is strong secular growth in private alternatives. In addition to new
private alternative product launches noted on the prior page, we're seeing strong organic growth in our existing
high performing private funds. For example, our infrastructure number three fund, which closed in the fourth

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
quarter, is over 50% larger than infrastructure two, raising $5.5 billion of institutional capital versus $3.6 billion
respectively.
Further, we continue to see very strong organic growth in our premier institutional core real estate strategy. Our
alpha products across both private and public markets as well as our world-class global solutions capabilities will
be critical contributors to Investment Management's revenue growth. In our public active equity strategies, our
strong performance in global client footprint has driven robust net flows. We believe we rank number one in
organic growth since 2017 among the top publicly traded active equity managers.
Let's turn to slide 12. We expect that these and all our other growth initiatives along with expense discipline will
drive further ROTCE expansion. In 2015, we communicated that we believe we were capital sufficient. And since
that time, we've continued to deploy our capital to meet our strategic objectives. We look forward to the transition
to the new capital regime and expect Morgan Stanley will be able to return excess capital to shareholders while
continuing to invest for future growth. Our robust capital position will enable us to pursue opportunities to invest in
the franchise and return capital. We're confident in our ability to deliver two-year ROTCE expansion of 13% to
15%.
I'll conclude with our updated strategic objectives. The targets we expect to achieve in 2021 as well as our longer-
term aspirational targets are shown on slide 13. We have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business
into what it is today. As we execute on the next phase of the firm's journey, the objectives listed here, assuming a
normal market environment, should result as a natural consequence. We believe that in 2021, Wealth
Management will be 28% to 30% pre-tax margin business and will exceed 30% over time. This business has
compelling scaled benefits. Between our core competency of serving ultra-high and high net worth individuals and
our near expansion into the workplace, there is clearly room to grow from here.
Beyond Wealth Management, we're making numerous investments across all of our platforms to enhance the
digitalization of our firm and overall technological capabilities, given our scale and other efficiencies. We have
largely been able to self-fund these investments. Between this and revenue growth, we expect to achieve an
efficiency ratio of 70% to 72% in 2021 and below 70% in the long-term. As a result of these and all the other
efforts, we expect our return on tangible common equity to rise from 13% to 15% in 2021. And over the long-term,
we aspire to have a return on tangible common equity of 15% to 17%. Given our established track record, our
competitive positioning and our continued investment into our business, we are confident in our ability to achieve
each of these objectives.
I will now turn the call over to Jon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together, we
will take all of your questions. Thank you.

Jonathan Pruzan
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced a record level of revenues in 2019. We had strong momentum
through the quarter and finished the year on solid ground. In the fourth quarter, firm revenues were $10.9 billion,
increasing 8% sequentially, contributing to full year revenues of $41.4 billion. Fourth quarter PBT was $2.7 billion
and EPS was $1.30, resulting in an ROE of 11.3% and ROTCE of 13%. In the fourth quarter, severance
expenses of $172 million related to a December employee action and intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $158
million largely offset each other. For the full year, ROE was 11.7% and ROTCE was 13.4%.
Total non-interest expenses were $30.1 billion for the year. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to
2018 at $11.3 billion, demonstrating our ability to self-fund incremental costs related to absorbing and integrating
5

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Solium and increased technology investments through continued discipline over our more controllable expenses,
particularly marketing and business development and professional services.
We continue to actively review efficiency opportunities, including optimization of our global workforce through
reduced dependence on contingent workers and leveraging our global in-house centers. We also see
opportunities for vendor consolidation across the firm over time. This focus will result in continued momentum to
control our non-compensation expenses and help us achieve the objective that James just discussed.
Compensation expenses increased 7% on a full year basis. This rise included severance charges and significant
movements in deferred compensation plans as well as increased revenues. Our full year expense efficiency ratio
was 72.7%, below our 73% target.
Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $5.1 billion, marking the best
fourth quarter in over ten years. Results were driven by strength in Investment Banking especially advisory.
Additionally, we did not see the seasonal slowdown in sales and trading or underwriting typical of a fourth quarter.
For the full year, ISG revenues were $20.4 billion, slightly below last year's record level. The compensation ratio
for the quarter rose to $40.7%, reflecting $124 million of severance related to the December action and the impact
of movements in investments associated with an employee deferred compensation plan. After considering the
impact of these items, the fourth quarter compensation ratio was approximately 36%, and looking at the full year,
again, after considering these adjustments, the compensation ratio was under 35%. DCP created some volatility
in this ratio, but as we have said many times in the past, it has a very limited impact to the bottom line.
Investment Banking had the strongest fourth quarter in a decade, generating revenues of $1.6 billion. The
sequential increase was driven by strength in advisory and seasonally robust results for underwriting. Overall,
pipelines are healthy across products. The pace of M&A remains strong, and we would expect the period of
activity to extend. The global equity pipeline remains robust as many issuers target capital raises in the first half of
2020, particularly across healthcare, consumer and technology. As we said before, the conversion from pipeline
to realized remains dependent on market condition.
In Equity sales and trading, we retained our leadership position and are number one globally for the sixth
consecutive year. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, down 4% sequentially. Strength in the Americas was
offset by declines in EMEA and Asia. In cash, we continued to expand our share across regions, which partially
offset the impact of global market volumes. Prime brokerage performed well as client activity rose during the
quarter with equity markets trending higher, and derivative revenues declined sequentially as lower volatility
weighed on results.
Fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of $1.3 billion, down 11% from a robust third quarter. We
continue to deepen our relationships with our client base. Results were driven by strong performance across the
credit complex. Micro produced another solid quarter with well diversified performance. Healthy levels of client
engagement supported results. We continue to invest in our secured lending businesses which performed well
and witnessed increased client interest from commercial real estate products. Balance sheet velocity remains a
focus in this business, and on a full-year basis, improved from the prior year.
Macro results declined versus the third quarter due to lower client activity. Commodities revenues also declined
sequentially. However, client activity and further geographical diversification of the revenue mix supported results.
On a full year basis, fixed income was up 11%. Strong performance in micro outweighed the decline in macro
where a difficult environment weighed on results in FX and rates.

Turning to Wealth Management. We reported fourth quarter revenues of $4.6 billion and pre-tax profit of $1.2
billion, resulting in a PBT margin for the quarter of 25.4%. Strong revenues were offset by higher seasonal
expenses as well as a $37 million severance charge which had an 80 basis point impact on the margin. On a full
year basis, the PBT margin was 27.2%, representing 100 basis point expansion over last year. The business
continues to illustrate the benefits of scale. While investing in this business and absorbing the Solium expenses,
non-compensation expenses declined 3% from 2018.
Transactional revenues were $829 million, up 39% sequentially. Results were principally driven by gains in
investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans as well as improved retail engagement.
Asset management revenues were essentially flat versus the prior quarter. On a full year basis, asset
management revenues were also flat as a large market decline in Q4 2018 impacted first quarter results. Total
client assets of $2.7 trillion increased 5% sequentially and 17% versus the prior year, reflective of broader market
movement.
Over the last several years, we have seen net new assets of approximately 4% of beginning period client assets.
While these flows are an indicator of the health of the business, we continue to believe fee-based flows are a
more relevant driver of near-term results. We had $25 billion of fee-based flows in the fourth quarter, a record.
The shift towards advisory continued and fee-based assets now represent 47% of total client assets, up from 45%
last year.
Loan growth continues to be strong across products. Lending balances increased to $80 billion or 11% versus the
prior year. We continue to see strong receptivity in our lending offering. Our investments into technology have
better enabled our advisors to identify clients who would benefit from our lending product suite. This has been
especially effective in securities-based lending. We expect to continue so see strong receptivity, resulting in loan
growth of mid-single digits in 2020. Total deposits rose 5% sequentially.
Within our bank deposit program, we have seen stable deposit level since May with a seasonal uptick in the fourth
quarter. We continue to invest in new banking products and our high yield savings product has also continued to
gain traction. Our new money savings campaign has raised close to $14 billion since its March launch. Net
interest income was in line with last quarter. On a full-year basis, NII was up slightly including the impact of
prepayment amortization. Over the next year, we would expect the full impact of 2019's three rate cuts, the
realization of the forward curve and the continued diversification of our deposits to offset the benefit of our lending
growth.
As James discussed, we will continue to invest in our workplace offering and also build out our US banks to drive
further growth. That being said, we would expect the margin to rebound nicely in Q1 from its fourth quarter
seasonal low. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year,
revenues were $3.8 billion, representing a $1 billion increase from the prior period. Total AUM rose 9% to $552
billion, of which, long-term AUM was $356 billion. We continue to generate strong positive net flows across major
high conviction active strategies. Long-term net flows were $6.7 billion, the strongest in eight years. And we had
another strong capital raising year capped off with the close of our $5.5 billion Infrastructure III fund.
Asset management fees of $736 million grew 11% versus the third quarter. Recall, a significant amount of
performance fees are recognized in the fourth quarter. Performance fees for the quarter were driven by strong
results in our core real estate strategy and management fees increased on higher average AUM. On a full-year
basis, asset management fees increased 7% to $2.6 billion. Investment revenues were up $565 million in the
quarter and $1 billion for the year. This line is primarily driven by carried interest, which is earned from clients who
are invested in our private funds. The increase this quarter and year was primarily due to an underlying
7

investment, IPO subject to sales restrictions within an Asia private equity fund. This event generated a significant
amount of accrued interest revenue, the ultimate realization of which will depend on the monetization of the
underlying position in the fund. As we have previously said, this line is lumpy.
Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy equity method investment and a third party asset
manager. Total expenses increased 52% sequentially. In particular, higher compensation costs are reflective of
higher accrued carried interest compensation, which was primarily related to the event I just discussed. Non-
compensation expenses were driven by higher BC&E expenses related to the launching of new products and
reflecting our continued investment into this business. This business continues to grow, and we expect it will be
an increasingly meaningful contributor to total firm earnings. We continue to look for organic and inorganic
opportunities to grow this business and to effectively meet the needs of our clients.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 31 million shares or $1.5 billion of common stock and
our board declared a $0.35 dividend per share. After considering $158 million and $348 million of intermittent net
discrete tax benefits, our tax rates were 21.4% and 21.3% for the fourth quarter and full year respectively. We
expect our 2020 tax rate to be slightly higher or approximately 22% to 23%, and will exhibit some quarter-to-
quarter volatility. Taken in full, we are pleased with the firm's results this year. We enter 2020 with asset levels at
new highs, healthy pipelines, constructive markets, engaged clients and a right-sized expense base.
With that, we will now open up the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your line is now open.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Hi, thanks very much. Just curious within your two-year objectives, particularly on the ROTCE, what capital return
assumptions are incorporated into that? Is that steady state now or any changes from what we've seen the last
couple years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Well, again, just from a technical standpoint, since we haven't seen the new proposals, which we think are
forthcoming, it's sort of hard to say what the future return profile looks like other than it will be consistent with what
we've done prior until we have more information.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Fair enough. On the gain in Investment Management I guess IPO out of a private equity fund, I'm assuming
there's a standard lockup and illiquidity discount. Can you tell us what that company is so we can track it so we
don't have surprise ups and downs every quarter?

Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
I'll give you some more information on that, but first, I'd clarify there is no illiquidity discount there. The company is
public, and it's marked to the stock price on a daily basis. And you mentioned it is in the Asia – one of our Asia
P/E funds. It was an investment we made more than six years ago or the fund made more than six years ago into
a China consumer products company. The company has been quite successful and grown quite nicely, and it
went public in the fourth quarter on the Hong Kong Exchange, and the IPO has performed quite nicely.
To give you some sort of context around the round numbers, the investment that we made was less than $50
million and the current investment value is approximately $2 billion. So we have not only the carried interest, we
also have a small LPE investment in the fund, and so the ownership and carry is going to be fluctuating until we
have the underlying investment monetized. So, as of today, we're comfortably above the preferred return
threshold in that fund, but as I said before, it's an unrealized gain, so it will have more volatility if there is volatility
in the stock price. So just to sum up, given the size and given that it's public, we would expect a little bit more
volatility in that investment line in IM, and we would also expect corresponding volatility in the IM compensation
line as the investment team has about half of the carry typically.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning. Maybe a question on Wealth Management. I believe you recently made some changes to the
comp grid that should be beneficial to Wealth Management margins certainly next year. I think the question is
longer-term, can you keep pulling the comp lever? And I guess as I look at the industry and what's happened over
the last decade, whether it's wirehouse consolidation, the demise of the broker protocol, more client stickiness
because of lending and technology, it feels like you can do that, but I'd be curious to get your thoughts on using
the grid to drive margins over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, listen, I'll take that. We're not using the grid to drive margins. We use the grid to drive behavior to help us do
a better job with our clients. So most of the changes with the grid over the last decade have been designed to do
exactly that. They have supported asset-based accounts, have supported working with more sophisticated
complex clients. They've supported larger producers who have been growing their business. So I don't think of the
grid as an expense item. I think of the grid as frankly what really reflects what we're trying to do with the business.
And the best advisors embrace that, and take great stability among the top advisors as a result of that.
So, Christian, the changes this year were modest, but within the changes, sort of under the covers, there are
more significant changes as you move [indiscernible] (00:32:00) effectively from one set of behaviors to another.
And ultimately, the goal is to continue to professionalize the financial advisor workforce, which is a fantastic group
of people, and been transformed in the last decade from producing something like $300,000 revenue to over $1
million revenue per person. And the grid has got to be aligned with their interest as well, and that's something
Andy and the team are very focused on.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Okay. Thanks. Maybe just to get back to the question I think Glenn asked earlier on because the ROTCE target
does stand out, the 15% to 17%. It does catch one's eye. Can you just maybe just help clarify like what level of
capital you assume? Do you assume like the absolute dollar of capital level will go down over time, and that's how
you get to 15% to 17%? Just – it'd be great to get that sort of like clarification.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, I'm probably going to disappoint you, Christian, and not give you exactly what you're going to need for your
model to produce that answer. We run the business based upon a myriad of things that we see from global
economic growth to market share we have in each of our businesses, to the capital we're using to prosecute our
earnings in those businesses, our ability to drive efficiencies across the group net of investments that we're
making, and we're currently running an ROTCE around 13%, and so the two-year objectives feel like there's no
compelling reason why we'd go below that. In any individual quarter, of course, these things bounce around as
you've seen in our numbers over many, many years.
But over that time period, we think the 13% to 15% is a very reasonable expectation, and assuming normal
market condition, we will deliver on that. The longer-term aspirations are really speaking to where we see
embedded scale we have in our various businesses, what the longer-term growth projection looks like, our ability
to manage our expenses. You'll see our non-comp year-over-year essentially flat this year, which – and modestly
it's pretty impressive given that we're investing in a lot of parts of the business. So if you just roll the math forward
and make reasonable capital assumptions, you get to those ROTCE numbers of 15% to 17%. There is, as
always, through the CCAR and the capital process, a kind of wild card. How much do you ask for, what's the stock
trading at when you're doing your buybacks, do we increase the dividend, are we going to make other acquisitions
or investments along the way. There are a lot of things that drive the longer-term.
But what we're trying to set when we set longer-term is what do we believe the potential for this business is.
Many, many years ago when our Wealth Management margins were around 10% or 11%, we set a target of 15%,
and I said publicly I thought they could get 20%. And obviously, we exceeded that, and the whole transformation
of the business helped on that. Many years ago, we set an ROE target of 10% when I think our ROE was around
2% or 4% and we were constantly asked on this call when are you going to get there like the kids in the back seat
in the car saying when are we going to get there, when are we going to get there. And we kind of got there. And
our feeling now is there's no compelling reason with normal economic growth and good discipline around expense
management and the embedded scale in our businesses and the strength of the culture why these returns
shouldn't be achievable over a longer-term period.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Question on the pre-tax margin target here in Wealth over the next
two years, good to see you guys expecting a nice step up. Could you talk a little about the market and revenue
assumptions embedded within that target? And at this point, you guys seem to have implied generally especially
with your comments just a minute ago, James, about non-comp flattening out here in 2019 that we should be
expecting self-funding of an investment and more stability in the non-comp as opposed to the growth of prior
years, is that fair?

Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
There is a couple of questions in there. I think when we think about our budgets, we generally use sort of
consensus views on markets and rates, and that's what we've done here. The 28% to 30% margin target as you
said is a nice improvement and continues to trend. It also gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in this
business, which we will continue to do around our Shareworks platform and the Morgan Stanley at Work. We've
done a lot of work around the digitalization which James talked about, which is critically important to the customer
experience and the client experience. And we'll continue to make investments there. And so I don't think there's
any outsized expectations around markets or rates, just what we see in the consensus view going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A

Yeah, I think, Brennan, I think that we've finished the year at 27.2%. Obviously, fourth quarter and somebody will
probably ask us about it so I'll address it right up, was 25% and change. There is some seasonality. We had some
severance expenses in there, DCP and other stuff. As I said before, these things will bounce around quarter-to-
quarter. I can't guarantee where the first quarter is going to be, the second quarter, third quarter, but over a full
year, we're at 27.2% with normal economic growth. What we've done with the business, I think that 28%, I'd be
disappointed if we're not at that. I'd just put that out there. Can it be higher than that, that's why we put a range on
it. Do we think it's going to be over 30% the next two years, no we do not. And I think we've got to be responsible
when we set these targets about what we think is a likely outcome, not a three standard deviation outcome. What
is the likely outcome? And coming off a 27.2% margin, 26.2% I think the year before, approximately – it's kind of
grinding high. Why is it grinding high? Well, as you bring incremental revenues in, the incremental margin on the
incremental dollar revenue is higher than the embedded margin so we're growing higher.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. Clearly, Solium should also – the Solium acquisition and integration should
also help too. Appreciate that. I think you made reference, James, in those comments to what the underlying
margin might have been in the fourth quarter. I know I think Jon, you said 80 basis points from severance and
wealth, so that gets you to 27%. There was some DCP, but I don't think you talked about what impact that would
have had on the Wealth Management margin. If you can please let us know that. And just a request, maybe I
know it doesn't impact the bottom line, but the DCP creates some noise around some of the underlying metrics
which makes it – it can blur investor visibility into the underlying trends. It'd be really helpful if you could disclose
that or consider disclosing that going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, so just I appreciate the comment, and we continue to give further thought to that. But we do give a
reasonable amount of disclosure in the K around that. We try to highlight it to you when it's a meaningful
contributor based on meaningful swings in the marketplace across all the businesses. As I said before, the PBT
impact is not material. Generally speaking, $1.00 of revenue versus $1.00 of comp expense. Your fourth quarter
comment though, we generated 25.4%. I think you said with the 80 basis points, we'd be at 27%. Obviously, we'd
be at 26.2%. And then by definition, when you look at all of these ratios, they are negatively impacted by that
dynamic, effectively one for one. It's not precise, but that's what we, to simplify, have been using, and again
appreciate the comment, and we'll give it some thought. But we obviously feel very comfortable with the new
targets that we laid out at 28% to 30% on that margin.

And Brennan, you make a good point. It creates noise. I mean, I remember the old days when we used to have to
deal with [ph] TBA (00:40:36) on these calls which would move – I think one year it moved $6 billion. And that sort
of bizarre impact it had on our financials. Fortunately, we managed to clean that up. The DCP, I mean the funny
thing is it's kind of a good news story, right. You actually want it to be messing with the numbers like this in a
positive way because it means the stock has done well, which people invested in, and the markets are doing well.
This was a year where [indiscernible] (00:41:01) was up 25% and the stock was up 28%, 29%, so pretty unusual
year. And that's why I think we're seeing the outsized on this year. I wouldn't – I mean, listen, if that happens in
2020, I'll be delighted, and I don't mind the noise if we get that outcome. But I'll leave it to the accounting and
controlling team to figure out what the right disclosures are. But that's where we are.

Good morning.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So appreciated some of the additional disclosure on the Wealth Management conversion targets from
Shareworks. Certainly, that's an area where there's significant interest post the Solium deal. I recognize it's a five-
to seven-year goal, so you certainly have a lot of time to execute on that conversion target. I was just hoping that
you can maybe help us frame how we can think about either the incremental revenue or even just AUM growth
opportunity over that horizon, if you ultimately execute on that goal, and just separately do expect the pace of
onboarding to be somewhat linear or is it going to be backend loaded?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Let me try to answer that. I mean, a couple of things. One, first of all, we had – Solium was only in our results for
eight months this year. I think we mentioned before that it was dilutive to PBT, so obviously dilutive to margin.
We'll have the full effect of the acquisition this year, which will also be dilutive to margin and to PBT, and then we
would expect it to turn potentially PBT neutral or positive and then to build over time and improve the margin. The
conversions, there are several stages as James mentioned. There's just – making sure that we get all of the
corporate clients on to the Shareworks platform. That's accelerating. That should be done this year. And then
integrating it into the Morgan Stanley at Work – Morgan Stanley at Work platform will take another year. I think
we'll see sort of an acceleration, a slow build, if you will, of converting our Morgan Stanley at Work clients into
either the digital or advisory channel. But we think a million incremental customers on our current base would be
quite attractive and a real nice growth engine. Obviously, the potential for the different dynamics around the size
of that client, i.e. whether it's mass affluent versus ultra-high net worth or high net worth will have an impact to
asset levels and cash levels and net new assets, but again incrementally, if we think we can bring on another
12

million customers in five to seven years on top of our current existing base, it's why we're so excited about the
opportunity.

some of the return targets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, again, so I think that we'll obviously have to see where the pools come out this year when everyone
finishes reporting and we get the data. It looks like the pools are pretty stable. I think from a budgeting, not I think,
from a budgeting standpoint, we generally think about those types of pools growing with sort of GDP, so sort of
very limited or sort of a couple percentage point type growth in the pool. And then we couple that with our view on
investment dollars and share points. So that's generally the macro backdrop that we use for the budgeting, which
we'll obviously track the consensus views on GDP and US growth and so on and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I'd just add. I mean we don't talk ironically as much about the Institutional Securities business, which has sort of
been our core and our lineage since our founding 85 years ago. But in each of the – we have a slide in there that
shows in each of the five businesses debt underwriting, equity underwriting, advisory, M&A, equities and fixed
income, they were able to gain share over that five-year period. And this year, they delivered their fourth
consecutive $5 billion revenue quarter and we've never had a year where we've had $4 billion, $5 billion quarters.
I mean what this business has been characterized by at least one and sometimes two pretty volatile and difficult
quarters each year.

Now, we can't, and it's obviously more vulnerable to market swings, but I think what the team has done in
balancing out the business, Ted and the group have made it a much more stable organization I think within fixed
income, the way that's been turned around with stability that Sam and his team – I see it gives us more comfort
that we've got a lot more stability embedded in the business from prime brokerage financing through to the M&A
which remains very stable. Obviously, you're going to have volatility, but we think these shares are sustainable.
Some places we could grow share. But it's really a function of stability is what I'm very focused on for this
business. Because the capital on the balance sheet, shall we say is stable, it stays there. So we need the
revenues to be stable, and that's what they delivered.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I'm wondering if your minimum targets are high enough. Slide 7 through 11 highlight what you expect, Institutional
Securities, the five-year share gains continue, Wealth Management you increased clients there by one-third albeit
over a longer timeframe, Investment Management you have new products, you have digital initiatives, non-comps
flat, it's all going well, and you reported 13% ROTCE last year, and you're looking for a minimum ROTCE of 13%.
So why not raise that minimum floor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Mike, we now go back a long way, and I'd have to say you're a model of consistency. I think I'm not sure we've
ever had a call when you haven't asked for higher targets, and it's hard to feel defensive when we're talking about
Wealth Management margins above 28%, efficiencies at 70-plus-percent and ROTCEs at 13% to 15%. Listen,
our job is to be as transparent and realistic as we can. These targets have one significant caveat, which is the
markets. If the world collapses, they will be very difficult to meet, and we will not be the only financial institution
struggling with meeting whatever public targets they have out there. We don't run this place on the basis the world
is about to collapse, and we have no evidence that 2020 is going to be a difficult economic year. Difficult
politically, potentially geopolitically, but certainly the economic outlook remains very, very stable. So when we do
the math and put the targets together, we do it based upon a balance between what is our downside in a normal
scenario, and what is a realistic upside over the near-term.
Longer-term, that's great. That's sort of – it's fun and it's interesting and it's sort of saying what could we deliver
aspirationally, and that's probably where your head is in the longer-term part of that chart, the right-hand side. But
in terms of running the business and in terms of thinking through our capital deployment, our dividend strategy,
our compensation, all of our investments that we're making, we really focus frankly on the two-year objectives.
And what I've always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should
be able to deliver in all normal circumstances. The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty. So listen, I
would love for us to deliver on your more aspirational views each year, but we can't reliably project that, so I don't
14

think we should reliably project it. And if you folks want to model in different numbers, that's obviously your
decisions. But we've got to do what we think is right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just a follow-up, slide 7 and 8, one is the expectation to continue to gain share, I guess the share gains in the
European banks, your expectations for that to continue. And then on the Wealth Management side, going to the
mass affluent, you're going down-market to the teeth of the Schwab zero-commission for wealth. And after a
number of years of kind of moving back from the lower end clients. So just if you could address those two specific
areas. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, well, I think the word we used was sustainable share. We certainly don't see our share going backwards in
these businesses, and there is clearly in different parts of the institutional business, we think we can gain share in
certain regions in the world where we're looking forward to getting our full China license there and continue to
grow out our Asia presence for example. So I feel good about these share numbers. You point out there are
different parts of the industry that are going through larger transitions now, those kinds of things we were doing
several years ago. So there is potential share upside. No question about that. We can't model that because that
would be pretty aggressive.
But you can certainly – we certainly affirm that the share we have now is stable. Normal market environment
growth, that obviously translates into higher revenues and we think there's some upside on share. On the going
down-market, I think about it differently. And for sure, commission pricing has been going to zero in small trades
for a long time. And there have been examples of that in the digital space for years. I think the move that Schwab
made just accelerated what was something that had been happening for a long time, and their business models
are not built around their secondary commission revenues that you and I understand. I don't think about this so
much as going down-market. I think about it as opening up a new segment to Morgan Stanley.
There are basically three ways in which people have their wealth managed. One is through some sort of advice,
whether it's full service, private bank, trust bank, independent financial planner, financial advisors and so on. And
we're very dominant in that space. The second is direct digital, and there are a whole set of new platforms, but
there are some very established at-scale players in that space. And the third is the workplace. And the workplace
remains – there are certain players who've been very dominant in it, but we think this is also a very interesting
space. Solium gave us a leg into it. We see a lot of financial wellness, financial advice, financial planning that can
be brought to employees. If they're into a default digital account when their stock plans [indiscernible] (00:52:30)
for example, that's relatively easy for us to drive on a digital and direct platform. So I see it. Let's sort of
characterize it as going down-market and more characterizing as just expanding the universe of clients. There are
a lot of people out there working companies, making good money through these share plans. They do not want or
need one of our large financial advisor teams. That's for sure. But that doesn't mean they can't have access to
what Morgan Stanley can deliver.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
Good morning. I realize you don't want to give all the details on the expense adjustments related to deferred
comp, but I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of full year efficiency ratio of 73% as I think about kind of
getting the 70%, 72%. It would be helpful if you could give us kind of the clean base for this year either now or I
guess was probably coming in the K. But it would be helpful just to get that base. And I guess my question is if
you don't want to do that, really just as we think about the efficiency improvement, can you just elaborate a bit on
the drivers? Obviously, it's a little bit of revenue growth as you talked about, a little bit of growth in wallet and
some of the efforts in wealth, but just maybe elaborate on is there opportunity to bring the comp rate down? And
on the non-comp, is it about keeping it flat or maybe some opportunities to cut on an absolute basis? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
So I think I've given in the comments and we've given the comments and we hear you on the DCP. So I'm just
going to focus. You can see from our targets that we've lowered the efficiency ratio. We had a little bit of
severance in there, and again, the DCP adjustment would be – would also impact that ratio slightly. But I think
when we think about expenses and expense discipline, we're talking about expense discipline across all
categories of expenses, both comp and non-comp. We allocate resources at the firm level, which is why we have
a firm efficiency ratio target. Some of these ratios get a lot of attention to them when they are – if you think about
the comp ratio, with an ISG, that's only 40% or less than 40% of our comp versus the totality of the firm. We
constantly have been focused on being disciplined on comp and non-comp. What we will say is that we have
been disciplined on comp. If you – the only thing that we continue to try to do and we have done quite
successfully is to pay our people competitively across all of our businesses as we try to attract and retain talent.
But we're disciplined across all those categories. When we get to the non-comps, we've been very focused on
professional services.
As we've grown our businesses, and we've grown some of the digital and technology and digitalization of the firm
as well as complying with the regulatory agenda, we relied on sort of contingent workers and consultants to help
us build that, this practice. And as all of that has matured and turned more into BAU, we've been able to rely more
efficiently on employees which is why you've seen the head count grow even after the December action. And so
we've been able to take out some expenses there and optimize the workforce. I mentioned vendor consolidation.
We've done data consolidation in the past. So we're constantly looking for opportunities in the non-comp space to
continue to self-fund and drive efficiencies and those types of categories are the ones that I would say that we'll
continue to focus on in the future. And we have finally seen some productivity gains around the significant
investments that we've made in technology and digital, and that's led to some of the actions we've taken as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I would just say something about the comp ratio. And I think it's important to say it. Years ago, when we started on
this journey, the ISG comp ratio was 62% I think if memory serves me and Wealth Management I forget what is,
but it was well in the 60s. And we had a long-term aspiration, again, I think Wealth Management down to 55%,
57%, and ultimately ISG to 40%. The last time we publicly set a comp ratio goal for ISG I think was in 2015, which
was 37%. And we've managed in the last three or four years to be under that, sometimes 34%. This past year
was a little higher, and we had some stuff going on as we've all talked about.
But we also have started moving – we've had a lot of contractors and contingents around the world working for us,
tens of thousands actually. And we've decided as part of our restructuring offshoring, we've moved some of those
folks in as permanent employees, more stability with that. For a lot of reasons, I don't need to go into it on this
call. That then becomes part of the comp pool. So I don't want to be tied to a comp ratio when we're really
managing the firm for overall expenses. That's what we're going to manage for. And there's a reason you're not
16


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2020
seeing new comp ratios in these numbers, but you're seeing a pretty aggressive efficiency ratio. We want the
ability to manage the firm for shareholders on best basis, and that's to have the best people working most
efficiently. So you will not see – you're never going to see comp ratios in the 40% in ISG again. That's just – we're
not going to do that. But we just want to maintain flexibility to run the business and not do goofy stuff like not
make contingents employees because we're worried it will affect the comp ratio, when in fact, it brings down the
non-comp ratio. So that's – we're going to run the business on that basis, and we've been doing that for a couple
of years, but I just wanted to be explicit about it.

Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. Just a quick one for me. Just in Investment Management, you guys have done well from product
development and kind of growing that business. It does seem like on the private side, it's more of your assets. We
can see it in the performance fees in the carried interest. I don't know if you can quantify maybe how much of the
AUM now you had the potential to generate carrier performance fees. Just something that's obviously hard to
model, but you also probably don't get much credit for it just because we don't have kind of the magnitude of that.
So any more clarity around that would be useful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
I would – again, the different categories that we break out, obviously the alternatives generally are where we're
going to have carried interest or performance fees. We tried to give you some more information on that in this
deck, and again, it's hard to model because as we said there's some lumpiness to it. But we've had some really
good performance across all of the strategies within IM. We've also seen stable fee rates across the platform. So
as AUM has grown, we've seen that fee-based revenue number grow. Again, a year-over-year comparison, that
was up 7%, which was quite healthy in this industry given what you're seeing across the complex. So, again,
we've tried to give you the information to do it. But even with perfect information, these things are very difficult to
project and model out.

James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I don't think – I don't know that we can really talk about products and acquisitions. I mean, most of the product
gaps we have, we try and fill organically. Acquisitions we tend to do for broader strategic reasons, either build
scale in the business, open up a new vertical, expand geographically, rarely would we do a significant acquisition
or even a small acquisition on a pure product. It's more platform or business unit. So I think the short answer is
no.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Understood. And just last question. We appreciate your targets for the next couple of years, recognizing
that you guys have changed considerably since the last time we've had a sustained bear market, can you share
with us the tools that you had used to mitigate revenue shortfalls that are likely in a bear market to try to help
reach these goals should a bear market occur the next two or three years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Expenses. Yeah, I mean, basically, that's your tool, right. Good news is with a bear market, your stock is low,
you're buying back more shares, your EPS is growing because your share count is down. Our share count
peaked at about $2 billion and we're around $1.6 billion now, so we bought back I think nearly 100 million net
shares last year when the stock was trading around $38 a couple months ago. So that was a little gift that God
gave us. So I think it's just very – it's very hard to fight the market if you're in a sustainable bear market, you got to
restructure your organization to reflect that. You've become smaller, more nimble and more efficient. And we and
all our competitors would have to go through that. You can't plan the business based upon a bear market
obviously. You've got to plan the business based upon a normal market, not a bull market. And that's where we
set our goals from.
But as I've been very clear, and I'll finish on this note, these goals are always subject to a normal market
environment. If we have an abnormal market environment one way or the other, then the numbers will be what
they'll be. But they probably won't be what's on this page.
