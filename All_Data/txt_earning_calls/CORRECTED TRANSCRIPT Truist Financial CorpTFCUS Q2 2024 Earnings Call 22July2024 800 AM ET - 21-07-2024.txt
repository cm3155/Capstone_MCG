Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our
second quarter results, let's begin with purpose on slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company
dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Purpose is the foundation for things that we do.
We believe purpose and performance are inextricably linked. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought our
purpose to life last quarter. During the quarter, Truist Securities advised and served as an active joint book runner
for Oglethorpe Power's inaugural $350 million green bond, which will be used to support their investment in Plant
Vogtle, the largest producer of clean energy in the United States. The company is committed to reducing GHG
emissions while delivering cost-effective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio. This transaction
represents only the second green-labeled bond in the US where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear
energy.
We also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high school and college students
called Truist Life, Money and Choices. This initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial
lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures. These are just a couple of examples of how we
brought our purpose to life during the quarter. I'm very proud of the meaningful work we're doing across our
businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities and, of course,
our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose. So let's turn to our key takeaways on slide 6. On an adjusted
basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share, which
excludes the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale
investment securities, a charitable donation to the Truist Foundation, and a few smaller items that Mike will
discuss in further detail in the call.
In addition, pre-tax restructuring charges of $96 million, which were primarily related to the sale of TIH and
severance, and also negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share. So, looking through a few discrete
items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance
was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 3% on a linked quarter basis which was
driven by 4.5% growth in net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during
the quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost. As a result
of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by 2.6% linked quarter and decreased by 3% on a year-over-year
basis. We are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in 2024 versus last year.
We're also pleased that non-performing loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and that
net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our remaining
stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and creates
substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In recognition of the incredibly long-term positive
impact of our insurance business, we utilized a portion of the gain to make a $150 million charitable contribution
to the Truist Foundation to further our purpose-driven work across our banking footprint for years to come.
Simultaneously, with the closing of TIH, we repositioned a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio
which, along with the proceeds received from the sale of TIH, is expected to provide an offset to TIH's earnings
contribution. Mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call.
In late June, our board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through the end of
2026. We plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter and will initially target share repurchases
of approximately $500 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Finally, we continue to actively pursue
growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses. Although overall loan demand
remained slow during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share

within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, which I'm going to discuss a little later in
the call. So, before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail, let me provide
a quick update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients on slide 7.
We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 7% and
that digital transactions increased 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. Transactions continue to shift
towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions which are up 39% year-
over-year. In addition, we added over 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new-to-
bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a 17% increase over the second quarter 2023.
Importantly, digital checking account production among Gen Z and millennial clients is higher by 42% on a year-
over-year basis. A new, more modernized small business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in a
new high in application completion rates, while we're also seeing increased digital engagement with our small
business clients.
We've also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge
and care through 1.8 million caring conversations, resulting in 1.4 million accepted recommendations for great
Truist products and services. These enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in
higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency
using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm really proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital
engagement.
So with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in more detail. Mike?

Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to
spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results. First,
on May 6, we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings at an
implied value of $15.5 billion. At closing, we received after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $10.1 billion and
recorded an after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. The sale of TIH created $9.5 billion of capital, which generated 230
basis points of CET1 under current capital rules and 254 basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in
Basel III rules. Our tangible book value per share also increased by 33%. On the same day, we executed a
strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. We sold
approximately $27.7 billion of market value, lower-yielding investment securities, which resulted in an after-tax
loss of $5.1 billion.
The investment securities that we sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of
2.80% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that
time. Including the tax benefit, the sale of investment securities generated $29.3 billion of proceeds available for
reinvestment. When coupled with the proceeds from the sale of TIH, there were $39.4 billion of proceeds
available for reinvestment. Of that, we invested approximately $18.7 billion in investment securities yielding
5.27%, with the remaining $20.7 billion held in cash. At the time we invested the proceeds, the blended
reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was 5.22% for the remainder of
2024, including the impact of hedges. As Bill mentioned, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of TIH
and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace TIH's earnings
contributions.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
These actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing
standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and, importantly, create capacity for Truist to grow its core
banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases. Now
turning to our second quarter key performance highlights on slide 9. We reported second quarter 2024 GAAP net
income available to common shareholders of $826 million or $0.62 per share. This included a net loss of $4 billion
from continuing operations or $2.98 per share and net income from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or
$3.60 per share. The net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $4 billion or $2.98
per share was impacted by the following items. A $6.7 billion pre-tax or $3.80 per share after tax loss on the sale
of certain available for sale investment securities.
$150 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation. A $13 million pre-tax or
$0.01 per share after tax expense related to FDIC special assessment adjustment. Net income available to
common shareholders from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share was impacted by the
following items. A $6.9 billion pre-tax or $3.60 per share after tax gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. A
$10 million pre-tax or $0.01 per share after tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of TIH equity-based
compensation. So, on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2
billion, or $0.91 per share. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pre-tax restructuring charges totaling
$96 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.05 per share.
Approximately $33 million of these pre-tax charges, or $0.02 per share after tax, negatively impacted net income
from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization. The remaining
restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses
associated with closing the divestiture of TIH. Total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available for sale
investment securities increased 3% linked quarter, due to a 4.5% increase in net interest income and relatively
stable non-interest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter, but were down approximately 3%
on a like quarter basis. Our CET1 ratio increased by 150 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily reflecting
the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning I discussed earlier. In addition, net charge-offs declined 6
basis points on a linked quarter basis, and our non-performing loans remained relatively stable both on a like and
linked quarter basis.
Moving to slide 10, average loans decreased 0.7% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker client demand
collecting. Average commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion, or 0.7%, primarily due to a 0.8% decline in C&I
balances, driven at least in part by capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased $1
billion, or 0.9%, due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and a decline in indirect auto. Other consumer
balances, which include our specialty lending units, experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal
strength at Sheffield and increased demand at Service Finance. Overall, we expect client loan demand to remain
relatively muted in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on slide 11. Average deposits decreased 0.3%
sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in non-interest bearing time and
broker balances.
Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased 1.2% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is
unchanged compared to 28% during the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we experienced an increase in
deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Specifically, total deposit costs increased six basis
points sequentially, 2.09%, which resulted in a 1% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 39%. Interest
bearing deposit costs increased seven basis points sequentially to 2.89%, which also resulted in a 1% increase to
our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta cost of 54%. Moving to net interest income and net interest
margin on slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income increased 4.5% linked quarter, or $155
million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
Excluding the impact of this repositioning, our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked
quarter basis, due primarily to our focus on average client deposits, which declined less than we expected.
Reported net interest margin increased 14 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.03%. This was due primarily
to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning. The partial quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning
helped drive a 31-basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to 2.77%.
We estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest rate perspective,
comparable to Q1. Turning to non-interest income on slide 13. Adjusted non-interest income, which excludes the
losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning, decreased $8 million, or 0.6%, relative to the first quarter.
The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which
declined $37 million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower M&A fees, equity originations, and
trading income partially offset by higher loan syndication fees. This decline was partially offset by higher mortgage
banking and other income. Adjusted non-interest income increased 4.2% on a like quarter basis, as higher
investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on
deposit and other income. On a year-to-date basis, investment banking and trading income is up nearly 30% over
the same period in 2023. Now, I'll cover non-interest expense on slide 14. GAAP expenses of $3.1 billion
increased $141 million linked quarter primarily due to higher other expense related to $150 million charitable
donation, higher personnel costs reflecting merit increases, and higher professional fees.
These increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in FDIC expense due to a larger
special assessment recorded in the first quarter. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization,
adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.6% sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional
fees. On a like quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined to $86 million or 3%, reflecting lower head count in our
continued expense discipline. Moving to asset quality on slide 15. Asset quality remained stable on both a like
and linked quarter basis reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving
problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 6 basis points to 58 basis points. The
decrease in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal
declines and certain de-risking initiatives put in place in the second half of 2022.
Our loan loss provision declined to $49 million linked quarter, reflecting our stable credit performance, but it still
exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter, resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance. Our ALLL
ratio increased to 1.57%, up one basis point sequentially, and 14 basis points year-over-year, which reflects
ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Despite the normalization, non-performing loans
remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies increased just 2 basis points
on a linked quarter basis. Wholesale criticized loans declined a $1 billion linked quarter to $10.8 billion. Included
in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.6% of total loans.
However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 9.3% to 9.7% during the quarter to reflect continued
stress in the sector. Approximately 6.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as non-performing, compared
with 5.5% at March 31.
Approximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably,
approximately 22% of our office portfolio is housed within our community banking and wealth segments, where
loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent, and overall loss is lower. We expect
stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well-reserved, but
our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio. Pointing out of capital on
slide 16, Truist's CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% at March 31 to 11.6% at June 30. The increase was driven by

the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and organic capital generation, which was partially offset by the
loss on the sale of certain available for sale investment securities during the quarter, which I addressed earlier.
Importantly, the sale of TIH creates capacity for Truist to pursue growth opportunities in our consumer and
wholesale banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders as evidenced by our share
buyback program. Truist is well-positioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios, which was evident in
our most recent CCAR stress test results released in late June. Specifically, Truist had the second lowest C&I
loan loss rate and the third lowest CET1 erosion rate versus our peers. Our stress capital buffer will improve by
10 basis points to 2.8% effective October 1st. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 430 basis points, higher than our
new regulatory minimum of 7.3%, leaving us well positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to
shareholders. Our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and
liquidity in the industry, as our estimated CET1 capital ratio under proposed Basel III endgame rules improved 20
basis points to 9.1% at June 30 which is 180 basis points above our new regulatory minimum.
And now, I'll review updated guidance on slide 17. Looking into the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to
increase 1% to 2% from second quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5 billion. We expect net interest income to
increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning
completed on May 6th. We expect non-interest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.
Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by 3% in the third quarter due to
higher professional fees, software costs, and higher marketing costs. For the full year 2024, we previously
expected revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5%. We now expect total revenues to decline by approximately 0.5% to
1% in 2024. Our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance, partially offset by
lower client loan demand, and our updated view of interest rates, which now assumes just one reduction in the
federal funds rate in November of this year.
Consistent with our previous expense outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain
approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect
net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. As Bill previously mentioned, we are targeting approximately
$500 million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase
authorization announced in late June. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a
taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final
remarks.

William Henry Rogers
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great, thanks, Mike. So our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged. They include growing and deepening
relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, returning capital to our shareholders via share
buybacks and our common strong dividend, and enhancing our digital experience through T3 all while maintaining
and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We made demonstrable progress on these
priorities during the quarter, and I'm really proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid
underlying earnings, improved momentum, and sound asset quality. All this was accomplished while also
completing the divestiture of Truist Insurance Holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter.
These actions created significant capital capacity to grow our consumer and wholesale businesses and return
capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend and our recently announced repurchase authorization of
up to $5 billion of our common stock.
In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet is well-positioned to weather an even wider range of economic
and interest rate environments. Although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
expected to replace TIH's earnings in the near-term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in
near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. As I've said previously, our starting point
for our ROATCE is exactly that, it's a starting point. We're going to move with pace to deploy our capital, improve
our returns, but we're not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet short-term expectations that do not
have long-term positive impact on our company, clients, and shareholders. We have a clear understanding of not
only where we want to win but where we want to win profitably. We'll look to share more of our plan with you as
we progress through the remainder of this year.
I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is
centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at
Truist. We have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base, grow our core banking
business, and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer,
payments, investment banking, and wealth platform given the ongoing investment through our existing footprint
and specialty areas. In wholesale, we've invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last
several years. We've also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products. These investments
have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number
of lead roles across several product lines.
Most recently, we've invested heavily in our payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is
an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time, not only with new clients but also within our
existing client base. We have a clear focus, high expectations, and a compelling teammate value proposition.
Many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge and we have very successfully hired additional strong
talent in wholesale, primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purpose-driven
high-performance culture. We plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building
out our middle market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities
within our regional business. We will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment
banking coverage and expertise.
We're making these investments while also adhering to our expense discipline, which is helping fund investments
in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management. In consumer, I'm really
encouraged with our momentum. Our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by
increased net-new checking account production, increased primacy, and lower attrition rates. Net-new checking
account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added 38,000 new consumer and
business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates and
increased primacy and usage within new account openings. As I previously mentioned, we added 180,000 new
accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which
represented a 17% increase.
In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital
account openings, with balances up 60% over the second quarter of last year. In consumer and small business
lending, we've been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint. In the second quarter,
small business applications increased 15% linked quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in our pipeline, giving us
confidence that average consumer balance [ph] since (00:28:41) excluding run-off and residential mortgages will
stabilize in the third quarter. In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as a company at the
midpoint of this year, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the
future. We have tremendous momentum within our company, we have momentum with our clients, and we've got
great momentum with our teammates.

We have an incredible franchise; energized, purposeful teammates; and specialized capabilities that our clients
value. We think the ability to grow our core banking business, our profitability, and return significant amounts of
capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique
differentiating factor for Truist. I am optimistic about our future. I look forward to operating our company from our
increased position of financial strength. And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of our incredible teammates

Thank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session?

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe to start off with NII, it feels close to restructuring. We've bottomed now and you should get a step-up next
quarter. But can you maybe just talk about the drivers of sequential NII growth over the next few quarters? Do you
expect margin improvement? And then, how do you think about where the margin could be heading over the
medium term? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ryan. We've mentioned in our comments that we do expect the NII to improve next quarter by 2%
to 3%. Really, the bulk of that is driven by just the full quarter impact of the repositioning that we completed back
in May. We continue to expect there to be some pressure on client deposit balances as well as loan balances, so
maybe a touch conservative there. We did have some nice, just to say it, just some nice outperformance in the
second quarter on client deposit balances, which really helped stabilize that core NII ex the bonds, but that's really
sort of the story for Q2. And I think Q4, just looking out a little further, as you think about kind of rest a year
trajectory, kind of more of the same, right? I mean, we mentioned we've got a November cut in. We think that

helps a touch, but that is the first cut and it's pretty late, so we've got pretty modest expectations around the
impact there.
And I think for us, really, what will stimulate some improvement on the NII side will just be some of the core
balances, so getting client loan demand increased which hopefully will generate balances as well. And I'll just
mention this. I mean, we're very focused around the company. Pick your segment or LOB, everybody in the
company is very focused on realizing that growth opportunity once it presents itself. And you've heard this from, I
think, others this week and last week. There just has really not been a lot of client activity.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe this one for Mike or Bill as a follow-up to Mike's comments. So, it looks like loan balances are
getting closer to level off. But Mike, you highlighted 3Q, you're expecting it to be muted, and my interpretation was
that it doesn't sound like you're expecting a lot of growth in the fourth quarter. So maybe just flush those
expectations a little further, Bill, when do you expect it to turn positive? What do you think the drivers are? And I
guess, given the strength of your footprint, do you actually expect Truist to begin to outperform peers on growth at
some point? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I'll start with the second part of that first, and the answer to that is yes. But it has to have growth. We've got to sort
of see that coming. Clients are on the sidelines. I mean, we can feel that in our conversations. Our conversations
are increasingly a lot more strategic, so I feel like we actually even know more about what our clients are thinking.
But they're a bit on the sidelines. Our production was up, so we saw production being up. It was really probably
best in consumer, where it was up a little more significantly. Utilization is just absolutely flat. But paydowns were
also up. And our clients that aren't towards the larger side, they were accessing the capital markets. And the good
news is, I mean, you see that in our investment banking, particularly in our DCM results. Our capture rate on that
is really, really high, so we sort of see the other part of that.
Despite the pipelines being up, production being up, I just want to be careful, Ryan, about sort of like putting a
stake in the ground and saying, okay, it's going to return on X. I mean, take this weekend. I mean, there's a lot of
uncertainty out there in the world and in the market so while clients have capacity, we're coil spring, ready to go,
positioned better than anybody, I think we just want to be realistic about when and if that well not if but when that's
going to come back and when it's come back and come back with some strength and when it does, I think to your
latter part of your question we're in the best markets and I think we should disproportionately grow faster.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. I guess as a follow-up to that line of thought, Bill you mentioned that you'd be methodical and kind of not
getting ahead of yourself to just use near terms. I'm just wondering if you can kind of just remind us again, now
that we've got the buyback out there, now that restructuring is done, just gave me more color on the loan growth.
Talk about prioritization, what would lead you to do kind of one more than the other in terms of moving the ball of
all things excess capital related and then how that kind of leads into your pacing choices on the buyback
specifically. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ken, great question and obviously something that's important that we're going to be calibrating, priority one,
two, and three is growing our business. I mean, we think we've got a great franchise, a great market. We're really
well positioned. We've invested in talent. We've invested in capabilities. So, I think we've got the capacity and the
capability to grow in our core business. So, that is absolutely going to be the primary focus. We raised capital in
the most efficient way possible. You just couldn't have raised it more efficiently than how we raised capital. And
we want to make sure that we deploy that also in the most efficient way possible, long-term benefit for our
shareholders. So, I think we've put together a compelling return perspective with what Mike outlined. We're going
to do about $500 million a quarter for the next couple of quarters. I would presume we'd enter next year in sort of
the same kind of pace. But remember, that's also on top of, we've got a really strong dividend.
So, in terms of total dollars returned to shareholders over the next six months, I mean, we have a really
compelling value proposition. So, we're going to calibrate that as we go along. We don't want to over-index on
one and lose this incredible capital advantage we have for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then secondly, as you enjoy this incremental NII benefit, it does seem like in the second half, certainly
in the third quarter, expenses look to be increasing. Can you give us also a little bit of context in terms of how
you're calibrating the new better revenue outlook to making those investments and the pacing, just flattish? Flat is
a tough, like, overall guide to see through, but kind of at flat it implies that third quarter and fourth quarter
expenses are still – are going higher. Just wondering if you could provide a little context underneath that about
your pacing of your investment spending and to the areas you mentioned earlier? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Ken. It's Mike. Maybe take a swing at that one. No, you're right. I mean, look, we think we do see growth in
the third quarter on the expense side. I think that's still on a like basis, close to flat, maybe even a touch better.
And I think that implies, if you think about flat, maybe a touch of growth in the fourth as well. Look, I mean, the first
half of the year we were very focused on cost discipline and, frankly, following through on our commitment around
flat. That's still important to us. But as we've sort of gotten to the midway mark, there have been certain projects,
whether it be some marketing spend, sort of you name it, [ph] nits and nats (00:38:45) that perhaps were delayed,
and that drove some of the beat maybe even this quarter and even in last quarter. And so some of that stuff just
makes a ton of sense.
And as we really shift our mindset – and you heard Bill talk a little bit about it in his prepared remarks around
some of the hiring we're doing in middle market lending as an example around our payments business, some

calibrating of marketing spend, etc. These are all factors that are driving our outlook for the second half and so
what we feel and we said that is really since last fall, we are very, very confident committed to being sort of 0.0 or
better on expenses this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And Ken, just add to that, I mean when we undertook this approach in the fall of last year, but we were always
really clear that's going to include investments and the timing of those sort of as Mike pointed out come quarter-
to-quarter and we're seeing the benefit of that. I mean investments were made in payments, investment made in
talents, so the expense guidance was always coincident with that. I'll just say it, because I think it's really
important, the discipline that we have in the company around both of those is significantly increased. So, we sort
of know the next dollar invest with a lot of confidence. And we also have just incredibly strong discipline around
the expense side and where the opportunities are. So, I think we've got the right balance here and as Mike said
wholly committed to a flatter, better expense proposition for the remainder of this year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning everyone, thanks for taking the question. Mike, I know you suggested you all are relatively neutral to rate
moves and I think still kind of for better or worse a lot of investors consider Truist among the, kind of closer to the
liability-sensitive side of the equation. In that vein, you anticipate just one rate cut in the remainder of the year.
How would another one or two affect that NII guidance? Obviously, timing would be a factor, but just curious on
your overall thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yes, good morning, Scott. Yes, so we do have the one cut in November. If we got one earlier call, I think the
curve today has a September cut and maybe December and maybe even a touch more than that. That would be
a help for us. Look, we – our baseline path does show benefit from down rates. I think the question that I brought
it up in sort of my earlier question that Ryan asked, that first cut, given, how high we are and how late we expect
it, we're just trying to be reasonable in thinking about the benefit we'll get there. But I think you're right. I think if we
got one earlier, and then may be perhaps a second, that would be a good guy. I will say this, I think just given
where we are in terms of how high we are and how long we've been here and some of the client behavior that
we're able to observe, I think the more impactful catalyst will be, again, getting some of that loan demand and
balance growth and client deposit growth as well. So, we'd take it all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears just a second, something you might be able to
address the investment banking line, down a little in the quarter, but I'd say you're, at least as I see it, you're still
well above a recent run rate, so it's still a very strong number. Maybe if you could touch to or speak to sort of

overall thoughts on the outlook, and then maybe a thought on what you might consider sort of a sustainable base
of revenues for you all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, we're – the investment banking business is always going to be a little quarter-to-quarter variation.
In the first quarter, we had one of the highest M&A fees in our company's history, so that sort of change impacted
that a bit. But most importantly, I feel really good about the momentum. So, if you look at sort of our relevance, I
mean, we're gaining share in virtually every category. The things that we're doing in terms of active bookrunner
and left-lead transactions, and DCM, half of our fees were being from active bookrunner, dramatic change from
where we've been in the past, lots of left-leads transactions in there, and again, increased market share. And
most importantly, just really good relevance. So back to sort of the comment about talent and comment about
adding talent and upgrading our toolkits, our commercial bankers' focus and understanding and, of our
capabilities is just increasing exponentially.
So, our dialogue, as I mentioned, with our clients is really strong. It's all strategic dialogue versus product
dialogue, which is really good. And I think for the balance of the year, I mean, I think this is the kind of momentum
we ought to be able to continue in investment banking, so I think we feel good about that.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just putting everything that you've said together, Mike, maybe I'll address this one to you. Your net interest
income was better than consensus, both mostly on the net interest margin. You mentioned that the impact of the
margin from balance sheet restructuring is a partial one. If I look at the line items on non-interest income, you also
beat consensus there for the quarter in terms of the core items. And consensus is at down one, which is at the
low end of your revenue range. I guess, like, what are we missing? And I heard your response to Ryan's question
about you expect balances to continue to come down on both loan on deposit side. But if your starting point on
net interest margin is higher than consensus and then you have a little bit more pull through, a month's pull
through in the third quarter and you're neutral to rates and September will help, I guess, are you being very
conservative on what you could accomplish in the second half of the year?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
Because I get the conservatism from a business standpoint, but from a rate standpoint it feels like you guys are in
good shape to maybe do a little bit better?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Erika, I appreciate the question. I mean, I think there was a beat on balances in the second quarter,
especially if you look at it on an average basis, and so our rate paid was a touch better than we thought, and so
you're right, starting position better than where we would have expected to be in April. I think the pressures that
we expected in the second quarter, we still believe will persist in the third, especially in terms of balances and rate
paid. Another piece of this is that while we did get some benefit on our net interest margin from the bonds, like re-
couponing, some of the benefit as well is just on a smaller balance sheet. So, we did, for example, we paid down
some wholesale liabilities late in the second that will come through in the third on an average basis. So, you'll see
more net interest margin improvement, but it'll be on a more efficient, smaller balance sheet. On rates, I don't
want to call the ball on conservative, non-conservative.
I think we're cautious on what benefit we'll get on the first cut or two. We've thought about it a lot, done a lot of
work and analysis. You look at sort of historically over the last, call it 30 years, the down cycles and the betas
have been slow, right. So, I think that's in our thinking too for the rest of the year. And look, I've said this a couple
of times, I think for us, the thing – we're like – feel fine about the guidance we gave. I think what would really be
upside for us would be a little bit of pull through on more client activity and the ability to generate more loan
volume, and with that will come deposits. You get that, and maybe you get Scott's extra cut in early, and that feels
good. I mean the hurts are obviously the cut we've got, no cuts perhaps, maybe that's not such a bad guy, and
then just the pressure that we've been seeing on balances, both deposits and loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I got it. And my second question is for Bill on capital and returns, and maybe I'm just reading too much into tea
leaves because investors are very curious. The authorization for the $5 billion is through 2026, you said during
your prepared remarks and tell me if I'm being too ticky-tacky, but you said initially target $5 billion for the
remainder of the year, and I guess investors are wondering about timing, and I know someone had already asked,
Ken had already asked about capital priorities, but what's the timing in terms of fulfilling that $5 billion authority?
And as I think about returns, I know you'll probably tell us more during fall conference season, but initially this
franchise together with TIH had an ROTCE potential in the low 20s. With TIH out, could you still achieve like a
high teens ROTCE? And I'm sure you will get more details during fall conference season.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, just to correct one thing. We said [ph] sort of a billion (00:48:16) through the remainder of this year,
and we'll sort of start the next year. And the reason to put the authorization of up to and make it through 2026 is
just to give us that kind of flexibility in terms of how we think about that. So, we're going to calibrate that against
our growth opportunities and where we see an ability to invest in our franchise, and we're going to be disciplined
about it. So, and then as I mentioned earlier, remember, this is with a really strong dividend as well. So, I think
you can't talk about one without talking about the other in terms of total return to shareholders. So, I think our
unique capability to have a really good return to shareholders over the – certainly near-term and medium-term
from the dividend buyback is actually quite significant. And then you put on top of that our ability to earn and earn
profitably and grow our business.

So, I think that's – we're trying to look at all of this in the big mix. As it relates to ROTCE specifically, yeah, I
mean, the past numbers are the past numbers. We sort of have to start from the business model that we have
now. Again, we're going to give a little more guidance on that with a little more specificity as we get towards the
end of the year as you mentioned. I think we'll have a little more knowledge as to sort of overall capital
requirements. And while Basel may not be complete, I think we might have a better picture of where we might be
and what the sort of CET1 base might be that we'd operate from and think about how to put all those mixes
together as it relates to growth as well. So, irrespective of the target itself, the growth to the target I think is a
really compelling proposition for Truist.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
A bit of a follow-up on last question with Erika regarding Capital. I put together the $500 million that you're looking
for in the buybacks and the dividend. It looks like you're, for the most part, returning earnings, quarterly earnings
to investors at least for the rest of this year. And RWA doesn't change; that means you've got the CET1 stable
where it is today. I know you're probably not – you didn't put a target CET1 out. I'm going to guess you're going to
highlight that we need the capital rules to put that out there. But is that a fair conclusion, that 11.6% is essentially
what we should anticipate as we roll through the rest of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, I think that's roughed out. You could see us sort of sliding sideways for a while for the reasons you
mentioned. You're right, I mean, you take the $500 million buyback and, call it, $700 million or so dividend. You're
approximately at – this is rough earnings, right? And you're right, we don't expect significant ROA improvement or
decline over the period. I'll just say this. I mean – and you mentioned sort of CET1 target, Bill referred to it as well.
I think a couple things just to think about there. One, we like operating with a higher level of capital in today's
world. One, affords us the right, we think, strength and resiliency and ability to sort of react to the world.
Importantly, we've got a growth agenda. We're focused on prosecuting. That's company-wide. You feel that with

any – especially frontline, but really across the whole company. And then, Bill mentioned sort of the capability to
return capital, and that can come in various forms.
But, yeah, I think modeling us somewhat flat short-term. But again, we – our expectation is that we'll begin to grow
RWAs next year, and so that's how we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. And then on the paydowns that you experienced in the C&I book, how much of that did you capture in the
capital markets business? In other words, if folks are terming out and paying down C&I, is that – are we seeing a
majority recaptured in the fee line? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's hard to do that calculation sort of perfectly, and we spend a lot of time thinking about it. But if you sort of
look at the overall line, this was one of our best DCM quarters in a really long time, so our capture rate is really
high. It's hard to put an exact percentage on that because there are puts and takes and would you have gotten it
otherwise and was it related to this side or the other. But it's really high and it's reflected in our overall DCM
growth.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. [indiscernible] (00:53:36) Just touch on credit a little bit. I know you added modestly to the loan
loss reserve, and it looks like much of that was on the office side. Wanted to get your thoughts there in terms of
what you're seeing right now in terms of credit progression, what are the areas that you're seeing some
weakening. You had some pressure on delinquencies and non-accruals. And could that justify incremental
modest additions to the reserve from here, or could you see it stable or even some releases from this point?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Vice Chair & Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, John, this is Clarke. As Mike and Bill said, we were very pleased with the overall asset quality for the
quarter. And we generally had stable delinquencies. We had flat NPLs and our losses were a touch lower,
particularly in this consumer area. So, we're still seeing the consumer side, the normalization that's occurring due
to higher rates, inflation, and the stimulus burn down, particularly for the lower-end consumer. So, we've been a
little careful there. Even in this quarter's reserve, we added a little bit for those lower-income consumer finance

areas. And then, you're right; on the CRE side and the office exposure, we still just want to make sure we're
addressing the uncertainty there. On the wholesale C&I side, we actually had, as Bill said, lower watch list. And
even though we're monitoring areas like the leverage book, consumer discretionary, senior care, transportation,
some of those more rate-sensitive areas, we've not had any big sector issues today that's been more episodic.
So, when we think about our reserves, we feel really good about the adequacy, where we are today, and it
reflects what we know today. So, unless there's a substantial change in the economic outlook or that level of
uncertainty in areas of stress like CRE office would emerge higher, we would expect our reserve levels for the
remainder of 2024 to be relatively stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. Thanks for that, Clarke. And then separately on the fee side, just I know you mentioned relatively
stable in terms of the non-interest income outlook for the third quarter. Maybe can you talk about fourth quarter a
little bit, how we should think about the progression into fourth quarter and into 2025? And then separately, as
part of that, on the investment banking side, you made some pretty solid talent acquisition and you cited the intent
that you're investing there and the progress you've made. Can you maybe just talk to us about is the buildout
ongoing, is there a focused effort to upscale the investment banking business even more in terms of the reach
and breadth of the business and maybe what's the long-term revenue contribution from that business that you
anticipate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Maybe I'll start with the latter, Mike, and then I'll turn it over to you [indiscernible] (00:56:35), if that's okay. So, the
buildout of the investment banking business has been decades-plus, so this isn't sort of a new thing and sort of it
has been consistent. I think the way you described it is exactly right. We'll continue to build where we have
relevance, where we have opportunity, and so we can be competitive and win in our markets. I think the part that
gets missed, that was investment we're making around the investment banking business. So, this is the
investment that we're making with our commercial teams and our middle market teams and expanding their
knowledge and capability to talk to clients about the things that are available to them. And so, think about the
amount of clients in our commercial business that are now private equity owned and our capability to be relevant
in those discussions and help them along that flight path.
So, investment's not just in the business itself, but it's in everything that surrounds the business and in support of.
We like the pace that we're growing, and I think we've had a really good CAGR. If you sort of go back over time
and look at the CAGR of that business, you'd sort of say that's a really good growth pattern. Importantly, we're
doing it profitably, which is also important, so we have a really good efficiency of that business, certainly on a
relative basis, and we want to keep all of those in check. I mean, we don't want to grow faster than the market.
We want to grow coincident with the opportunity that we have within our markets. We want to do it profitably, and
we want to do it sustainably. So, we want to have a little less variability relative to that business, so it's tied to
more of our core client capability than the vagaries of a particular market. Mike, there was a...

Operator: The next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, not a new question, but it goes back to your efficiency ratio and your expense guide and you mentioned
higher in the third quarter and maybe any preview for next year or how you're thinking about that. And that's partly
in the context, there's a Bloomberg story out saying that 11 of the 22 large banks fall short on operational risk
according to the OCC. Now, that's not confirmed by the OCC. There's no specific companies given. I know you're
not allowed to say what your regulatory ratings are. But if you or any other bank did have a deficient operational
risk rating, what would that mean? Would it mean, I don't know, what would that mean? Are you able to say if you
had ever been in that position in the past five years? I know you had some operational issues that you worked
through. And I also know, Bill, that your purpose is being open every day for your clients and employees and your
community.
So, I know you put that as a very high priority. So what degree has that hurt the efficiency in the past few years?
And to what degree could that still be a drag on efficiency going ahead? Thanks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Mike, you asked and answered part of your question as it relates to what we'll comment on and not
comment on. But look, I've said very consistently actually since the day Truist was formed, the size and
complexity of our organization, we're going to invest in our risk framework. We're going to invest in a durable risk
framework so we can stay competitive. We can stay appropriate with our regulators. And that's always been part
of this expense profile. So, I think even in today's prepared remarks, I mean, I'm always consistent with that. And I
think everybody's got to stay in that mode. Post of March of last year, irrespective of anybody's ratings, there was
just an increased focus on creating a durable, risk profile. So, we're going to continue to be in that mode. I can't
see that changing short-term, medium-term, or long-term. Are there peaks and valleys in that as you go up? Yes,
does it increase proportionally, absolutely.
I mean, I just think that's the price of being in our business and also the importance of creating a durable,
sustainable risk framework for a company of our size and a company of our opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, the $20 billion market cap question relates to the last part of your answer is for a company of our size, so I'm
just wondering, and it's an ongoing wonder, to what degree does that investment in the risk framework hurt Truist
disproportionately versus banks larger than your size, and how has that changed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, there are efficient frontiers, is the way, Mike that I like to talk about it. There're efficient frontiers and
where you are on the efficient frontier relative to that. Today, I feel like we're at a good place. So, we're at a good
place in terms of the investments that we need and should make relative to our company our size, and our ability
to return and have an efficient company relative to that. So, I think we're at a good place. But that efficient frontier
moves. So you always have to be flexible and think about that in the context of where it moves, and we're
conscious of that. So, today, I feel like we're at a good place. By the way, we merged our companies because we
thought we were at a different place and that that was going to be more complex, and we needed to have a
company of the size and scale sort of seen.
I mean, we didn't project March of last year, in fairness, but understanding that the complexity and the durability
and the investments needed to create that kind of risk platform was going to be needed. So that efficient frontier, I
think we're at a good place on it, but it does move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And last short follow up, the definition of good place as it relates to 2025, I know you usually don't give guidance
for a few quarters from now, but other banks have mentioned record NII, positive operating leverage, lower
expenses next year, can you give us a sneak peek of good place as it relates to 2025 financials?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, our sneak peek is the momentum we're creating right now. So that's the sneak peek. And we want
to continue to do that. Mike, you and I have talked about this. I mean, we have a strong focus on positive
operating leverage. So, all of our businesses have plans that are focused on positive operating leverage. That's

what they try to build over time. The controllable, more controllable factor over that is on the expense side right
now. And I'm really pleased with the progress we're making and expect to continue to have that kind of discipline
going forward. Those expenses will better reflect the revenue opportunity that we see in next year. So, be assured
that we've got to focus on creating that, but also be confident that we're building momentum. And I think this order
is good evidence of that. And our guidance for the rest of the year is good evidence of that.

Operator: The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just a quick follow up, Bill, on your response to Mike's question. As we think about – I just want to make sure we
understand this correctly. As we think about next year, ex any sort of revenue momentum taking sort of the top
line higher, should we expect expenses like the Street's expecting about $2.9 billion to $3 billion per quarter in
expense on rate continuing in 2025, is that fair to assume all else equal, absent sort of revenue growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks. I'm not going to give expense guidance for next year, just to say, confidence that we'll be focused
on positive operating leverage, confidence that we've got great expense discipline, and expenses will more
parallel the revenue opportunity. So if we see the investments that we're making, better growth opportunities in
our markets, we're going to take advantage of that. And if that requires a requisite expense increase, then we'll do
that. But that'll all be in the appropriate context of focus on positive operating leverage and efficient company that
has high returns.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Noted. And just one quick follow-up, maybe, if you could remind us, post sort of the acquisition integration, where
we stand in terms of any big tech upgrades coming on the deposit and lending platforms as we think about the
next year or two? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean, all that's been factored into the discussions that we have. I mean, our ability, this year, particularly
to invest a lot in the payment side, is all predicated on the existing platforms that we have, the advent of the use

of API's have been really, really great opportunities to continue to invest, we had huge investments in our lending
portfolios as part of the merger. So, there's no like one big stair step, sequenced investment, these are continuous
investments in our platform and capabilities over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And is it safe to assume that from a tech platform standpoint, Truist is not at a disadvantage relative to peers who
probably have not done deals and just been working on – there's an impression out there that you have a lot more
sort of heavy lifting to do there that's put you back, sounds like that's not the case, but just wanted to confirm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, the momentum we've seen in the last several quarters, the impression from our clients is that we have a
really good platform. So, our acquisition of clients, our performance metrics, client satisfaction scores, all the
things that we look in terms of, how do clients think about us is real positive and continuing.

Operator: We will take our last question today from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, thanks for squeezing in. You kind of implied the loans and deposit balances might be down a little
bit again in 3Q, if I heard that correctly. And they were down a little bit in 2Q here. Just thoughts on where they
bottom. And I understand like when we're looking at industry data where there's less than 1% loan growth, like
we're talking about really small numbers. But it seems like you're still kind of lagging the H8 data a little bit. And
it's understandable given how much has been going on the company and we talked about spending more in
marketing and hiring people, but just thoughts on kind of where those level out and you start tracking the H8 data
a little bit more. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt. Thanks for the question. Maybe just taking loans first, we're hopeful we'll see some relief. We were
down a little less than a percent this quarter average. In the third quarter, I think, again, base case probably
expected to be down, maybe not quite as much. We'd love to see that be different. But that's sort of what we're
thinking about, and then hopefully kind of stable, from there. Same on deposits. Actually, deposits a little lower,
perhaps, in the third. We mentioned that we felt like we had some outperformance in the second quarter. We did,
late in the quarter, just like a lot of others, some of the just sort of seasonality in tax payments. We saw, balance
was a little lower at the end of the quarter. That's not unusual. So, we'll probably expect a little bit of pressure in
the third quarter as well, but again, even that's stabilizing in the fourth. So, think down a touch in the third for both,
and then hopefully stable in the fourth-ish.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2024
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as you think about, call it restarting kind of the loan deposit engine internally,
you did allude to the marketing and hiring people, but what's like the process of just getting the message out to
kind of existing employees, like, you got all this capital, you got all this liquidity, like, you could be front-footed,
And I know it takes time to kind of flip the switch again, especially in an environment where there's still little kind of
growth out there, but just touch on a couple of things you're doing to drive that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure. Rest assured that our teammates are highly focused. And there are places that we can dial more
specifically, and you sort of seen it. Our consumer production was up 37% over a linked quarter. Premier banking,
lending numbers sort of similar per branch production, those type things. So, the places that we can dial in a little
bit. And then on the wholesale side, it's just a lot about training. It's a lot about hiring. It's a lot about market
opportunity. It's a lot about dialogue with clients. So, we look at all the pitches kind of approach, and we're seeing
really good activity. But our teammates are on offense. Let there be no confusion. I mean, our teammates are on
offense. They are not in a defensive position. Trust me, the shift for them happened quite quickly. You know there
was a – you could hear it and feel it in terms of momentum. People are attracted to come to work for our franchise
for some of the same reasons, as we have the capital and capability to invest in the future.
So, rest assured that your point's right. I mean, the battleship, it's hard to turn, but in terms of its direction, clear
direction, clear communication, and clear focus from our teams. Thank you.
