Q4 2020 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2021
Thank you, Valerie, and good afternoon. Welcome to Heartland's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
We appreciate everyone joining us today as we discuss the company's performance for the fourth quarter of 2020
and for the full year. For the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the call over
to Heartland's President and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance and our COVID-19 response.
Then Bryan McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide additional color around Heartland's results. Also joining us
today is Nathan Jones, EVP and Chief Credit Officer, who will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Bruce Lee and Bryan McKeag will share with you the many things we are doing to support, protect, and care for
our employees, customers, shareholders, and communities.
So now onto the financial highlights for 2020 and the fourth quarter. While I'm very pleased to report that based
on all the challenges of 2020, the continued low interest rates, states shutdowns, and the overall impact of the
pandemic, we still had a very good year. Fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $37.8
million or $0.98 per diluted common share.
Net income before our preferred dividend was $39.8 million, a 5% increase over 12/31/2019. For the full year
2020, net income available to common shareholders was $133.5 million and earnings per diluted common share
was $3.57. Annualized return on average tangible common equity was 12.77% and the annualized return on
average assets was 0.92%. Our tangible common equity ratio ended the quarter at 7.81%, as a result of the two
acquisitions, totaling $2.3 billion in assets. Bryan McKeag will provide more detail on our capital ratios.
The net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis at 3.55% for the quarter was unchanged from the prior
quarter. And Bruce and Bryan will share more detail in their comments on margin. Book value and tangible book
value per common share continue to increase, ending the year at $46.77 and $32.07, respectively, now that's a
9% increase over 12/31/2019. Also during the fourth quarter, $12 million of the $17 million in loan loss
provisioning was tied to our $2.3 billion of acquired assets. And Bryan McKeag will expand more on our provision
for the quarter.
Well, with respect to the balance sheet, assets reached a new record high at $17.9 billion and we achieved
growth across all categories for the year. Assets were up $4.7 billion. Net loans were up $1.7 billion, investments
were up $2.9 million, non-deposit maturities which we're focused on up $.3.9 billion, and equity was up $501
million, and our efficiency ratio at 56.65% was down 9% for the year.
Moving on to M&A, as we discussed last quarter, we closed on our largest acquisition ever, the AimBank
transaction in West Texas. AimBank merged with and into Heartland's Lubbock, Texas-based subsidiary. With
this acquisition, FirstBank & Trust is now Heartland's largest bank with over $3 billion in assets. The systems
conversion is set for mid-February. In 2021, we are forecasting approximately $34 million in after-tax income from
Aim which includes two-thirds of our $12 million in after-tax cost saves. This transaction's approximately 10%
accretive to EPS.
Also in early December, our Arizona Bank & Trust bank in Phoenix, Arizona completed its purchase and
assumption of the four Johnson Bank Phoenix branches. Our simultaneous close in first time ever virtual
conversion went extremely well, adding approximately $416 million in deposits, $151 million in loans, and $235
million in assets under management to Arizona Bank & Trust's trust department. This transaction took Arizona
Bank & Trust total assets to over $1.5 billion. And in 2021, we're forecasting approximately $6.5 million in after-tax
income from these branches. This transaction is approximately 5% accretive to EPS.
Well, per our M&A strategy, we continue to prioritize both in-market and larger acquisitions. Acquisitions
contribute to a number of companywide goals. In-market acquisitions provide greater cost saves and cost

takeouts and synergies and create greater market dominance for our member banks. Currently, our member
banks have achieved top 10 deposit market share in 26 of our 38 MSAs and top 5 deposit market share in 12 of
our 38 MSAs.
Acquisitions have significantly increased our asset size and earnings base. The increased asset size from
accretive acquisitions combined with Operation Customer Compass is a more efficient and scalable operating
platform significantly contributed to the lowering of our efficiency ratio.
As I've said in the past, our priority has been to expand in our current footprint and work toward our goal of $1
billion in assets in each state where we operate. Currently, 10 of our 11 banks have assets exceeding $1 billion,
and we continue to have a deep pipeline of attractive prospects with a number of active opportunities.
Now for the 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend, at this month's meeting, Heartland's board of
directors approved a $0.22 per common share dividend payable February 26, 2021 to shareholders of record on
February 12, 2021.
Through many recessions including the Great Recession and now the pandemic, we've had 40 consecutive years
of increased or level quarterly dividends, a record beyond many of our peers. The board also approved our
preferred dividend of $175 payable on April 15, 2021 to preferred shareholders of record on March 31, 2021.
Now before I transition comments over to Bruce, I want to highlight a recent addition to the Heartland board.
Christopher S. Hylen will serve as an Independent Director on the Heartland board of directors. With more than
25 years of technology and business leadership experience, Chris is a high-caliber executive who brings a special
depth of knowledge and perspective to the Heartland board. We will benefit from his executive level leadership,
his vast experience in using technology to enable extraordinary client experiences, and his laser focus on
delivering value to clients and shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the
company's operating performance, COVID-19 response, and credit. Bruce?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon. As I look at the strong results from our fourth quarter and the year as a whole,
I'm once again reminded how proud I am of the teams across Heartland in each of our member banks. We've
demonstrated our commitment to serving our customers and communities while prioritizing the health and safety
of our employees. It's their strength and resiliency that allowed us to endure challenges and positioned us for
growth in 2021 and beyond.
I have said throughout the pandemic that Heartland would emerge stronger than before, and we're doing just that.
We continue to drive down costs through disciplined execution of strategic initiatives, improved processes, and by
leveraging scale. We completed two acquisitions that further diversified our assets and increased our presence in
important growth markets of Phoenix and West Texas. With these two acquisitions, over 60% of Heartland's
assets are now in the west and the southwest regions where we see the greatest economic growth in the US.
With our strategic focus on growth, expense discipline, geographic footprint, and proven M&A track record, we are
uniquely positioned to prosper in a rapidly evolving and consolidating financial services space.

In the fourth quarter, Heartland's total assets grew to $17.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion in the quarter,
primarily from acquisitions. Assets grew $4.7 billion or 36% for the year. Efficiency ratio for the quarter was
54.93%, our lowest ever for the fourth quarter and 538 basis points lower than a year ago. For the year, efficiency
ratio was 56.65%, 585 basis points lower than 2019 and exceeding our own high expectations. Our ability to drive
efficiency while strategically investing for growth and enriching the customer experience continues to differentiate
us. We delivered another strong quarter of deposit growth organically and through acquisitions.
Total deposits ended the quarter just below $15 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion from the linked quarter. This
includes $2.1 billion of deposits acquired at fair value in the AimBank and Johnson Bank branch transactions.
Excluding these acquired deposits, total deposits increased $127 million from the linked quarter and $1.8 billion,
or 17% for the year. Non-time deposits totaled $13.7 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 17%, during the quarter.
Excluding acquisitions, non-time deposits increased $191 million, or 2%, from the linked quarter. For the year,
non-time deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 39%. Excluding acquisitions, non-time deposits increased $2.1 billion,
or 21%.
Our deposit mix remains enviable, with 38% in non-interest-bearing accounts and 92% in non-time account
balances. Our disciplined deposit pricing has reduced total deposit costs to 14 basis points for the quarter, down
47 basis points from 61 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning to credit metrics, I am pleased to report that we continue to see stable credit quality. Non-performing
loans represented 88 basis points of total loans at the end of the quarter, a slight decrease from 89 basis points in
the linked quarter. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets also decreased to 53 basis points from
55 basis points in the linked quarter while the real estate increased to $6.6 million from $5.1 million in the linked
quarter, primarily due to assets acquired in the AimBank acquisition.
Our delinquency ratio remains below the most recent five-year average despite an increase of 6 basis points from
the linked quarter to 23 basis points. Non-pass rated loans increased from 8.7% in the third quarter to 10.8% in
the fourth quarter, a combination of acquired non-pass loans and some downgrades in the legacy portfolio. The
ratio remains at relatively low level. Substandard loans decreased to 44% of total non-pass loans, compared to
47% for the previous quarter.
Lastly, net loan charge-offs for the quarter were $216,000 or 1 basis point, compared to $21.3 million or 92 basis
points in the linked quarter. We believe that the two previous charge-offs from large commercial borrowers in the
third quarter were an exception, and these metrics reinforce that. We continue to work closely with our customers,
and if necessary, we'll take proactive steps to help them stabilize their positions.
We are pleased with the overall credit portfolio, remain cautiously optimistic in 2021 based on how our portfolios
performed in 2020, and are encouraged by the prospects for an additional round of government stimulus and the
continued rollout of COVID vaccines.
Turning to commercial. Excluding PPP-related loans, organic growth was up slightly from the linked quarter. We
saw fourth quarter organic loan growth in owner occupied real estate of $99 million, non-owner occupied of $43
million and commercial and industrial of $44 million, creating strong momentum for 2021. Construction declined
$155 million largely due to shifts to owner occupied and non-owner occupied real estate.
Including acquisitions, our commercial loan portfolio increased by 8% for the year and 14% from the linked
quarter. Our remaining portfolios including acquisitions: agriculture increased $206 million; residential mortgage
increased $139 million; and consumer loans increased $29 million for the linked quarter. Heartland is proud to

have helped nearly 5,000 small businesses obtain loans during the first draw of PPP, helping provide a critical
lifeline in our communities. Six member banks were top 10 PPP lenders in their respective markets, and we are
actively participating in the second draw that opened to our banks on January 19. We've already received more
than 1,200 second draw applications as of today.
In the PPP first draw, we only accepted applications from current customers. Based on our successful execution
in the first round, we're extending our reach for the new program. In addition to current customers, we will offer
PPP loans to high-priority prospective clients and minority-owned and underserved commercial prospects,
providing an opportunity to build new relationships, demonstrate our capabilities, and serve our communities.
In the third quarter, the SBA began to process PPP forgiveness applications. As of mid-January, more than half of
our borrowers had submitted forgiveness applications, representing $688 million of our $1.2 billion in PPP loans,
excluding acquisitions. About 1,500 loans have already been forgiven and funded by the SBA.
Investments we've made in Customer Compass, our multiyear strategic initiative, have enabled commercial teams
at each of our banks to process applications efficiently and faster using our best-in-class Salesforce CRM and
nCino platforms. Overall, we've seen a 30% decrease in the time from loan application to funding, improving
speed to market and the customer experience.
In December, we closed the AimBank acquisition, making FirstBank & Trust Heartland's largest bank with more
than $3 billion in assets and the fifth largest bank in the thriving West Texas market. We're scheduled to complete
system conversion in February. Also in December, Arizona Bank & Trust completed its acquisition of Johnson
Bank's four banking centers in the Phoenix market. The close and simultaneous conversion raised Arizona Bank
&Trust assets to $1.5 billion, enhancing its already strong foundation.
I am thrilled to welcome AimBank employees to FirstBank & Trust, Johnson Bank employees to Arizona Bank &
Trust, and both teams to Heartland. These strategic acquisitions in growth markets have provided scale, added
talent, and created the opportunity to bring new products and services to existing AimBank and Johnson Bank
customers. We will also consolidate three AimBank branches based on proximity to existing branches in their
respective markets.
Consumer behaviors have changed into early investments in Operation Customer Compass. We can provide
customers the in-person and digital options they want to interact with us. In-branch transactions have decreased
35% from pre-COVID levels. We've seen a steady rise in the use of our mobile and online banking platforms,
increasing 16%. We installed more than 100 new ATMs in the second half of the year. Small business customers
have appreciated the enhanced deposit capabilities, and overall ATM deposits have increased 35% from the
previous quarter.
Given this ongoing shift to digital, we continue to rationalize our branch footprint to more efficiently serve our
customers. We consolidated three branches in 2020 and will consolidate five more this month, plus three
AimBank branches. An additional 10% of our branches are under review. We continue to operate under our
pandemic management plan, with employee and customer health as our top priority. Our banks are open for
business, and we're providing our customers with the high level of service they value from our banks.
Employees who can work from home do so, while those who come into bank locations and offices are on rotating
teams to limit potential exposure. Heartland's diverse geographic footprint continues to be a strength during the
pandemic. Our banking centers are serving our customers in lobbies, drive-thrus, and by appointment. We'll

continue to adapt to local conditions and are confident in our ability to operate in this environment as long as
needed.
2020 was a year when many in our communities were in need, and Heartland provided $1.5 million of financial
support. In April, we contributed $1.2 million to organizations responding to challenges created by COVID-19. In
October, we donated more than $260,000 to high-needs schools in our markets, providing teachers money to
purchase technology, supplies, and materials to help students learn in a safe and healthy environment. These
dollars and our employees' volunteer hours made a meaningful difference and enriched lives in our communities.
Lessons learned in 2020 will serve us, our customers, and our communities well. The strategic investments we
began making in 2019 allowed us to pivot, act quickly, and meet the challenges of the past year.
We established new ways to collaborate and connect with each other and our customers. We deepened existing
relationships, established new ones, and remained focused on the customer experience. We lowered our costs,
delivered new digital capabilities, improved our speed to market, and continued to invest for the future. We are
optimistic and well-positioned for growth in 2021. We are open and ready to serve our customers and
communities as they emerge from the pandemic.
Now I will turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Heartland's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our
performance and financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today with an overview of earnings per share, which was reported at
$0.98 this quarter. This quarter includes three significant items: first, a provision for credit losses of $11.9 million
was recorded for purchased non-credit deteriorated, commonly called non-PCD loans, and unfunded loan
commitments acquired in the AimBank and Johnson branch transactions; second, acquisition and integration
costs of $2.2 million were incurred related to these acquisitions; and third, we recorded $4.6 million of additional
fee income in conjunction with the forgiveness of approximately 20% of our PPP loan balances during the quarter.
Excluding these items, Heartland's earnings per share would have been $0.20 higher, or $1.18. So again this
quarter, core earnings were strong.
Before I go into my detailed comments, I want to remind you that our updated fourth quarter investor presentation
is available in the IR website – the IR section of our website.
So I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which totaled $17.1 million this quarter, and includes
the previously mentioned $11.9 million provision on non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments in our two
acquisitions. The remaining $5.2 million of provision related to the legacy bank and reflects the following
components. First, legacy loan balances, excluding PPP, in total declined $91 million, and unfunded commitments
declined $65 million in fourth quarter. Second, we continued to have some legacy loan downgrades and have a
small increase in reserves for non-accrual loans. Third, consensus economic forecasts continued to show modest
improvement. However, the economic outlook factors and components used to develop the allowance were not
changed, as it is Heartland's assessment that a significant level of economic uncertainty remained at year-end.
And lastly, net charge-offs were minimal this quarter at $216,000.
Heartland also booked a $12.3 million increase directly to the allowance for loan losses for the purchased credit
deteriorated, or again, referred to as PCD loans, in our two acquisitions. In total, all the items I just mentioned
resulted in a reserve build of $29.2 million for the quarter that was primarily related to acquired loans. So at
quarter-end, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $131.6 million, or 1.31% of total loans. And the
7

(HTLF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2021
allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was $15.3 million, or 16 basis points of total loans.
Together, these two allowances result in a total allowance for lending-related credit losses of $146.9 million, or
1.47% of total loans.
When the PPP loan balances are excluded, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses stands at 1.62%
of loans. In addition, at year-end, we had unamortized purchased loan valuations on our balance sheet totaling
$33.2 million, or 37 basis points of total loans excluding PPP.
Moving to the rest of the balance sheet, investments grew $1.2 billion this quarter, primarily due to acquisitions,
and now comprise 35% of assets, with a tax equivalent yield of 2.38%, a duration of just under six years, and
generate $65 million of average monthly cash flow. Borrowings decreased $206 million to end the quarter at $625
million, or 3.5% of assets. At year-end, our banking network had approximately $4.1 billion of unused borrowing
capacity. The tangible common equity ratio declined 22 basis points to 7.81% at year-end. Excluding the 57 basis
points decline from our two acquisitions, the ratio would have increased 35 basis points and remained well over
8%. Heartland's regulatory capital ratios also remained strong, with common equity tier 1 at just over 10.9%, and
total risk-based at just over 14.7%. So Heartland's growing balance sheet continues to be strong and well-
positioned.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $132.6 million this quarter, or $10.1 million higher
than the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.55%, or flat compared
to last quarter, as a 16 basis points decline in investment yield was offset by a 20 basis point increase in loan
yield and a 4 basis point drop in interest costs. The increase in loan yield was driven by the recognition of an
additional $4.6 million of fees on PPP loan forgiveness, as I previously mentioned. This quarter, the net interest
margin includes 10 basis points of purchase accounting accretion, which was unchanged from the prior quarter. In
addition, we exited the year with approximately $19.3 million of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on our
books.
Net interest income totaled $32.6 million for the quarter, up $1.4 million from last quarter, as the gain on sale of
loans declined $1.8 million on lower seasonal mortgage loan activity, while total security gains increased $1.5
million compared to last quarter. In addition, service charges were $1 million higher this quarter, primarily
reflecting one month of run rate from our new acquisitions.
Shifting to noninterest expense, noninterest expenses remained well managed, totaling $99.3 million this quarter,
up $8.9 million, largely due to our new acquisitions. When excluding acquisition, integration, restructuring, and tax
credit costs, and asset gains and losses, Heartland's core expenses increased $6 million to $92.6 million,
compared to $86.6 million last quarter. This increase primarily reflects one month of run rate costs from our new
acquisitions. The one specific expense line item I would mention is losses on assets, which totaled $2.6 million
this quarter and primarily relate to write-downs on several branches as part of Heartland's ongoing branch
optimization program. As this program continues to progress, we may have additional branch write-downs over
the next several quarters.
So as we exit 2020 and look ahead to 2021, we believe Heartland is well-positioned to deliver strong results next
year and would provide the following comments regarding 2021. First, the loan growth rate ex-PPP is expected to
be in the mid-single digits, with lower first half growth and then more robust growth in the back half. A modest
deposit growth rate in the low single digits is expected, with higher first half growth from government stimulus and
then some runoff in the second half. The remaining round of PPP forgiveness will happen largely in the first half of
2021. The new round of PPP is yet to be determined; however we're off to a good start as Bruce mentioned.

Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2021
The NIM ex-PPP will have some modest pressure. However, with higher fee income continuing on PPP
forgiveness in the first half and higher purchase accounting accretion, net interest margin is projected to be
slightly under the current all-in TA rate, tax adjusted rate that is, and be in the 3.5% range for next year. Provision
for credit losses are not expected to exceed $35 million, assuming a firming economy in the second half of 2021.
Mortgage banking income is expected to decline by 15% year-over-year. Deposits and service fees are expected
to increase over 20% next year due to recent acquisitions and a recovery from a poor first half in 2020. Wealth
and brokerage fees are expected to show mid-single-digit percentage growth. Core expenses are expected to
increase to $104 million to $105 million next quarter, reflecting a full quarter of our new acquisitions, and then
conversion and all cost saves realized will fall – in the second quarter will fall to the $102 million to $103 million
range, and then settle into the $101 million range thereafter.
On a full-year basis, we expect the efficiency ratio to be in the 56% to 57% range. AimBank integration and
conversion costs are expected to be $2 million to $2.5 million in Q1 2021, and we believe a 22% tax rate is a
reasonable full-year run rate, assuming no tax law changes from the new administration in D.C. Lastly, we expect
our TCE ratio to climb back above 8%, as we get about 20 to 30 basis points of increase per quarter. However,
the new round of PPP loans may weigh on the ratio during the first half of 2021.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce.

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. Largely when you look at the nonaccruals, it was actually – if you look at it from an NPL
standpoint, we actually had a reduction from a legacy Heartland perspective of almost $4.5 million. So when you
actually take them together, what we really saw was the overall increase that you're seeing today, which is a little
bit closer to just north of $7 million. So really it's a positive story overall as we continue to work with our
customers, especially given some of the headwinds we're all facing today. As Bruce said, we're very optimistic or
cautiously optimistic about the credit performance, and continue to remain so as we look forward. Bryan, would
you like to add some additional clarity onto some of those numbers as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A

No, I think you got them pretty close. I would just say there's a table on page at least 17 on my printout of our

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...basically shows that our nonperformers went up about $9 million, and we acquired almost $13 million in our
acquisitions. So, that's where Nathan was saying had we not had the acquisition, our nonperformers would've
actually gone down.

Great. Yeah, I just hadn't had time to look at the table. Thanks. Maybe just overview on capital then, you saw the

looking to preserve that in the short run, but just thoughts on – I heard about the M&A pipeline but [indiscernible]
(38:42) what do we look for in 2021 in all types of capital from M&A? I guess we should be set on dividend,
anything – any thoughts on buyback? Thanks.

Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think, Jeff, you had it pretty much right. I mean, we'll grow back up, as I said, through 8.5% just with
earnings projected for next year and the balance sheet growth that we have projected. Now that excludes any
acquisitions, so – and with the acquisitions, we typically will issue stock as part of that. So, I think you might see in
the first half of the year, things will be a little bit tighter especially if we do this next round of PPPs. So our TCE
could stay relatively flat and then really kind of move up in the last half of the year. Earnings – our payout ratio
right now at $0.22 per share is right around 20% of earnings, give or take a little bit. So, we'll see how earnings go
as to whether we could increase that some more. We'll see how M&A goes to see how we need to utilize that
capital. And right now we don't see any share buybacks in the near horizon, but we'll see how things progress.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And one last one for you, Bryan, while I got you, just I didn't hear a total noninterest income. I think you
piecemealed it, but is there a run rate with kind of all-in acquired loans which you're looking for in the first quarter
of the noninterest income?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think – let me just shuffle a piece of paper here. If you kind of look at the quarter, so if you back out the
gains and losses, I think the quarter is about $30 million, which really is about the same as what it was the quarter
before. So we've been running about $30 million of noninterest income. Two more months of Aim and Johnson
should add about $2 million, but probably see a little bit of seasonality. So I'd probably say, in the first quarter, I
would say you'd probably be somewhere in that $31 million to $32 million. And then you'd probably come up with
some seasonality and better mortgage fees coming through, probably up to $32 million or $33 million as you go
across the mid-quarters, and maybe back down to $30 million or something like that. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And you said mortgage for the full year down 15% year-over-year, but just try to bake in that
seasonality?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. I would say...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...kind of just last year and kind of – or maybe drop them all above that 15%, you probably get about the right
seasonality to that.

Great. I'll step back. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, everyone. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Andrew.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just want to touch base on the loan growth forecasts. I know in recent years, growing organically has been a little
bit challenging. Some of that's been by design though. I mean, what gives you confidence? What are your
borrowers telling you right now that give you confidence that you'll be able to hit mid-single-digit growth this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Bruce. Our pipelines are reflecting that there's significantly increased activity. We
did get organic growth in the fourth quarter in the commercial portfolio. We also are running and focusing on the
consumer portfolio, so we don't think that we're going to run into those headwinds, and our applications during the
first quarter would reflect organic growth in the consumer portfolio. So we think between what we have in our
pipelines, and quite frankly in the last six months, we've hired new commercial leaders in 4 of our 11 markets, and
that is also boosting some of the pipeline activity. So between additions of talent sort of getting away from – or
learning to call in the COVID world, our pipelines are filling up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it, great. That's good to hear. Bryan, just on your margin outlook, what does that assume for, I guess, liquidity
there? I mean, that can be such a wildcard and a driver of it. I mean, I guess, what's the right average earning
asset types we're using, what are you guys seeing for deposit flows? And how large of a balance sheet should we
be looking at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I think that the balance sheet will go up a little bit, but remember, there's PPP in there that will be paying
off. And then some will come back on. So it's really, I would say, a slightly growing [indiscernible] (43:54), but I
think we're up for net of – I would say we're going to probably be up $200,000, $300,000, $100 million just on
overall assets. But again, there's going to be lots of churning, right? Because we've got flow coming off of the
investment portfolio that we'd like to turn into loans rather than just grow the balance sheet, so I don't know that

you're going to have a hugely larger balance sheet than we have today, but hopefully a better mix of earning
assets [ph] to kind of help point the NIM (44:36).

Terry McEvoy Q

Good evening, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. So if I just look at Heartland's stock, it's up 50%, almost exactly since the end of September. And my question
is what are pricing expectations for banks that are $1 billion to $3 billion of assets that kind of fit that criteria?
Have pricing expectations kind of corresponded with publicly traded bank stocks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Terry, I would say they have moved up. It was pretty tough going there but we were at our lows, but I do believe
people are starting to say, if you're trading at X times earnings and X times tangible book, then can't we expect
something in that range or better?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And, Bryan, just want to clarify. The margin guidance of 3.50%, that incorporates the remaining PPP
fees from round one, as well as a step-up in anticipated accretion from the deals that closed in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Correct, yeah. It wouldn't have any PPP too because I'm not sure what that is yet. So, that's correct.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2021
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just last question here. I mean, in the press release, you've got here charge-offs could be
elevated given that they were just 1 basis point here in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts on charge-offs? I know,
Bryan, you talked about the provision, but the elevated, I won't say it scared me, but it caught my eyes as I read
the release.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I don't want...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Nathan, you want to comment on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. As we continue to work with our customers and really look at the cycle kind of what's coming, we do
realize, and certainly our allowance has been elevated to account for that. We've maintained a very conservative
approach. But I don't know if the word elevated is probably being used in the right term here. We're really just
looking at it from a perspective of where it has been. And just looking at over the next year, I'm thinking it's
probably going to stay more in that range. I think the guidance Bryan gave earlier was really around that $35
million. So seeing it elevated from this last quarter, I think, looking out next year, I think it's appropriate to probably
look at that range. Bryan, is there anything you'd like to add as far as additional color there as far as what you
gave as far as guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think what I probably would say, Terry, is we had I think 32 basis points for the full year this year but it was
real choppy. I think you're going to continue to see choppiness and hopefully it'll be better. But you could see it
pop up into that range again. A lot of that though, I think if we've done our reserving correctly under CECL, we
have a lot of that already reserved for and how we've already got some economic components in there. We've
been picking up the downgrades as those have been happening. So if those do end up in charge-offs, we've been
increasing in reserve as we go. So we could see some elevated. I think it's hard to say that they wouldn't go up
given that we're not out of the pandemic yet and we only had the 1 basis point this last quarter. So that's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And so, Terry, how I would maybe frame it, it's going to be elevated from historical levels of in that sort of 10-
basis-point range. Clearly 1 basis point was outstanding, and we're very pleased with that in the fourth quarter.
But we think it's going to be elevated from historical level. Probably a lot closer to the 30 to 35 basis points for the
year going forward if we had to give you specific guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great, appreciate that. Thank you.

Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the key there, Terry, is that we've already provided for it. So even though we have the net charge-offs,
they're a bit elevated over historic levels, we're not going to have to be providing for it. It's already in the reserves.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] You have a question from Damon DelMonte of KBW. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Hope everybody is doing well these days.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but just maybe broadly speaking on the outlook for M&A,
do you feel like the dialogue with potential targets has been increasing? And is it reasonable to expect one or
maybe two deals that to be announced here in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Damon, I would think that you could expect maybe two deals announced, but we would only have the
AimBank conversion which is going to take place mid-February, and then we probably the − anything else would
be converted in the third quarter. We might have two announcements but we'd probably push out the next
announcement into the first quarter of 2022. We have a number of Tier 1, Tier 2 projects that we need to get
done. So I would expect only two conversions this year: the AimBank conversion and maybe one additional one,
but you may hear about another opportunity announced.
There's still a pretty active group of prospects that we're working with right now. So you never know if you're going
to get him or not but there's some active opportunities that we're working on right now, and some of them have
advanced in time. One very nice acquisition we thought would be maybe coming around in the second half of this
year, and it seems to be advancing into the first half of this year now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And with respect to geographic focus, is one area of the footprint more attractive these days and present
better opportunities than others?

Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, we actually have relationships across all of our markets, as well as new markets, but as I've said in the past,
we really are focused on in-market transactions. They provide greater synergies and they give us more market
dominance in the markets we're in. So the one we're working on right now is midwest and the other one that I was
talking about or other two would be out west.

back over to Mr. Lee for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Valerie. In closing, Heartland is well-positioned for growth and has strong momentum. We begin 2021
with a balance sheet that grew $4.7 billion in the previous year. Net interest margin is in the 3.5% range, thanks to
our disciplined deposit pricing. Our credit profile is stable. We've consistently lowered our credit costs to deliver
our products and services. We expect ongoing benefits from Operation Customer Compass. We continue to
invest in technology and improve our processes to enhance the customer experience. We continue to invest in
talent that will drive growth, and recently added new commercial leaders at four of our member banks. We will
generate mid-single-digit organic loan growth in 2021. We'll maintain an efficiency ratio of below 57%. We expect
additional revenue and customer relationships from the second draw of PPP. We anticipate $40.5 million of net
income in 2021 from the two acquisitions we closed in December. And we continue to have a deep pipeline of
attractive M&A prospects with a number of active opportunities.
We're moving forward in 2021. We're stronger. We're more nimble. And together we are Heartland. Thank you for
joining us today. Our next quarterly conference call is scheduled for Monday, April 26. Have a great evening.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You
may all disconnect. Have a great day.
