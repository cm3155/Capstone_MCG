Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings
call. Synovus reported a loss of $0.16 in the second quarter of 2024, which included a previously announced
$257 million loss from the recent securities repositioning that was executed as a result of the capital benefits
derived from our risk-weighted asset optimization exercise.
However, adjusted earnings per share were $1.16 compared to $0.79 in the first quarter, while adjusted pre-
provision net revenue rose 20% from the prior quarter to $262 million. Adjusted revenue and earnings inflected
higher in the second quarter. Net interest income increased 4% from the prior quarter on 16 basis points of
sequential NIM expansion. Also, adjusted noninterest revenue jumped 9% sequentially, while adjusted
noninterest expense declined 5%. Moreover, our net charge-offs and nonperforming loans declined meaningfully
this quarter, and our liquidity and capital positions remain as strong as they've been in several years.
Our success and positive momentum are a direct result of the work of our talented team members. We are also
making progress in key initiatives and in further strengthening our value proposition for our clients. We continue to
attract talent in the expansion of our commercial and wealth lines of business. Our retail analytics platform has
translated into a better client experience and is delivering 60% increase in new revenue resulting from the insights
and leads generated. Our focus on the Business Owner Wealth Strategy is delivering a 52% conversion rate on
qualified referrals. Our growth in the current pipelines remain robust in treasury and payment solutions. Our
efforts to reduce fraud and operating losses have proven fruitful with year-to-date expenses down 11%.

And lastly, we saw a significant improvement in credit costs this quarter. In fact, our Community Bank line of
business ended the quarter and year-to-date in a net recovery position. So, our progress is broad-based and truly
a team effort.
In addition, as we've discussed in recent quarters, our focus remains firmly on execution while reducing
uncertainty in performance associated with the net interest margin and credit cost. The second quarter results
reflect our progress towards these goals.
Now let's turn to slide 3 for the highlights. As previously noted, net interest income increased 4% from the first
quarter as a result of 16 basis points of sequential net interest margin expansion. Despite funded production
increasing almost $500 million this quarter, period-end loans were down just over $200 million from the first
quarter. We continue to generate healthy and consistent loan growth in the middle market, CIB and specialty
commercial units. But payoff activity in senior housing and national accounts, as well as lower C&I utilization,
drove the overall decline in outstandings for the quarter.
Core deposits declined slightly in the second quarter, driven by a drop in noninterest-bearing deposits, offset by
growth in time deposits. Furthermore, we reduced brokered deposits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our team
remains highly focused on accelerating core funding generation through sales activities and product expansion.
Adjusted noninterest revenue increased 9% from the prior quarter, primarily from significant growth in capital
markets income. On a year-over-year basis, there was strong growth in commercial sponsorship income from the
expansion of card sponsorship business, as well as our partnership with GreenSky. Capital markets and treasury
and payment solutions fees also contributed to healthy year-over-year growth.
Adjusted noninterest expense was down 5% sequentially and relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Our 2023
cost initiatives, as well as ongoing diligence, have led to a modest core operating expense growth from a year
ago, while maintaining a level of strategic investments that positions Synovus well from a competitive standpoint
in order to drive long-term shareholder value. On the asset quality front, net charge-offs of 32 basis points were 9
basis points lower than the first quarter levels, while nonperforming loans declined by 22 basis points.
Lastly, we further bolstered our common equity Tier 1 ratio in the second quarter through solid earnings accretion
and balance sheet management, while still completing about $91 million of opportunistic share repurchases.
Common equity Tier 1 levels are the highest in over eight years at 10.62% and currently sit modestly above our
stated range of 10% to 10.5%.
Now I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the second quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?

Thank you, Kevin. Moving to slide 4, period-end loans were down $216 million from the prior quarter. Loan
production actually rose significantly from the first quarter, but was offset by payoffs, paydowns and continued
portfolio rationalization, as well as lower utilization from our larger corporate and specialty line clients. We
continue to maintain pricing discipline, as evidenced by loan spreads on new production which remain elevated
relative to the prior year.
Consistent with our focus on core client relationships, despite utilization headwinds, growth in middle market
commercial, CIB and specialty lines was $157 million or 5% annualized during the second quarter. During the first

half of 2024, we produced 8% annualized growth in these core commercial business lines, which we believe
should continue throughout the remainder of the year. Senior housing loans declined $196 million from the prior
quarter. There has been increased strength in the markets, as evidenced by higher levels of transaction and
refinancing activity over the last few quarters. That said, we anticipate more stable senior housing balances
throughout the remainder of 2024.
We also continue to strategically reduce our non-relationship lending within our national accounts portfolio, as well
as our third-party consumer loans, further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth. These balances
were down $223 million in the second quarter. In the second half of this year, third-party consumer loans should
continue to decline an estimated $60 million per quarter, while national account balances should be more stable.
We estimate we should see stable to higher total loans in the second half of 2024, with continued growth in our
key commercial segments.
Turning to slide 5, period-end core deposit balances were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, with somewhat
more stable mix shifts within the quarter. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances were down $387 million from the
prior quarter. However, average balances were more stable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. We
still see some further pressure on noninterest-bearing deposits, though the trends continue to suggest notable
slowing in the pace of decline in those balances.
Finally, brokered deposits declined $317 million or 6% from the first quarter, which is the fourth consecutive
quarter of contraction. Deposit costs were stable in the second quarter, up just 1 basis point from the prior
quarter. This equates to a cycle-to-date total deposit cost beta of approximately 49%, which was unchanged
compared to the first quarter. As we look at the back half of the year, we expect deposit costs to remain relatively
stable and are looking for broad-based deposit growth across our business segments, which should be supported
by seasonal tailwinds into the end of the year.
Moving to slide 6, net interest income was $435 million in the second quarter, which was an increase of 4% from
the first quarter. The second quarter benefited from various drivers, including improving loan yields, the residual
impact of first quarter hedge maturities and the securities repositioning in May. As we alluded to in the first
quarter, we also witnessed relative stabilization in deposit cost and mix trends, which resulted in a much more
modest headwind to interest expense. As we translate that to the margin, NIM expanded 16 basis points
sequentially to 3.2%.
This was primarily driven by the same factors which supported net interest income, along with a one-time positive
impact from our securities held to maturity reclassification, which served to reduce earning assets. As we look
forward to the third and fourth quarters of 2024, we continue to expect net interest margin expansion, driven by
fixed rate asset repricing and fourth quarter hedge maturities, as well as a full quarter impact of the securities
repositioning, which was completed in May. Kevin will provide further detail on our guidance momentarily, which is
based on an FOMC rate cut of 25 basis points in December.
Slide 7 shows total reported noninterest revenue was impacted by the $257 million of securities loss related to our
securities repositioning in the second quarter. However, adjusted noninterest revenue was $127 million, which is
a 9% jump from the previous quarter. Adjusted noninterest revenue was up $17 million or 15% year-over-year.
The majority of the sequential growth was attributable to higher capital markets fees, which surged 128% from the
first quarter and are expected to remain elevated in the second half of the year. The growth was driven by
syndication finance arranger fees and that capital markets income.

Also, commercial analysis, treasury and payment solutions fees increased 4%, while core wealth management
income increased 2%, outside of an expected decline in repo income due to client asset allocation changes.
When looking at the year-ago quarter, core banking fees increased 4%, supported by growth in treasury and
payment solutions, while capital markets fees increased 59% and commercial sponsorship income jumped 188%.
We continue to invest in core noninterest revenue streams that deepen client relationships and provide further
healthy fee growth in areas such as treasury and payment solutions, capital markets and wealth management.
Moving to expense, slide 8 highlights our operating cost discipline. Reported and adjusted noninterest expense
were both $302 million. Adjusted noninterest expense declined 5% from the first quarter and was flat compared to
the year-ago quarter. Employment expense fell 4% from the first quarter, largely due to seasonality, partially offset
by a full quarter impact of the 2024 merit increases and higher employee incentives.
Turning to other expenses, FDIC premiums declined as a result of the $13 million FDIC Special Assessment that
was accrued in the first quarter and a partial special assessment reversal of $4 million in the second quarter.
Legal expenses increased from the prior quarter, primarily due to expenses associated with previously resolved
problem loans. Employment expense declined 1% year-over-year, benefited by our 7% year-over-year decline in
head count. Occupancy and equipment expense increased 8%, as a result of ongoing technology investments, as
well as increased property expense. Importantly, we will remain proactive with disciplined expense management
in this growth-constrained environment.
Moving to slides 9 and 10 on credit quality. Provision for credit losses declined 51% from the first quarter to $26
million. Our allowance for credit losses ended the second quarter at $538 million or 1.25%, which is relatively
unchanged from the first quarter. Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $34 million or 32 basis points
compared to 41 basis points in the first quarter and 38 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Nonperforming loans declined 27% and are now 0.59% of loans, down from 0.81% in the first quarter, primarily
from the resolution of a previously charged off credit and slower inflows. The criticized and classified credit ratio
declined slightly to 3.7% and remains at very manageable levels. We have a high degree of confidence in the
strength and quality of our loan portfolio, and we will continue to reduce our non-relationship credits and manage
the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain macroeconomic environment.
As seen on slide 11, our capital position continued to build in the second quarter, with the preliminary common
equity Tier 1 ratio reaching 10.62% and total risk-based capital now at 13.59%. A strong quarter of core earnings,
coupled with the completion of our previously announced risk-weighted asset optimization exercise, helped to
support over 80 basis points of capital accretion within the quarter.
Against that, we completed the anticipated available for sale securities repositioning, and we executed
approximately $91 million in share repurchases. These actions served to diligently deploy our capital while still
ending the quarter near the top-end of our targeted CET1 range. More details on the securities repositioning can
be found in the appendix of our presentation deck.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we will maintain a disciplined approach to capital management, which
balances the uncertain economic environment with prudently managing near the top-end of our 10% to 10.5%
CET1 range. As a reminder, our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our balance sheet and capital
position for core client growth. However, we expect to complement that with share repurchases to effectively
manage within our capital management framework.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our 2024 guidance.

Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'll continue with our updated guidance for the remainder of 2024. Based on the first half results
and our existing pipelines, period-end loan growth is expected to be 0% to 2% in 2024. Growth should be
supported by continued success in middle market, corporate and investment banking, and specialty lines. Year-
to-date headwinds with senior housing and national account syndicated lending are expected to subside, but
broader commercial real estate payoff activity should increase in the second half of the year.
Our forecast for core deposits now supports growth within the 2% to 4% range, aided by seasonal tailwinds as the
year progresses and new core funding growth initiatives. Stable deposit costs should result in a peak total deposit
cost beta for this cycle near current levels of approximately 49%. Our outlook now points to adjusted revenue
growth in the negative 3% to 0% range. Importantly, our adjusted revenue guidance now assumes there is one 25
basis point rate cut in December 2024 compared to our prior assumption of stable rates, as well as the realization
of our robust capital markets pipeline in the second half of 2024.
We expect more net interest income improvement in the second half of this year, as deposit cost stability
combined with fixed rate asset repricing, our hedge maturities and the full impact of the securities repositioning
benefit our net interest margin. Adjusted noninterest revenue is now forecasted to grow in the mid single-digit
percentage range this year versus our previous guidance of low to mid single-digit growth. The previously
mentioned capital markets fee pipeline remains strong. We continue to execute on core growth in treasury and
payment solutions and the GreenSky forward flow program continues to build commercial sponsorship fees.
We remain very focused on disciplined expense control. Excluding the FDIC Special Assessments, we anticipate
our adjusted noninterest expense will be up 1% to 3% this year. This modest increase in expense guidance is due
to incremental expenses in infrastructure spend and investments, legal costs primarily associated with resolved
credits, and higher team member incentives. We continue to closely monitor and manage our loan portfolio for
any credit deterioration or systemic themes across industry and markets.
Given current credit migration trends, assuming a relatively stable economic environment and considering the
impact of certain large individual losses in late 2023 and early 2024, we expect net charge-offs to be flat to down
in the second half of this year, compared to 36 basis points in the first half of 2024. Moving to the tax rate, our
current forecast points to an approximately 21% level as compared to 21% to 22% previously.
Finally, our common equity Tier 1 ratio is above our targeted range of 10% to 10.5%. Therefore, we will remain
opportunistic with share repurchases to manage overall capital levels at or near the top-end of this range. Prudent
capital management remains our top priority to ensure we have a strong and liquid balance sheet, which is
prioritized toward serving the growth needs of our clients, regardless of the economic environment.
And now, operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the call for questions.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Maybe I guess just around the comments on net interest margin expansion in the back half, if you could unpack
that in terms of the drivers of margin expansion. Obviously, the full quarter impact of the bond book restructuring
should help. But beyond that, just remind us in terms of the back book repricing and how NII evolves in the face of
potential for rate cuts starting in September. Maybe if you could start there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ebrahim. When you look at the margin and the trajectory in the second half of the year, there are a few
different moving parts. First, as you mentioned, the securities repositioning. We experienced about half of that
benefit in the second quarter, and we'll experience another – the other half here in the third quarter. And so, that's
a tailwind to the margin this quarter. There is, as you know, a little bit of fixed rate asset repricing as well in the
third quarter that's a positive.
But then, there's a headwind due to average DDA balances. You can see that in the appendix. We put average
balances and end-of-period balances, and there will be a decline in average balances just given the second
quarter where that landed. And so, that'll be a headwind to the margin in the third quarter. But we expect margin
expansion in the third quarter, we expect margin expansion again in the fourth quarter, and we expect to end the
year at or approaching a 3.30% margin given a – with the assumption of a rate cut in December.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just incrementally, if we get a series of rate cuts, Jamie, is that a drag to the NIM, at least short-
term?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It does. It does. So, for our guidance, we used the Fed dot plot from June. But if you were to pivot to a September
rate cut, which is more consistent with the forward curve today, there would be pressure on the margin in the
month of September and October. And so, let me just kind of unpack that a little bit, because this is an important
question as we head into an easing cycle. In the period of time leading up to the ease, there is NIM pressure,
which is minor due to short rates declining in the expectation of an ease. And so, asset yields will decline, and
there's really not an offsetting benefit to funding cost.
Then, once the ease happens, the margin will be pressured further as the majority of floating rate loans reprice
down. Now, the full impact of the ease will flow through on the loans almost immediately, as the majority of our
floating rate loans are one month rates or shorter. But that will be partially mitigated by the 13% of floating rate
loans that are hedged. And then, when you're post easing, then you will start to see the benefit of reduced liability
cost.
And so, you have the asset repricing, but then the reduced deposit cost, reduced funding cost will come through,
and we believe that that will neutralize the reduction in asset yields over the course of one to two months. And so,
kind of to be more specific around that, if you were to just compare a September and December ease, the forward
curve, relative to the Fed dot plot, which is a December ease, there's about $5 million to $7 million margin – I
mean, a NII impact between those two scenarios, and it's split between the second and the third quarter – I mean,
the third and the fourth quarter because it's a September and October impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's extremely helpful. And just the only other follow-up, Jamie, you mentioned stable deposit costs second half.
One, if you don't mind, give us an update on the pricing sort of competition in your markets. We had a peer of
yours talk about intensity picking up, so would love any color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
The deposit pricing is playing out like we said in April. As we look at the outlook from here, we expect stable
deposit cost through the remainder of the year. We feel good about our positioning here. We feel good about our
production pipelines, pricing. What we've seen in the marketplace is not necessarily an increase in competition,
but we've seen more coalescing around rates and less volatility between highs and lows.
And it feels to us like on the promotional rate that there's a concentration around – if you look at CDs, the
concentration around 5%, and you're not seeing a lot of the outliers that we were seeing earlier in the year that
were much higher. And it appears that the banking industry, it appears everybody is preparing for an easing cycle
by shortening the duration, which is appropriate, and that's – you've seen that with us as well, where we have
two-thirds of our CDs that will mature in six months. And so, I feel like the industry is preparing for easing, the
industry is shortening the duration of time deposits and kind of coalescing around market rates. So, it feels
competitive but stable to us.

And, Ebrahim, just to put a data point behind Jamie's comments, our production rates for the quarter were 3.77%,
and we achieved kind of peak rates back in the fourth quarter of 2023 at 3.82%. So, we've seen stable production
yields quarter-on-quarter and actually a reduction versus where we ended last year.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start on the loan growth headwinds. Maybe could you help us better understand what's left in terms of
the remaining headwind from rationalization efforts? And then, Kevin, I thought you said that the CRE payoffs
would increase in the back half of the year. Maybe you could quantify that for us. And how far away do you think
we are to where these cumulative headwinds are really behind the company and that strategic growth and other
areas of growth we're seeing start becoming the total loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steven, it's a great question, because I think there – to your point, when you assess the growth of loan
outstandings, there's multiple components. And we've talked a lot about our ability to grow predicated on
increasing production. But as you mentioned, there's a couple of things that are driving outstandings lower in the
current environment. First and foremost, we've been rationalizing some of our portfolios that either we think have
lower returns or have a lower funding profile, and that specifically is senior housing, third-party consumer, our...

...national accounts. Thank you. And when you look at those portfolios, and we've run off about $2.3 billion in the
last 12 months in those portfolios, that's reduced their total percentage of outstandings from 18% to 13%, and
that's largely been accomplished. And so, as we look forward for senior housing, national accounts, those
balances will stay roughly flat. And when you look at third-party consumer, those are going to continue to decline
just because we're not putting on a lot of new production. So, I would say that the headwinds around
rationalization and any loan sales, which as you recall, we did the MOB sale, the medical office sale last year,
that's largely done.
So, as you look into the future, our production levels are actually increasing. When you look at this quarter alone,
we were at $1.3 billion in funded production. That was up 37% quarter-on-quarter and almost back to the levels
we saw back in 2023. So, production is picking up. Our pipelines are up 8% quarter-on-quarter.
So, then the other question mark is the payoff and paydown activity. This quarter, as Jamie referenced, the payoff
activity occurred more on the C&I side. It was the national accounts and senior housing, and we saw about $250
million of lower utilization on C&I.
From a CRE perspective, we don't expect the payoffs to really pick up this quarter, but rather in the fourth quarter.
And that's just based on some of the maturities that we have. And to put it in context, we had about $570 million
of payoff and paydown activity this quarter. That number could get as high as $800 million to $900 million. So,
we're talking about $400 million-ish increase in payoff activity, and those are the headwinds. Now, again, that's
predicated on some of the renewals. As we look into 2025, as we've shared in the past, we think a lot of those
headwinds are completely abated and we return to more of a normalized growth rate, pending what the
underlying economic environment looks like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's terrific color. Maybe just for my follow-up question – thank you for that. In terms of the noninterest-
bearing deposits, right, there was a bit of excitement last quarter when you guys talked about seeing a trough
maybe and stability in February, March, April, and then this quarter, the period-end noninterest-bearing came
down quite a bit again. Could you walk us through what you ended up seeing there, because it seems like they
trended a bit down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's – we had a good start to the quarter, and we saw some declines as the quarter progressed. And it was
really relegated to our commercial operating accounts. And when you look at the average balance there, we're
still running about 20% higher than what the average balances were prior to the pandemic. So, it still suggests
that there's some sort of excess cash sitting on our commercial client balance sheets and they're using it. As
maybe correlated to the reduction in utilization, we continue to see our commercial clients use cash.
As rates decline, as we achieve kind of pre-pandemic levels, which we're getting closer to that, we think that
diminishment will continue to decline, and ultimately, the production and some augmentation that we're starting to
see will offset that. So, still expect to see some DDA remixing in the second half of the year, but the pace at which
it's diminishing continues to decline.

And Steven, one thing I would add to that is, when you break it down, we have – to Kevin's point on commercial,
we've seen stability in retail DDA since the beginning of the year. Commercial, like the smaller commercial clients,
that is down, but it's only down slightly. And so, it's – I feel like the stability is increasing, but it's going upmarket as
we go through those. And so, that's what we're seeing, and we – one thing that helps us believe that it'll diminish
in the second half of the year as well.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Maybe just – quickly just following up on the margin discussion, and you mentioned that we have half the benefit
of the securities repositioning. What was the – what's the spot yield on the securities book at the end of the
quarter going into third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Jared, I don't have that handy. I think, we were at 3.04% for the quarter itself. It's about a 40 basis point impact
just due to the repositioning. But I don't have the spot yield at quarter-end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, okay. That's fine. And then, looking at credit, if you could give – just a little more discussion around that. It's
great seeing sort of the confidence there in the bigger trends. When you look at the driver of the lower ACL, is that
really loan-level performance that you're feeling more comfortable with or was there some change to the broader
macro model assumptions driving that? And then, should we assume that we're sort of stable here at these levels,
given the broader economic outlook?

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jared, this is Jamie again. And by the way, that was 3.32% in June for the securities yield. Look, the
allowance, when you look at that, the change quarter-on-quarter, it really was due to the macro drivers. You can
see the waterfall in the appendix of the change. Forward-looking, we feel good about the level where we are right
now. When you look at the components of the allowance quarter-on-quarter, the performance in CRE continues to
be very strong, and the allowance to loan ratio for the quarter, life-of-loan loss estimate was down in CRE and it
was up a little bit in C&I. So, you see a little bit of shifts within the portfolios. But all together, we would expect
stability from here, given the economic outlook, as we continue to look at how the portfolio migrates going into the
second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And I think, Jared, just to your broader question on credit, I think it was a solid quarter on all fronts. When you
look at the data, net charge-offs down 9 basis points, NPLs declined 22 basis points. Our FDMs declined $93
million, but we only had $62 million of NPL inflows, and to Jamie's point, only $1 million of that was in CRE. And
when you talk about the ACL, yeah, it came down a bit. But our coverage to NPLs increased back to 210%. So,
all-in-all, I think it was a storyline that was broad-based, and as we've been talking about, as we look at the data
and the underlying credit metrics, we're not seeing any additional deterioration. In many ways, we're starting to
see some improvement in some of the metrics. And so, as we look into the next couple of quarters, that's why we
feel very comfortable about guiding flat to down in overall charge-offs.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the expenses front, can you expand a little bit on the drivers of the higher
expense guide? And the number implies, I think, about $315 million or so of expenses a quarter in the back half.
So, how do you think about that as a jumping off point into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thanks for the question, Manan. I would just start and say the baseline for the second quarter, I would use $306
million, which is adjusted expenses excluding the FDIC reversal. And we are expecting the third quarter to be in
the $310 million area. So, not the $315 million you mentioned. We expect that to be driven by increased
personnel costs, and that's largely a day count issue. We do have some infrastructure project spend. Some of
that's fraud detection, fraud prevention, pricing analytics, and then there's just simply some other inflationary
impacts. And so, it's about a 1% increase from the second quarter getting to the $310 million area, and we expect
that to hold in the fourth quarter as well.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Got it. And that's a good run rate for 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look at 2025, we do think that expense rate will be a little more normalized. We will give an update on 2025
more at the end of the year. But we do expect expenses to be more normalized in 2025. And so, 2024 benefited
from a lot of the efforts that we did in 2023 with Synovus Forward. In the second half of the year in 2023, we had
a lot of efficiency efforts that were very successful in reducing cost, improving efficiency, reducing head count,
and those benefited this year.
I mean, when you think about the full year 2024, we're talking about up 2% if you do use the midpoint of the
guide, excluding FDIC, and there are some large drivers in there of expense increases. We have about a 1%
impact of – simply of merit. About a 1% impact of the consolidation of Qualpay. About a 1% impact of credit-
related expenses from the first half of the year. And with all of that and every other inflationary impact, we're still
guiding to a 2% – 1% to 3% number. That feels pretty good. But we do expect 2025 to likely be higher than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. I appreciate the color. And then, maybe separately on capital, your target CET1 is 10% to 10.5%. You're
slightly above that. I think you're saying you want to manage to the higher end. What keeps you at the higher end
of that 10% to 10.5% target? Is it the current uncertainty in the economy? Is it credit? What would drive you to
move to the lower end or even below that that 10% number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
In isolation, we would drive to be there today. Just when you look at capital management, stress testing, scenario
analysis, there's nothing quantitative that would drive you to the levels where we are now or even to 10% to
10.5%. You would actually likely run below that when we think about capital deterioration and severe adverse
scenario. But we believe it's prudent to operate with higher capital than the models would suggest, just given, one,
there is uncertainty in the environment, but again that would point you to the levels where we are today; and two,
where peers are. And so, one thing we've seen over the past few years in economic uncertainty, in market
uncertainty, we do believe that relative capital ratios to peers in uncertain times can lead to higher betas, and we
think it's prudent to stay closer to peer levels. And so, while it's not quantitative, it's not due to uncertainty in the
income statement, it's not due to uncertainty in the balance sheet, we do think it's prudent to run at these higher
levels in the current environment.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So – good morning. So, capital markets was pretty strong in the quarter. And Jamie, you mentioned how you
expect it to stay elevated going forward, I guess, for the rest of the year. So, does that mean we'll still see, I
guess, close to that $15 million run rate back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We do expect to see that continue. However, I would just qualify it with it is uncertain how it'll play out quarter to
quarter. So, I feel more confident in the total number in the second half of the year than being able to say it's a
stable number quarter to quarter. Because with our client base, with the uncertainty with the economy, with the
uncertainty with the election, we do believe that it's likely that there are deals that'll wait until the fourth quarter.
And so, that could backend-load the capital markets fee revenue. So, again, we feel good about the total number,
just not certain how much will come through in Q3 and how much will come through in Q4.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brandon, to add to the reason we feel comfortable with that, as Jamie mentioned, we've been investing in
some of the capital market solutions for some time. And if I look back several years, I would say 80% of our
revenue in capital markets came from the derivative side. If I look at this quarter as a standalone basis, only 25%
of the revenue came from derivatives, almost 30% came from syndications and lead arranger fees. We had
almost a quarter of the revenue from DCM fees. A little over 10% in FX, 10% in SBA. So, it is so broad-based that
it gives us the opportunity that we're not over-reliant on one particular area, and that's what gives us confidence
that we'll be able to continue with this new kind of high water run rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And that was actually my follow-up question is if you thought this was kind of a base to grow off of in 2025
and beyond.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think – and think about this, when we start to see loan production pick up again, the derivative income will
pick up with it. So, I think there's not only a run rate here, but there's a lot of growth that could come off this base.

Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, your expectations around deposit – brokered deposit runoff, you had a
decline in the quarter. Just how are you expecting that to trend in the back half of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look at the back half of the year, we would expect to see that stable to declining. We saw some decent
declines in the first half of the year. But I think we'll look to see how loan growth progresses in the second half of
the year to really see how brokered deposits will play out. But we probably would say it's stable to down.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess I was a little bit surprised that the revenue guide – the top-end of the revenue guide was maybe guided
down a little bit following the strong NII quarter and the momentum you're seeing on the fee side. I guess maybe
just talk us through some of the dynamics that could still net us to the kind of low-end, that negative 3%, or maybe
you have greater confidence, given some of the results and expectations for the second half of the year that
revenue is going to be more or less flat for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we look at the second half of the year, the upside drivers to our guidance would be largely loan growth. And
so, you think about – we took 1% off the top on loan growth, and that helped lead to the reduction of the top-end
on revenue growth. But when we look at the rest of the year, high-end of our revenue guide would be, one, it
16


Synovus Financial Corp.
(SNV) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
could be a flat rate scenario which would be accretive. Two, it would be continued strength in fee revenue that
outpaces the mid single-digits that – where we've given guidance, which is a possibility. Three, it would be
increased loan growth. As Kevin mentioned, that – the assumptions in our guide include declines in CRE, and that
is not something that we've seen year-to-date. It's not something that we expect to see necessarily in the third
quarter. And so, that could be a tailwind as well.
And so, I guess I would point to loan balances being one of the bigger drivers to the high-end of the range in NII
for the second half of the year. If you think about the lower end of the range, I would say it would be in fee
revenue. It could be deals getting pushed out and pushed into 2025, even though we don't expect that in fee
revenue. But it would also be if there's more aggressive easing than what we have in there, which is the
December ease. But as I mentioned earlier, we think that if you just add a September ease, that's only a $5
million to $7 million impact to NII in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And as a follow-up, maybe can you just talk us through the strategy of reclassifying your available for
sale bonds into held to maturity during the quarter, especially it being longer duration bonds that were moved to
HTM, kind of locking in that AOCI? Can you just maybe talk through the rationale and that change at this point in
the rate cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, understood. The rationale was, first, these are securities that were unlikely to ever be sold, because they're
longer duration, they were deeper underwater. And so, the marks were large enough that it was unlikely there
would be a scenario where we would ever sell these securities. Second, as – we do not look at tangible common
equity ratios as far as a risk management tool. We use regulatory capital ratios, we use NII volatility, things like
that, that kind of get to what people use tangible common equity for the ratio – the AOCI impact of that.
But we have seen the press and the Street use tangible common equity volatility and AOCI frequently when
they're comparing banks. And we thought it was prudent to take a little bit of that volatility off the table. When we
moved them to held to maturity, there was approximately $700 million in unrealized losses associated with that
portion of the securities portfolio, and moving that to held to maturity reduced tangible common equity volatility of
a 100-basis-point rate move down from 75 basis points to around 50 basis points.
And so, we just think it's prudent to reduce the volatility in that ratio. Same thing can be said for CET1 including
AOCI, even though we're not held to that standard. And so, that was the general thought that there was very little
opportunity calls. These were not securities that we were likely to ever trade, and it would just reduce the volatility
in TCE as well as CET1 including AOCI.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow back up on the fee income discussion. And could you just kind of
help us just broadly, not just capital markets, but broadly think about maybe the run rate that you're expecting in
fees in the back half of the year? If we're kind of – if we're trying to look around your mid single-digit growth range,
then it would imply that your kind of core fee run rate is going back to around the first quarter level, which is a big
pull-back from what we saw this past quarter. And so, just trying to think about, are you being conservative there
or is there actually a case to be made that we could see closer to high single-digit growth here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Catherine, as we look at fee revenue growth with the mid-single-digit range, you're right, is a little bit higher
than in the first quarter. But we expect the third quarter – again, the timing of the capital markets piece is the
uncertainty. But in the second half of the year, we would expect to see similar fee revenue as what you've kind of
seen – at or close to what you saw in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, that is a significant – that does make the case that fee income growth will be much higher than your
guidance, which is great. Okay. And then, as you think about next year, what kind of longer-term growth rate in
fees would you expect, just given some of the momentum you're seeing in capital markets?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
I mean, I think it kind of gets back to what we were saying earlier. We're obviously not giving 2025 guidance. But
what we've been trying to build is a foundation around some of these core fee income revenue sources that will
generate sustainable growth. And to your point, when you look at fee income this past quarter, it was up 15%
year-over-year, and that was a function of many different areas, not just capital markets, although capital markets
had a strong growth. We were up in core fees about 4%, and that's largely a function of our treasury and payment
solutions area. We've been growing at about 14% year-over-year in annualized fee income. We've also had
growth in some our other fee categories like credit cards and other fee income.
Remind you there was a big headwind going into this year in wealth management. We had both repo revenue
down, and that was a product that we were selling to a large municipality that no longer was using that solution,
and that was providing just a $4 million – it's a total of $4 million headwind for the quarter. And we divested of our
money management firm GLOBALT, and that was about $2.3 million.
So, when you think about our results today, you add in those headwinds along with a change in our underlying
consumer account structure that minimizes insufficient funds, which also has a headwind. When you look out to
2025, you're not going to have those. You're not going to have a headwind with NSF fees. You're not going to
have repo headwinds. GLOBALT will be fully off the books, and there'll be no comparability. So, when we
continue to have the performance in core banking fees, capital markets, and we get some of the growth in wealth
again, I think you could see a growth rate that is even higher than this year depending on the underlying
economic environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's super helpful. And one more follow-up, just the other line that's been about $18 million the past
couple of quarters, is there anything kind of one-time that you see in that, or do you think that's also a good run
rate for the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
There were some one-time benefits from some OREO properties, where we took some fee income from that. So,
that was elevated a little bit this past quarter. So, I think other will come down a little bit and may be made up in
some other categories.

All right, perfect. Catherine actually just asked my question. But just maybe one on the – I know it's minor, but you
did have an inflection in criticized and classified. Can you just talk about broadly what that's composed of by
category and if you're starting to see migration maybe more into C&I-type credits, where I think we're seeing an
increased number of bankruptcies versus some of the earlier migration in, I assume office, and I know you talked
about transportation in the past, things like that. Are you seeing a broadening or shifting of any sort of migration
there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Michael. It's Bob. Just a couple of comments on that. But the inflection was really on our past due
ratio. We had a past due credit that settled and resolved and came off the list the first week of July. So, that
cleared. So, that's the bulk of a spike in past dues. In terms of criticized and classified, we were relatively stable
overall around 3.7%. So, again, that's a little bit of a moving target as you think about loans moving in and out of
your watch list and in and out of criticized category. So, there can be some volatility in that. But the general
thought from our perspective is that the portfolio is accurately rated. The migration that was negative is still –
maybe perhaps slightly negative bias. But I would say it's showing signs of stability. That gives us a lot of comfort
in terms of our guidance.
And then, to your point, as it relates to C&I and CRE, there's no question that that we've seen the – the C&I stress
come through, again, within our expectations. But the C&I stress come through, which is a function, quite frankly,
of just rates being this high for longer and the general inflation pressures on some of these leveraged corporate
credits. From our perspective, the good news is that that list of challenges continues to get smaller. And you
couple that with – to your point around CRE, we haven't seen the defaults there. We certainly have had one or
two here or there, and we expect that over time, but quite frankly, to-date, held up fairly well, to Kevin's point
earlier.
And then finally, our senior housing portfolio, which gave us some dings and scratches earlier on, those macro
figures in that industry continue to improve. Occupancy's better, rents are better, labor costs have stabilized to
some degree as well. So, we kind of do all that calculus and we come up and feel pretty good about where we are
and feel pretty confident in guiding to flat to slightly down in charge-offs and feel pretty good about the position of
the portfolio. The risk is the unknowns in C&I and if we stay – rates stay higher for longer, but it looks like that risk
potentially may be beginning to come off the table as well. So, we're getting a little more optimistic.

That's great color, Bob. And maybe just to follow up on it, your last point kind of leads into it is if we do get a
couple rate cuts, I would assume that – probably too early to call kind of a peak in criticized, classified, NPAs,
things like that. But you could definitely make the case, I would think, right, that we would have peaked with a few
rate cuts, barring the economy not getting really any worse? Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's generally fair, Michael. I would – a little bit of caution there would be, while criticized/classified,
that's $1.5 billion, right, so it takes a fair amount to kind of move that number. You get into NPLs, and we're sitting
at 59 basis points today, there's some chunky credits in there. So, you could have a quarter where it moves up or
moves down. Obviously, last quarter, we had a big NPL that we spoke about on this call. So, we're back down to
levels that we feel pretty good about. And we, quite frankly, look ahead and don't see those chunks, as I
mentioned, being quite as big. So, that gives us some comfort. But you could still have some movement there.
But the general trend line, we think, particularly to your point, as rates come down, should be positive for us.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks very much. Bob, just to continue your answer from the last question, do you see restructurings in CRE as
possible solutions or is it a little early for those? I'm just curious about our ways to see further progress on the
criticized number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I do. I mean, we certainly – as we've said before, I
mean, our intention is to work with our clients on coming up with solutions. If it needs to be restructured, then we
certainly want to work towards a mutually agreeable structure. So, I think that's, in a broad sense, certainly one of
the tools in the toolbox. We will do that. We've done that. It's not a extend-and-pretend or whatever the common
phrases you hear are. From our perspective, it's let's come up with the right solution.
I think it's a little early, to your point, probably to make any kind of prediction on that specifically as it relates to
office. We have – Chris, we have one office loan on non-accrual today. So, I mean, that – we've got a few that are

challenged and that are rated certainly, and one or two that we're working through modifications on. And again,
that'll give us some chunkiness in our FDM categories, et cetera. But for the most part, I think you're dealing with
a handful of credits, and we feel good about being able to work through them. But I do think it's a little early to say
that's a play that equals a certain amount of dollars for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then, the charge-off guidance has been very consistent for quite a while. I'm
just curious if you see any risk to that as we head into the next few quarters, next year, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
You know, Chris, we spent a lot of time forecasting. I feel good about our forecast. I think we're not – there's a lot
of calculus that goes into being comfortable to tell you that we think charge-offs will be flat to slightly down. So, we
feel good about that. And again, the reasons why, as we spoke about before, the list of corporate credits
continues to get smaller, senior housing continues to improve, although we've still got one or two we're working
through. But the macros are good there.
And commercial real estate, to your earlier point, continues to hold up well and probably comes out over longer
periods of time. And you do all that math, add it all up, that kind of equals where we think we'll be and why we're
comfortable with that type of guidance. The risk to that is you don't know what you don't know. And if rates stay up
longer in – particularly in C&I, you could continue to see some pockets of stress. But I think they're isolated. I
don't think they're in any particular industry. Just the general stress of higher rates being higher for longer could –
certainly could give you a surprise or two. But we feel pretty good about where we are right now.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, perfect. Awesome. I'm sorry. I'm not sure what happened there. So, I just wanted to circle back on the fee
income and go specifically to Maast. It's been a long road for the project, and I wanted to get an update from you
just about the strategic direction. Should we be thinking about Maast as a revenue – sort of meaningful revenue
driver or has it become a client acquisition tool and that's how we should frame that for the story moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Samuel, I think it's still a meaningful revenue opportunity. What we've done over the last really six months
is we've taken a step back. We had users on the platform. We had a very active pipeline. And what we tried to
evaluate is, are our products that we're offering through the solution at the class that will allow us to continue to
expand and have a scalable product. And so, we kind of took a step back and we're rebuilding some of the
underlying functionality and capabilities within Maast.

We also are positioning it not as to many – as many clients and prospects. So, we had 46 names in the pipeline.
We're going to try to onboard far fewer and focus on larger clients and not just focus on the ISV segment, but also
the ISO segment. And so, you'll hear more in the coming quarters as we relaunch the product with maybe a more
surgical view of who the target audience is. But we still think it's going to be a viable solution that will not only
allow us to generate fee income, but will also generate core deposits. So, we'll talk more about it. But we're back
kind of in the basement, working on the products and solutions, and we'll be back out in the market later this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And let me jump back in on the fee revenue. And Catherine, you asked the question about the run rate for the
second half of the year, and I said flat to the second quarter. I meant – I mean, flat to the second quarter. It's flat
to the first half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank for that. And then, just a quick follow-up around capital. I guess you've mentioned that obviously
buybacks are firmly on the table, as they were this past quarter. Could you just share your thought process
around the trade-off between doing more buybacks versus perhaps another smaller restructure on the bond
portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, when you look at further restructurings of the bond portfolio, the payback just gets longer and longer. We did
– the first one we did was about a three-year payback, and the second one was about a five-year payback. And
it's just not that attractive to us at that duration when you get beyond there. The one we just did was attractive just
because of the capital generated from the risk-weighted asset optimization efforts.
And so, it's unlikely that we will do another repositioning of the securities portfolio. And we're very comfortable
with capital ratios where they are. They're near our target of the high-end of the range of 10% to 10.5%. But you
should expect to see us continue doing what we've done in the past, which is prioritize client growth, be ready for
client growth when it comes, and grow the balance sheet. And if we're sitting here with excess capital, you should
see us use share repurchases to balance it out.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
During the second quarter, we did continue to receive national recognition for our work environment and service
excellence. We earned a Great Place to Work certification for the fourth year in a row. Our Family Office won two
awards from the Family Wealth Report. Our customer care center and team members were awarded several Best
of the Best Awards by Customer Contact Week. I am proud of our teams and the recognition of their efforts and
the impact it has on delivering on our purpose to help people achieve their full potential.
As we look forward in 2024 and we approach 2025, I am confident that we will sustain our momentum and see
key improvement in our financial performance. This confidence is driven by the following facts. Our net interest
margin and our net interest income troughed in the first quarter, with deposit prices peaking and future NIM
expansion fully supported by our actions. Our credit cost and our credit outlook have improved. Our fee income
has hit a new high watermark due to the broad-based success and execution. Expenses have been well-
contained with flat year-over-year growth, and with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 53% this quarter, we continue to
outperform our peers.
In addition, our efforts to optimize the balance sheet to better position us for growth are largely complete. The
benefits derived from risk-weighted optimization efforts allowed us in the second quarter to restructure the bond
portfolio, which increased yields by roughly 50 basis points. Our loan portfolio optimization efforts around third-
party, medical office, national syndications and senior housing have resulted in a reduction of $2.3 billion in
outstandings over the last 12 months, reducing the percentage of loans in these categories from 18% to 13%. Our
capital levels are eight-year highs, and these strong levels provide for additional flexibility and fuel for future
growth.
And lastly, we remain well-situated in a great footprint. Whatever the economic forecast is for the foreseeable
future, we have the opportunity for relative outperformance. Look no further than the recently released Atlanta
Fed research titled, Poised for More Growth, the Southeastern Economy is Outperforming the US. So, yes, I'm
optimistic about our future and our ability to drive meaningful and sustainable growth and improved profitability.
And I look forward to future earnings calls to provide updates on our progress. In the meantime, we look forward
to seeing many of our investors in upcoming meetings and scheduled conferences.
So, for now, Esra, that concludes our second quarter 2024 earnings call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much, everyone, for joining. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect
your lines.
