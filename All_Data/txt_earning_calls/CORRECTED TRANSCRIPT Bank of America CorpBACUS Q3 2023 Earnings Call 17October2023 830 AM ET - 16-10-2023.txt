Good morning. Thank you. Welcome and thank you for joining the call to review the third quarter results. As
usual, our earnings release documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com
website, and it includes the earnings presentation that we will be referring to during the call. I trust everybody has
had a chance to review the documents. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some
opening comments before Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, discusses the details of the quarter. Before we do that, let
me just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to some non-GAAP financial
measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to materially
differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials as well as the SEC filings available on our website.
Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our
earnings materials that are on the website.
So, with that, Brian, I'd turn the call over to you.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, we're starting on slide 2. Our third quarter here
at Bank of America was another strong quarter as we delivered $7.8 billion in net income. That is a 10% growth
over the year ago third quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, we have earned $23.4 billion, an
increase of 15% over 2022. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace across all our
businesses. Our operating leverage was about flat. We improved our common equity tier 1 ratio by nearly 30
basis points in the quarter to a level of 11.9% against a current minimum of 9.5%. We saw an increase in our
deposits and we maintained our strong pricing discipline. We continued to maintain $859 billion in Global Liquidity
Sources. We also delivered a good return for you, our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of
over 15% and a 1% return on assets.
Just a quick note of what we see in the economy. Our team of economists predicts a soft landing with a trough in
the middle of next year. We see that in our customer data, our 37 million checking customers, we see their
spending slowing down. You can see that on slide 34. The third quarter was up about 4% over last year's third
quarter. Earlier this year, that would have been more of a 10% increase year-over-year; and for the entire year
2022, it increased 10% round numbers over 2021. This 4% level is consistent with the spending we saw in the
pre-pandemic period from 2016 to 2019. That is consistent with the low inflation, lower growth economy. As we
3

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
move into October, the spending is holding at that 4% level. So growing, but growing at a base that's more
consistent with low growth, low inflation economy.
With that, let me turn to slide 3. We provide various highlights and Alastair is going to cover a lot of this. Our team
continues to focus on driving organic growth, driving digital progress and operational excellence, which keeps us
focused on operating leverage. A few words on organic growth as we flip to slide 4. Every business segment had
organic growth. In Consumer, in quarter three, we opened more than 200,000 net new checking accounts this
quarter alone. We also opened another 1 million credit card accounts. We have 10% more investment accounts
this year third quarter than we did last year. In Small Business, we have seen 35 straight quarters of net new
checking account growth. We've also seen good Small Business loan growth and our loans are up 14% from last
year. That was in this quarter, our Small Business teammates extended $2.8 billion in credit to Small Business in
America alone.
In Global Wealth, we added nearly 7,000 net new relationships to the Merrill and Private Banking franchises and
our advisors opened more than 35,000 new bank accounts for the third consecutive quarter, fulfilling both
investing and banking needs for those clients. We also increased our number of advisors. In the past year, across
our wealth spectrum, in GWIM and in consumer investments, they have combined together $87 billion in total net
flows. In our Global Banking team, we added clients and increased the number of products per relationship. Year-
to-date, we've added 1,900 new Commercial and Business Banking clients. That is more than we added in the full
year last year. Even while activity is low, the investment banking team continues to hold its number three position.
In the Global Markets, we continue to see performance establish new records for our firm. I'm going to cover that
in a little more detail in a moment.
As you can move to slide 5, you can see the digital adoption and engagement volumes continue to increase. We
lead the industry in digital banking and continue to provide the best-in-class disclosures. You can find those
disclosures by line of business in the appendix on slides 26, 29 and 31. We also continue to receive top
accolades from third-parties around these capabilities. Most important, these capabilities are valued by our clients
and customers and allow us to grow with great expense leverage. Let me give you a few examples. Our
Consumer and Merrill clients logged into our Consumer Banking app a record 3.2 billion times this quarter. Even
at this scale and stage of maturity of this operation, logins are up double-digits from the year prior. Customer use
of Erica continue to beat our expectations with almost 19 million users, up 16% in the past 12 months.
CashPro app sign-ins with our business clients are up more than 40% and we recently added the Erica
functionality to CashPro to help corporate clients benefit from that artificial intelligence. Likewise, Zelle usage
continues to grow. Zelle transaction levels are up more than 25% from last year and Zelle is becoming a
meaningful way our customers move money. In fact, customers now send money with Zelle at twice the rate they
write checks. We're nearing a period where the Zelle transactions sent will exceed the combination of checks
written and ATM withdrawal transactions. As you move across the lines of business on the slide, the story is the
same. All these capabilities help us deliver faster, safer and more efficiently, and all of it gets strong customer
client feedback. When you put that together, that helps us drive operating leverage, and you can see it on slide 6.
We have a strong record of driving operating leverage in our company.
We drove operating leverage every quarter for nearly five years before the pandemic. And again more recently,
we've had an eight quarter streak leading into this quarter. We acknowledged to you this last quarter that
operating leverage is going to be tough for a few quarters as we navigate through the trough of net interest
income. But as you can see on slide 6, we managed to grow our revenue year-over-year faster than expense in
dollar terms this quarter even though the percentage change was basically flat. Now, in January, we told you we'd
manage our head count down to help make sure we got our expenses in line. Over the course of 2023, we've
4

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
seen moving from 2022's Great Resignation to a current level of a record low attrition in our company. All that
meant the team had to work harder to manage that head count down. And they did it. Our head count is now
down over 7,000 FTEs from a peak in January even with the addition of 2,500 college grads this fall.
As a result, you've seen expense decline from $16.2 billion in quarter one to $16 billion in quarter two to $15.8
billion this quarter. And by the way, we've done this without special charges or large layoffs. [indiscernible]
(00:08:28) in the fourth quarter, excluding any FDIC special assessment, of course, we expect to report $15.6
billion in expenses in 4Q. Now interestingly, the debt is up only around 1% from fourth quarter of last year. This is
stronger expense guidance than we thought we could do earlier in the year and sets us up nicely for next year.
Shifting gears, let's focus on the balance sheet. Slide 7 shows the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending
basis across the third quarter. We gave you this chart last quarter also. In the upper left hand, you can see the
trend of total deposits. We ended quarter three at $1.88 trillion, up from quarter two and better than industry
results. What you should also note is the cost of these deposits.
Our team has rewarded customers with higher rates for their investment [ph] -oriented (00:09:16) cash, reinitiated
deposit growth and grown share, all with superior mix and cost. You will note that we're now paying 155 basis
points all-in for deposits, which is up 31 basis points from last quarter. Best that you remember two things when
you think about the deposits. The rate remains low relative to many because of the transactional nature of our
deposit relationships with $565 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits. And you can see in the upper right alone,
the low interest and no interest checking, there's $504 billion in Consumer. Secondly, remember the importance
of spread against the quarter's average Fed funds rate. This position is very advantaged compared to past cycles
because the transactional accounts in the current cycle are a much higher mix of Bank of America's deposits.
I would also add that while we've maintained discipline in deposit pricing, we've paid competitive rates to
customers with excess cash seeing higher yields across all the businesses. If rates fall, those particular products
would see the rates come down also. Dropping into the business trends, in Consumer, if you look at the top right
chart, you saw a $22 billion decline. Note the difference in the movement through the quarter between the
balance of low to no interest checking accounts and higher yielding non-checking accounts. You could also see
the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balance in consumer investments and CD balances broken out. In total,
we have $982 billion in consumer deposits. In Consumer alone, this is $250 billion more than we had pre-
pandemic. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 34 basis points. This remains very low,
driven by the high percentage of high-quality transactional accounts.
Most of the quarter's rate increase is concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits, which are about
13% of the deposits. Turning to Wealth Management, balances were flat. We saw a slowing in the previous
quarterly trend of clients moving money from lower yielding sweep accounts into higher yielding preferred
deposits and off-balance sheet products. Sweep balances were down by $7 billion and replaced by new account
generation [ph] deepening (00:11:20). At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposits grew $2 billion and
have hovered around $500 billion the past six quarters. These are generally the transactional deposits of our
commercial customers used to manage their cash flows. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 37% of deposits at
the end of the quarter. Sticking with the balance sheet, but moving to capital, let me give you a few thoughts on
the proposed capital rules.
As you are well aware, our banking industry in the United States is the most highly capitalized and most profitable
banking group in the world. It's a source of strength for our country and its economy. The annual stress test now
over dozen years old using ever-increasingly harsher test scenarios have proven that capital is sufficient. Banks
have proven to be a part of the solution during the more recent COVID pandemic and the banking disruption in
March this year. If we add to our capital, it will reduce our lending capacity to American business consumers, and
5

those trade-offs are being debated. But as far as the rules are concerned, there are many parts of the rules that
our industry doesn't agree with because of double counts or increased trading and market risk. And we're talking
through those proposals and working and we're hopeful they'll change. But in any event, they may not. And if they
don't, how will they affect us?
If you go to slide 8, you can show the expected impact as we interpret those proposed rules. This assumes that
they're proposed today without any changes. The proposed rules would inflate our risk-weighted assets by about
20%. So if I apply the inflation against this quarter's RWA of $1.63 trillion, that means if nothing else change in the
rules, we'd end up with about $320 billion more risk-weighted assets. The biggest increase in RWA would be a
couple hundred billion dollars in operational RWA. The next biggest category would be driven by a fourfold
increase in the RWA against non-publicly-traded equity exposures. In our case, that really is mostly about the tax-
advantaged investments in solar and wind. Looking at the capital to be held against the inflated RWA on the right
side of the slide, I'd remind you today that our minimum capital requirement is to hold 9.5% in common equity tier
1.
But based on our G-SIB charges that are going to come into effect on January 1, 2024, we move to 10%, so I'm
going to use that as the requirement. Holding 10% today means $163 billion. We finished the third quarter with
$194 billion. So today we have more than $30 billion excess capital. Now let's assume the proposed changes
going through in full. Those proposed changes are phased in from the middle of 2025 to 2028 under the current
proposal. When those are fully phased in, as we used to call Basel fully phased in if you remember, we would
have a need for $195 billion of total capital. Now, if you look on the upper right hand side of the page, you'll see
that today we're at $194 billion. So we hold the required capital today and, of course, we'd have to build a buffer
to that throughout the implementation period.
But if you look at the bottom of the page, you can see just in the last nine quarters the kind of capital generation
this company has. Once we understand the final rules, we'll of course have a chance to optimize our balance
sheet and appropriately price assets to improve the return on tangible common equity. Now before I turn it over to
Alastair, I just want to highlight one of the businesses that we've talked about over the many years; that's our
Global Markets business. Global Markets represents 17% of the company's year-to-date earnings and is one of
the top capital markets platforms in the world. It's one of a handful of firms [ph] that can do when it's due
(00:14:51) providing advice and execution in every major market around the world.
Jim DeMare and the team who run the business asked us for an additional investment around four years ago, and
they've grown this business with an intensity that clients have appreciated and rewarded us with more of their
business. This has produced strong revenue growth. We've grown the balance sheet here but have done it
efficiently. That's allowed us to grow sales and trading revenue over the past 12 months consistently and now
stands 32% higher than the average of the five years leading into the pandemic and the investment in the
business. And through effective cost management, we also generated 11% to 12% returns on capital in this
business. This exceeds our cost of capital even as we continue to allocate more capital to the business.
Returns are even larger if you combine it with the Global Banking business, that many show the businesses
combined, because our corporate clients also take advantage of these industry-leading business capabilities.
With that, let me turn over the call to Alastair to walk through the quarter. Alastair?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
Thanks, Brian. And on slide 10, we present the summary income statement. I'm not going to spend a lot of time
here because Brian touched on this and the highlights that we show on slide 3. For the quarter, we generated
$7.8 billion in net income, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share. Both of those are up double digits from the third
quarter of last year. The year-over-year revenue growth of 3% was led by improvement in net interest income
coupled with a strong 8% increase in sales and trading results, and that excludes DVA, and a 4% increase in
investment and brokerage revenue driven by our Wealth Management businesses. Expense for the quarter of
$15.8 billion included good discipline from our team which allowed us to reduce costs from the second quarter
even as we continue our planned investments for marketing, technology, and physical presence buildouts
including financial center openings and renovations.
Asset quality remains stellar and provision expense for the quarter was $1.2 billion that consisted of $931 million
of net charge-offs and $303 million of reserve build. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-
offs toward pre-pandemic levels and remains below historical levels. Our charge-off rate was 35 basis points;
that's 2 basis points higher than the second quarter and still below the 39 basis points we saw in the fourth
quarter of 2019. And as a reminder, that 2019 was a multi-decade low. 30-day delinquencies also remain below
their fourth quarter 2019 level. Lastly, our tax rate this quarter was 4% driven mostly by higher-than-expected
volume of investment tax credit or ITC deals for the rest of the year, and we can expect other income in Q4 will
reflect seasonally higher renewables investment losses when these projects get placed into service.
Okay, let's turn to the balance sheet that's on slide 11 and you can see it ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion, up $31
billion from the second quarter, so not a lot to note here. The driver of the increase was a $34 billion increase in
available-for-sale securities. With cash levels so high, we chose to reduce the cash and just put some of the
money into short-term T bills this quarter, and those earn essentially the same rate as cash. Our cash remains
high at $352 billion. In addition to the cash level change, we saw another $11 billion decline in hold-to-maturity
securities as those securities matured and paid down. And as Brian noted, global excess liquidity sources remain
strong at $859 billion; that's down very modestly from the second quarter and still remains approximately $280
billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019 level.
Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion from the second quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital
distributed to shareholders. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back
$1 billion in shares to offset our employee awards. AOCI was $1.1 billion lower, reflecting both a modest decline
in the value of AFS securities, modestly impacting CET1, as well as a small change in cash flow hedges which
doesn't impact the regulatory capital. Tangible book value per share is up 12% year-over-year. Turning to
regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $194 billion from June 30 and our CET1 ratio improved 30 basis
points to 11.9%; it's now well above our current 9.5% requirement as Brian noted. Risk-weighted assets declined
modestly as loans and Global Markets RWA both moved lower.
Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6.2% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for
balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains well above our requirements. LCR ratios remain well above
minimums for BAC metrics and stronger at the bank level. Let's now focus on loans by looking at average
balances on slide 12. And loan growth slowed this quarter as a decline in demand for commercial borrowing more
than offset our credit card growth, so we saw that lower commercial demand and lower revolver utilization among
higher funding costs. And commercial balances were also impacted by term loan repayments due to borrowers
accessing other capital market solutions. Focusing for a moment on average deposits, and using slide 13, given
Brian's earlier comments I'll just note the comparisons. Relative to pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019, average
deposits are up 33%, Consumer is up 36% with Consumer checking up 45%, and you can see the other segment
comparisons on the page.

Turning to slide 14, let's extend the conversation we've been having over the course of the past couple quarters
around management of our excess liquidity. This slide serves as a reminder of the size of our high-quality deposit
book, the magnitude of deposits we have in excess of those needed-to-fund loans and the way we've extracted
the value of that excess to deliver value back to our shareholders. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans
increased from $420 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021; and as you can see, it
remains high at $835 billion today. That $1.1 trillion of excess liquidity has always included a balanced mix of
cash, available-for-sale securities, and securities we hold to maturity. In late 2020 and into 2021, we concluded
that additional stimulus was going to remain in client accounts for an extended period and we increased the hold-
to-maturity securities portion so we could lock-in value from those deposits.
And we made these investments given the core nature of our customers' deposits. Note the split of the shorter-
term investments in cash and available-for-sale securities and then the longer-term hold-to-maturity securities,
and I'll just draw your attention to just how much cash we have above the actual level we need to run the
company. On the available-for-sale, we would just note the duration is less than six months as it's mostly all short-
term treasuries. And the combination of the cash and available-for-sale securities represents about 47% of the
total, noted on this page, in the third quarter of 2023 to give us the balance we're looking for. And if we look at the
hold-to-maturity book, it had grown from $190 billion pre-pandemic, peaking two years ago, and now falling to just
over $600 billion currently. That $600 billion consists of about $122 billion in treasuries, those will mature in a little
more than six years, and about $474 billion in mortgage-backed securities and a few billion in other.
The hold-to-maturity securities peaked at $683 billion and were now down $80 billion from the peak and $11
billion in the last quarter. That $80 billion decline from peak was all driven by the reduction of mortgages from
$555 billion to $474 billion. With less loan funding needs over the past several quarters, the proceeds from
security pay-downs have been deployed into higher-yielding cash, and this mix shift has been happening at about
a 300-basis point spread benefit for these assets. Given the increased cash rates, the combined cash and
security yield has risen now to more than 3%. It's up more than 200 basis points since the peak size of the
portfolio in the third quarter of 2021 and it's risen faster than the rate paid on deposits. In fact, today it's 178 basis
points above what we pay for deposits. And remember also we have $1 trillion of loans that are largely in floating
rate in addition.
From a valuation perspective, we did experience a decline in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity book this
quarter and that's in the context of mortgage rates reaching a two-decade high. Comparing the valuation change
to the year-ago period, it worsened $15 billion; and over that same time period, we grew regulatory capital by $19
billion and hold Global Liquidity Sources in excess of $850 billion. And importantly, as we move to slide 15, I'll
make one final comment here, which is the improved NII over this investment period. The net interest income
excluding Global Markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in Q3 2020 at $9.1 billion. That compares to
$13.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023 or $4.7 billion higher every quarter on a quarterly basis, and that gives a
sense of the entire balance sheet working together.
Okay, let's now turn our focus to NII performance over the past quarter and we'll talk about the path forward and
I'm going to use slide 15 for that. On last quarter's call, we guided to expect Q3 NII to be about $14.2 billion to
$14.3 billion on an FTE basis. Our third quarter performance turned out to be better than our guidance. And on an
FTE basis, NII was $14.5 billion this quarter. We expect Q4 will be around $14 billion fully taxable-equivalent, and
that increases our full-year year guidance for NII in 2023 versus 2022 to 9% growth for the year. We believe NII
will hover around this expected fourth quarter $14 billion level, plus or minus, in the first half of next year and then
we anticipate modest growth in the second half of 2024. By the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2024, we
believe we can see NII up low single-digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The good news is we believe
8


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
NII will likely trough around the fourth quarter level of $14 billion and begin to grow again in the middle of next
year.
I'd note a few caveats around that forward view I just provided. It includes an assumption that interest rates in the
forward curve materialize and it includes rate cuts for the second half of 2024. It also includes an expectation of
modest loan and deposit growth as we move into the second half of 2024. Focusing again on this quarter, $14.5
billion NII was an increase of nearly $700 million from the third quarter of 2022 or 4% while our net interest yield
improved 5 basis points to 2.11%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest rates and
partially offset by lower deposit balances. On a linked quarter comparison, NII improved $239 million from Q2.
That comes from the benefit of an extra day of interest, a rate hike and higher Global Markets NII, partially offset
by increased deposit pricing. And the net interest yield improved 5 basis points.
Turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at
September 30 was $3.1 billion of expected NII benefit over the next 12 months from our banking book and that
assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast and 95% of the
sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was $3.3 billion. Okay, let's turn to
expense and we'll use slide 16 for the discussion. Previously highlighted that we guided you to a trend of
sequential declines in our expense each quarter this year. And we achieved that in Q3 with our expense down
$200 million to $15.8 billion. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter to go down another couple hundred million
to $15.6 billion excluding any FDIC special assessment. That would mean our fourth quarter expense of $15.6
billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 would be up by only $100 million or less than 1%.
And we're proud of that work by the team, especially considering our regular FDIC insurance expense alone
increased by $125 million quarterly starting in the first quarter of this year. So, without that, we would be flat year-
over-year in Q4. The decline this quarter from the second was driven by the reduction in litigation expense and
lower head count, offset somewhat by investments and inflationary costs. Our head count is down nearly 2,800
from the second quarter to 213,000 and that includes the addition of 2,500 or so full-time campus hires we
brought into the company. So that's good work by the team after we peaked at 218,000 in January month-end.
And you can see the movement here across the past year at the bottom left of the slide. As we look forward to
next quarter, we'd add $1.9 billion of expense for the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC as a
possibility.
Absent that, we'd expect our fourth quarter $15.6 billion expense target to more fully benefit from the third quarter
head count reductions, and that will allow expense to continue the decline experienced throughout the year so far.
All of that is going to set us up well for next year. Let's now turn to credit and we'll turn to slide 17. Net charge-offs
of $931 million increased $62 million from the second quarter. The increase is driven by credit card losses as
higher late-stage delinquencies flow through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate rose
12 basis points to 2.72% in Q3 and it remains below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Provision expense was $1.2 billion in Q3 and that included a $303 million reserve build. It reflects a
macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of
5% during 2024. On slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and our Commercial
portfolios.
And on Consumer, we'd just note that we continue to see the asset quality metrics come off the bottom and for
the most part they remain below historical averages. 30 and 90-day consumer delinquencies still remain below
the fourth quarter of 2019 as an example. Commercial net charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven
mostly by a reduction in office write-downs. And as a reminder, our CRE credit exposure represents 7% of total
loans. And that includes office exposure, which represents less than 2% of our loans. We've been very intentional
9

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
around client selection and portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years and that's helped us to
mitigate risk in this portfolio. We continue to believe that the portfolio is well-positioned and adequately reserved
against the current conditions. And in the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate
and office portfolio stats we provided last quarter.
We've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and our net charge-offs and you can
see all of those on slides 36, 37, 38 and 39. Okay, let's move on to the various lines of business and their results.
And I'm going to start on slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good
organic revenue growth and delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continue to
invest for the future. Note that the top line revenue grew 6% while expense rose 3%. Reported earnings declined
7% year-over-year, given credit costs continue to return to pre-pandemic level. And we believe this understates
the underlying success of the business in driving revenue and managing costs because PPNR grew 9% year-
over-year. Much of the success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts as well as
investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier.
And expense reflects the continued investments by the business for their future growth. Moving to Wealth
Management on slide 20, we produced good results and we earned a little more than $1 billion. These results are
down from last year due to a decline in NII from higher deposit costs, which more than offset higher fees from
asset management. While lower this quarter, NII of $1.8 billion derives from a world-class banking offering and it
provides good balance in our revenue stream and a competitive advantage in the business for us. As Brian noted,
both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth and they produced solid assets under
management flows of $44 billion since the third quarter of last year, reflecting good mix of new client money as
well as our existing clients putting their money to work. Expense reflects continued investments in the business as
we add financial advisors and capabilities from technology investments.
On slide 21, you see the Global Banking results. And this business produced very strong results with earnings of
$2.6 billion, driven by 11% year-over-year growth in revenue to $6.2 billion. Coupled with good expense
management, the business has produced solid operating leverage. Our GTS, or Global Treasury Services,
business has been robust. We've also seen a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter
and our Investment Banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue
growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year ago period. The
company's overall Investment Banking fees were $1.2 billion in Q3, growing modestly over the prior year despite
a pool that was down nearly 20%. And we held on to number three position given our performance.
Provision expense reflected reserve release of $139 million as certain troubled industries and credits outside of
commercial real estate continued to have improved outlooks. Expense increased 6% year-over-year reflecting our
continued investments in this business. Switching to Global Markets on slide 22. The team had another strong
quarter with earnings growing to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth of 10%, and I'm referring to results
excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks
changing monetary policies around the globe have continued to impact both bond and equity markets. And as a
result, it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in our FICC trading businesses as well as a record third
quarter in equities. Focusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA, revenue improved 8% year-over-year to $4.4 billion.
FICC improved 6% and equities improved 10% compared to the third quarter of last year.
And at $1.7 billion, that's a record third quarter for our equities teammates. Year-over-year expense increased
7%, primarily driven by investments for people and technology. Finally on slide 13 all other shows a profit of $89
million. So revenue improved from the second quarter driven by the absence of prior-period debt security sale
losses and available-for-sale securities and partially offset by higher operating losses on tax credit investments in

wind, solar and affordable housing. As I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 4%, and that
reflects a higher than expected volume of investment tax credits in which the value of the deals are recognized
upfront. We also had a small discrete benefit to tax expense from a state tax law change. Excluding renewable
investments and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 25%.
And as we wrap up 2023, we expect our full year tax rate, excluding discrete and special items such as the FDIC
special assessment, we expect that full year tax rate should end up in the 9% to 10% range. So, to summarize,
we grew our earnings double-digit year-over-year, we reported NII that was above our expectations, and we
increased our full-year expectations. We've managed costs aligned with our guidance and brought expenses
down in every quarter so far this year. And we expect to do that again in the fourth quarter. We earned more than
15% return on tangible common equity. We returned $2.9 billion in capital back to shareholders, including a 9%
dividend increase, and we built 30 basis points of CET1, positioning us well for the proposed capital rules. So, all
in all, it was a strong quarter. It was one where our teams executed well against responsible growth.
And with that, David, I think we'll open it up for the Q&A session.

Hey Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Brian, can you come back to your thoughts? You were talking about the consumer spending holding at 4% right
now, obviously down from the very strong levels of a year, two years ago. When you look out – and you
mentioned how you guys are thinking the economy troughs in the middle of next year, do you think you could hold
that 4% consumer spend – do you think your consumers will hold that 4% spending number or could it actually
deteriorate from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think a couple things, Gerard. One is there's obviously external events which could change the situation in the
globe dramatically and so – but given just a pathway that that kind of event doesn't take place, you'd think that the
11


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
rate they're spending at now is consistent with a lower inflation. So, embedded in our team's [indiscernible]
(00:40:03) and the team's economic projections is a return of inflation to the 2% target at the end of 2025, the rate
structure comes down beginning in the middle of next year, but still stays around 4% at the end of 2025. And so,
given that the inflation is coming down, the economy would still be growing and getting back towards trend
growth, I think it would hold steady. And so it's been pretty steady the month of August, into September, into
October at this 4%, 4.5%, 5% level. And that's kind of just people get paid more, they spend a little bit more,
pricing goes up. And then you have the ebbs and flows within it what they spend on.
And right now, you've kind of seen all of the adjustments that came through the pandemic into the last couple
years sort of adjust out of the system. What I mean by that is you have a lot of goods purchased, then you had a
lot of travel, you had a lot of return to office spending. We can track that. People buying stuff. All that's kind of
levelled out of the system including a drop in fuel prices and an increase and basically it's relatively bouncing
around about the same and they're spending about the same amount of money on gas that they spent last year.
So, all that being said, in the big aggregate numbers, I think, yes, it can keep bumping along at that level, which is
consistent with low inflation, low growth economy and effectively shows the consumer has been brought more in
line with the scenario of the Fed reaching their target. That's what we see. Now, it'll take some time for all that to
work through the system and the retail sales number seems to be stronger today, but that all shakes through.
But this is what they're doing at the moment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, you guys give us good detail on slide 8 about the potential changes
coming from Basel III Endgame and you show us obviously the organic capital generation. Can you share with us
possibly some of the mitigation strategies you might use? And specifically if you could touch upon these changes
for the equity investments particularly in the alternative energy space. I guess they're going up from 100% RWAs
to 400%. Would that change your thinking in that line of business as we go forward should they stay in the final
rules?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I think number one, I think the first thing is at the end of November, the comments are due. There'll be
comments by our company, by all the other companies, by industry participants, and then the staff at the Fed will
have to sort through all that and think what they all mean. And there'll be very rigorous points about our views of
the wisdom of the changes, the need of the changes, the balance of the changes, the double-counting, all the
things that you've heard much about. That being said, it is a little puzzling that you see some of the RWA
increases for mortgage loans or for these types of investments in the environmental and housing and other
spaces which is sort of counter to the policy that we want to do it. Now, what would happen is we'd have to adjust
the pricing and it would become more expensive. It's been a great business for us. We continue to drive it.
But ultimately, it'd have to go through the market if you have the equity cost go up by a fourfold increase to get the
returns. And so think about a pricing model, just increase the amount of equity we have to dedicate, therefore we
have to get returns on that and so that would happen. It just seems a little counterintuitive that people would be
doing that on a set of rules that, basically, after the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank put in a set of rules and said
here's how you count the RWA without much evidence that this is an issue for companies because the Volcker
Rule and all the other stuff that are having issues of write-downs or changes here. And so, the idea of going up
four times seems odd to us from a public policy standpoint and also absent any evidence that this is an issue for
the banking system.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, great. Good morning. Alastair, at a conference a month ago you noted that if the Fed is done, you think
deposit pricing is close to its peak, and I think you kind of talked us through that a little bit today. Some of your
peers have been more fearful of a potential future material repricing in consumer savings for example from
greater competition or further outflows. And to be fair, they've worried about that for a while and you've been more
right. But can you just kind of discuss your thoughts on that and perhaps the outlook on deposit pricing in
general?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I mean, Jim, one of the things that I think gives us some confidence around NII troughing and then growing
in the back half of next year is if you think we've seen the last Fed hike or you believe that the last Fed hike is a
month from now or two months from now, then at some point deposit pricing is going to stop going up; and there'll
be a natural lag to that, that's pretty normal. And then what you see if you look forward into the forward curve is
we've actually got Fed cuts, three of them in the forward curve for next year. So, yes, we anticipate there will be
some lag; I don't think we're any different than anyone else in that regard. But we're just pointing out that as we
get towards peak rates, we're getting closer now so we can begin to see the end of that in terms of the later
innings at this point.
And the other thing, just we always have to remind everyone of this is the deposits that we have are very
relationship-based. A lot of them are core operating deposits where we've got the checking, they're thinking about
the way we serve them in terms of digital, we've got Preferred Rewards program. And then on the Commercial
side, very similar; we've got a lot of operating deposits all around the world and they're using our world-class
CashPro product. So there's a lot of relationship value here as well that we need to take into account but
fundamentally, we're just making a judgment that we're getting towards the top of the rate cycle here for Fed
funds and then deposit pricing will sort out in a quarter or two following.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right, that's fair. Maybe given the thoughts that there's three rate cuts in the forward curve and you are asset-
sensitive, but yet you still expect growth or improving growth in NII in the back half, is that just sort of the lag effect
there, too? Or is there something else going on in terms of rate cuts and the impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I think the other things that we've got going on especially as we get into the back half of the year,
Consumer balances are going to find a floor at some point. They again are in the late innings of returning to sort
of more normal pre-pandemic balances per account, so they're going to find a floor and at that point they're going
13


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
to start growing in the same way that Wealth has found a floor and in the same way that Global Banking found a
floor a while ago and is now beginning to grow. So we have a point of view that the Consumer side is going to find
a floor, so that's one. Two is at that point, you're poised for deposit growth but we're also going to see loan growth
through the course of the year. It's been slower this quarter but at some point, you return to a more normal
economy as Brian has pointed out. We're going to see the loan growth, and so we're thinking that's going to start
to evidence itself in the back half.
And then the final thing I'd just say is we have securities reinvestment every month and that's going to support
and grow NII and I think it gives us a sense that we've got a more durable NII stream underneath.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I have – my first question is sort of a two-prong on the balance sheet. Alastair, if you could tell
us sort of how much in cash flow do you forecast your HTM book will have in 2024 as you think about the moving
pieces underneath your NII outlook. And for Brian, clearly this held-to-maturity portfolio has been a thorn in the
side of the stock, and no matter what we say to the investment community the stock hasn't quite caught up. And
I'm wondering as you think about the statistics that you share with us every quarter like net-new checking adds,
maybe give us a little more statistics in terms of the strength of that growth and the strength of that retention
because I think that no matter what sort of print that you have on total deposits at the end of the quarter, there's
always sort of pushback so long as the market is not yet confident that we've hit peak rates. So sort of a two-part
first question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Right. So I'll answer the first part, Erika. I think if you look back through the course of the last couple of years, that
portfolio pay-downs in terms of maturities or pay-downs, it's sort of averaging $10 billion a quarter so I think you
could probably use that as a good starting point for the reinvestment horizon in 2024. That's what I would use and
then I'll let Brian answer the second part of your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Erika, we drive an organic growth machine based on a [ph] responsible set (00:49:37) across all the different
operating businesses. So as you noted, if you look at what's driving our deposit base to be larger than the
industry, i.e., outperform the industry is if you think from every comparison against 2019 to now, and we're up
$250 billion in consumer deposits alone, we also are up probably 10% in checking accounts, net checking
accounts; those are 92% core. The attrition rate where all the deposit balances are in the preferred part of that
segment, the retention rate is 99%-plus. Long-term customers, the Preferred Rewards program drives a basis. On
cards, we're now getting the balances back up to where they were pre-pandemic with even better credit quality
than we had then. We got home equities hit a trough and are starting to work their way out. Auto loans are
starting – we continue to produce a lot.
14


Bank of America Corp.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
The market's not real strong, but it continues to produce several billion a quarter, so all the organic growth
engines in the Consumer business are very strong. When you go to the Wealth Management, we're now
producing net household growth at a faster rate than we produced in the prior years. If you go to the commercial
banking businesses in the US, we noted that we produced more customers this year and that deposit base, those
business banking and middle market segments, those come with a big deposit franchise and you see that those
deposits have actually been stable and growing for the last six months. So the organic growth engine is in fine
shape and just powers through all this and is the strength of the $3-trillion-plus balance sheet and in fact is the
reason that we have $900 billion on a given day that we have to put to work because you're just having this great
engine go on.
And so whether it's investment accounts in Consumer, checking accounts in Consumer, cards in Consumer,
home equity, all that has grown organically dramatically over the last 4, 5, 10 years. And frankly the loan growth
will continue to follow that as conditions improve. And then on commercial side, as people go back to regular line
usage, we saw it deteriorate this quarter largely due to the demand side. And so we feel very good. And then we
talked about the Markets business, gave you the detail there, and the investment banking team is gaining market
share and actually fought to maintain relatively flat fees in a market that was down 20% or something. So we feel
very good about the organic growth engine. That's what powers our company and that delivered $7 billion plus in
after-tax income for another quarter and 15% return on tangible common equity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is for you, Alastair. Do you have any economic ownership of Visa Class B shares
remaining? Our understanding is until the litigation was settled, you weren't allowed to sell it other than – to other
banks in the initial consortium. But I'm wondering if you've sold any economic ownership through swap or if you
still have it on the books because we haven't seen any disclosures on that recently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I mean, we essentially sold and hedged our Visa B position years ago. And then in our Markets business,
we've financed the sale of Visa by other banks. You can think about that as a hedge thing that's just about a
financing. So, depending on how that all develops and what other banks choose to do, we may end up having
some RWA or some liquidity that we can recycle for other clients' benefit in our Markets business. But we don't
have any meaningful economic stake in Visa B.

Erika Najarian Q

Got it. Thank you.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Do you expect the efficiency ratio expenses to revenues to improve from 63% and when? And I guess, this is
a two-part question. One is expenses, as you said, it's down every quarter this year and you're guiding for the
fourth quarter. Slide 5, the digital adoption, it's about [ph] three-fourths (00:53:46) for your clients across the firm.
So the sustainability of those digital trends to help lower expenses or control expenses given some of the
headwinds and especially given the threat of big tech and fintech, sustainability of the digital trends and why you
15


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
think you have an advantage when some of the others think they have the advantage. And the second part of that
question is revenues. Your NIM is a bit over 2%, went up a little quarter-over-quarter, but it was closer to 2.5%
going back five years. And maybe long term it should be 3%; I'm not sure.
So what do you think is the normalized NIM because that would help the efficiency ratio and the trend for
expenses and ultimately the efficiency ratio? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So, Mike, I think the expenses come down, revenue grows, the efficiency ratio continues to improve. One of
the big differences between us and other companies you can compare us to is the size of our Wealth
Management business relative to the size of the company is large. And as you know, that's a business which we
continue to work to make more efficient, but is the least efficient business in the platform. So, Lindsay and Eric
continue to drive the efficiency there. So, yes, we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve. And part of
that will be as the net interest margin normalize that we normalize the size of the balance sheet given its grossed
up for a lot of reasons through the pandemic and stuff and you kind of fine-tune it, you'll get a little more
effectiveness there. And in the past, we ran up to 2.30% NIM in the sort of a normalized sort of environments and
you'd expect us to keep moving up from there.
And it'll be bouncing around here as we work through the trough in NII that we described, which is we're sort of in
the middle of starting this quarter into the first half of next year. So, Mike, and as you know, it's all about managing
heads and that's – last year at this time, we were all talking about the Great Resignation or last year last summer
and how we had to hire people and we over-hired because the issue was could you hire fast enough to get what
you needed. This year, we're able to bring that excess back out of the system and ended up kind of where we
wanted to be at the 212,000. As we think forward, we continue to reposition people around the company who are
freed up because of that digital application to other things. So, in the broad sense, our Consumer business is
down from 100,000 people to 60,000 people and continues to drift down as we continue to use the – that's the
place with the most leverage in digital across the board.
You continue to get less branches, less ATMs, you can see the statistics in the chart, more customer interactions
and more customers. That's a pretty good trade, and we continue to drive that including sales in digital that we
disclose in the back of things. We're running nearly half the sales and frankly with improvements on the checking
account opening, we can drive another round of growth there. So that's what we're going to do – continue to drive
the efficiency ratio to level and we'll see where we can get it to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then just on that big picture question, I mean, you've invested for over a decade in your data and tech stack
and digital engagement, and now we have AI and GenAI as a opportunity and a threat. Why do you think or
maybe you don't – why do you think that you have an advantage versus, say, smaller banks, fintechs, or big tech?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we have an advantage in that we've been applying it for a number of years now. So effectively Erica is a
form of that and now has 17 million customers working on everything. And so think about that. This quarter I think
there's 170 million interactions or whatever the number is, 180 million interactions, something like that. If you think
about that, Mike, in the days gone by, every one of those would have been an email, a text, or a phone call. And
16


Bank of America Corp.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
so it's obviously tremendously more efficient. And we're continuing to prove it. We brought it out to the CashPro
side which is the Commercial side, so that helps. If you think about in the $3.8 billion we'll spend in 2024 on
technology initiative spending, Aditya and the team continue to use the techniques that you read about in the
paper to increase the efficiencies of that development effort. And it's probably 10%, 15% in the short term,
building up higher and higher as people get more and more used to it.
And that'll allow those dollars to be stretched even further, so we think that's a near-term application that we're
already doing and has high probability. And then frankly, if you think about our capabilities, if you look, we have
nearly, I don't know, 6,000, 7,000 patents out there or 600 on AI already, machine learning-related activities sitting
in the application filed. We've got a lot of inventors in this company. And so we feel good about our ability to
compete against the types of people you said. But by the way, we use some of those people who might compete
to actually be providers to help us do this stuff. And some of the big tech companies are, as you listen to them, it's
a business for them to sell that AI capabilities to companies like ours to make us more efficient. So near-term
customer health, near-term employee effectiveness, near-term coding enhancements, et cetera, et cetera.
But one of the things you mentioned is we have invested heavily to have the data and the tech stack ready to go
and three-point whatever billion dollars, 1 billion interactions this quarter digital show that people are ready to use
the services we provide them.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So wanted to start off with a question on expense. You cited head count actions that should provide relief in 4Q
and positive flow-through into next year. Was hoping you could either help size the benefit from expense actions
or just frame how we should be thinking about expense growth as we look out to next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think what we've tried to do this year, Steve, is communicate pretty clearly what our plan was. As Brian
said, we overachieved last year on hiring, so we started the year with 218,000 and expense of $16.2 billion and
we've really been working on the trajectory over the course of this year. So this point of getting the head count to
a place we're comfortable, $16.2 billion turns into $16 billion turns into $15.8 billion. We're now determined to
17


Bank of America Corp.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
deliver on the $15.6 billion and I think that's going to set us up really well. So our plan is to finalize our strategic
planning over the course of the next few weeks and I think we'll give you more guidance next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Great. And just two clarifying questions or cleanup questions on my end. On the NII remarks, you talked about
deposits. I was hoping you could help frame, Alastair, what are the assumptions you're making in terms of
reinvestment yields and loan growth that are underpinning that higher NII exit rate for next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So I'd say reinvestment just assume the forward curve. And with respect to loan growth, I'd use low single-
digits consistent with the slow growth economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And just one quick one here on the tax-advantaged investments. I just wanted to confirm given the long
duration, the 4x increase in capital, are you still planning to fund tax-advantaged investments on the platform
before the rules are finalized or are you going to take a wait-and-see approach?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I mean, this remains something that's important for our clients. We've yet to see a final rule. So we'll be
supporting transactions but obviously, as Brian said, it is informing us with respect to pricing and it's informing us
with respect to appetite. But until there's a change, we'll continue to support the clients in that regard.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. First just to clarify, what's driving the drop in net interest income from 3Q to 4Q? Is that core net
interest income or is that on the market side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, you're talking about the fact that we think that we're going to be around $14-or-so billion in Q4?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I'd say first one is you've got a little bit of deposit pricing lag there, so we got to keep thinking about that. Second
is we're sort of baking into it some continued normalization of consumer balances, so that's just continued to drift
slowly lower. I think third, if we had hoped for loan growth in Q3, we just didn't see that. So that's going to flow
through with lower loan growth balances in Q4. And the only final thing I'd just say is the Global Markets NII may
not repeat in quite the same way. Some of that depends on client behavior. And they benefited this particular
quarter by just long-term rates going up so significantly and that helping the carry side. So it's all those things and
probably a little bit of rate hike probability or timing delay. But it's all those sorts of things. More importantly, it
hasn't changed from our expectation a quarter ago in any way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then just conceptually, as we think about your net interest income guidance for
next year, what if we get higher for longer rates, there's not cuts, is that good or bad versus the guidance that you
gave earlier? Obviously, you've got puts and takes, so some reinvestment on the asset side. But again, coming
back to the deposit pricing issue, I think there's a view that higher for longer eventually drives up those consumer
rates. So what would be the net of those two in the higher for longer? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, higher for longer is going to be better. So you're right. We've got the forward curve in our expectations. If
that doesn't turn out to be the case, we'd expect NII would be higher.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And that's simply the assets you're pricing more on the deposits or you're still thinking there's minimal consumer
deposit or pricing even in the higher for longer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It'll be both. I mean, there'll be the repricing for sure, and in addition we'd expect to capture a little bit of margin
from any short-term rate hike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Understood. Thank you.

John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Yeah. I was hoping you could give a little color on what you're seeing on credit, your outlook as you look at roll
rates and migrations. How are you thinking about the trajectory of charge-offs in the near term?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, John, I'd just point out as you can see the trajectory, we've laid it out on the slide, most all of the net charge-
off increase over time has been really due to card and consumer card. And the charge-offs at this point are still
lower than they were in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was a stellar period. And I'd anticipate in the short term
that you'd see things begin to, well, just continue that trend because it normally follows 90-days past due
delinquencies, and those are up ever so slightly again this quarter. So we're inching closer to the fourth quarter of
2019. And at some point, that's going to begin to stabilize. From there, it's just a question of what does the
economy do. So right now, as Brian's pointed out, we've got a slow growth economy in the plan. So I'd anticipate,
as we get back towards that kind of fourth quarter 2019 number, it's going to normalize in there. But from that
point on, it will be very economic dependent.
On the commercial side, the asset quality has been excellent. And the only place where we've got particular
elevated concern is office, which is a very small part of our portfolio. It's less than 2% of our loans. But the
commercial side has been terrific. And again, that will depend on how the economy plays out and whether we're
talking about a soft landing, whether we're talking about a recession, or whether we're talking about robust
growth. So, all of that's going to have to play itself out. With the commercial numbers being so low, that one could
bounce around a little bit, but it's only because it's coming off a base that's so low at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
John, just one thing on – as you think about the commercial credit. Remember, we have a strong disciplined
ratings change, ratings capability in this company. And so we are pushing through the reviews of the commercial
real estate portfolio, et cetera. We put them on criticize quickly. We deal with the charge-offs and that's why
you've seen it come back down already. And we're adjusting those activities, as we show in the slides in the part
of the deck, to current appraisals under current market conditions, under current rent rolls, et cetera. So, even
though it's a very small part of our portfolio, frankly a lot of the issues are through the system for us because the
high ratings integrity and ratings conservatism we've had in this company for many, many years and that holds us
well.
And I'd always remind, if you think back like in the oil and gas thing in the end of 2015, 2016, we put up all of this
reserve that was pre-CECL and then ended up bringing it back in because the charge-offs were very modest. So I
think we feel very good about the original underwriting, but you also have – because of our ratings integrity on the
office part of the portfolio, we pushed a fairly significant amount through reappraisal and relook, and we had the
CECL reserves but importantly the charge-offs are falling already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. And one bigger picture question as you think about the Basel III and the opportunity to mitigate and
optimize. Does a 15% ROTCE feel like a good aspiration for the company over time, Brian, through the cycle? I
mean, I'm recognizing that's where you are already today. But as you factor in the potential for new rules, how do
you think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So I think the simple way to think about it is, if we're doing it on $194 billion of capital, which we did at this
quarter, and you need about another say $10 billion to put a buffer on the end state need, $10 billion, $11 billion,
20


Bank of America Corp.
(BAC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
$195 billion plus 0.5%, which is our normal buffer without any mitigation, that would be a very modest increase of
$10 billion over $200 billion, let's make it simple, and that would hit the ROTCE a bit, and I'm sure we can figure
out ways to price to get that back.
But remember we're different than everybody else, John, because we're actually sitting on this amount of capital
today. And so we are getting a 15% return on it. So don't take that as saying I agree with the rules, but saying
we've got to deal with the cards that are dealt to us. The rules say that you have to have $195 billion plus about
$10 billion cushion and maybe a little bit more cushion, but depending on for 50 basis points or so. But we're
doing 15% today. So that'd be a slight dilution to that number, but not something we couldn't make up, and that's
before any mitigation on us. And there is always mitigation; you know that, you've been around this industry for a
long time. So there's always mitigation in how you construct things, what you'll do, what you'll not do, and I fully
expect there'll be modifications in the rules which ought to help also.
But I think the simple point is we earned it on that amount of capital today so it's not like some calculation I have
to think through; it's right there today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Yeah. That's good perspective. Thanks, Brian.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Alastair, question. Just want to clarify your NII comment. So if rates stay higher or better, are you
implying that rate cuts would therefore be negative for you from an NII standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I'm saying right now, Vivek, that if you think about what rate cuts look like in the back half of next year, in
the absence of that we might guide NII higher. Yes, that's what I'm trying to communicate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And is that because you have that many floating rate assets that will reprice faster than you can cut funding
costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. On the way down, I'd anticipate that as rates are going down, it's going to cut into our margin on our
deposit spreads. So that's essentially what we're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Vivek, I'm just listening to you and Alastair. I think remember, the forward curve has multiple cuts in it next
year and I think the question earlier was if those didn't occur, what would happen. And I think Alastair said NII
21

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
would be higher if those cuts didn't occur. It's not a rate that just mathematically, that's 75 basis points in the
second half of next year of not being cut would hold us higher because of all the deposits being worth more and
the floating rate assets holding pricing up better. Dominant part of our balance sheet. I just sensed that you were
talking by each other but maybe not.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thank you. Just a follow-up on the securities portfolio on the AFS side. Alastair, how much of that $180 billion is
still swapped? And can you kind of help us understand like what the kind of all-in yield is on that book and if you
would still also have repricing help going forward on that book as well as you had mentioned earlier on the HTM
maturities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So most of the book we swapped to floating and we've tried to establish that over the course of time. So
you can almost think about most all of the available-for-sale securities repricing kind of every day, every week,
every two weeks, whatever it may be. So that tends to look a little bit more like the cash-type moves over time.
There's a few securities in there that are fixed rate but very little in terms of the total complexion, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That helps. Thank you. And then just wanted to also say on the fee side, obviously, another really good job
both on the investment bank and the trading businesses. Still an uncertain environment, just wanted to get your
thoughts. You were able to hold IB fees flat sequentially which was, I think, better than you had indicated. Just
your thoughts on reopening here in the markets and how you're kind of expecting the business to hopefully act,
albeit understanding it's still an uncertain environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So this is I suppose unusual and not unusual. Investment banking obviously has the potential for swings in
fees. And what's interesting about this one is we've now been bouncing around this sort of $1.1 billion per quarter,
$1.2 billion per quarter. And normally, investment banking you'd expect to return within a year or so and we're
now seven quarters into this. So we've got a good pipeline and mostly, what I think corporate America and around
the world C-suite executives are looking for is the confidence that comes from macroeconomic certainty,
geopolitical certainty. So for as long as we've got the volatility, it's going to stay in this kind of a range. But if you
were to look back in periods past, investment banking can come back very, very quickly to a more historical range
of kind of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion per quarter. It's just that we've grown tired of predicting when that
might be, Ken.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Ken, let me give you two other pieces. One, the pipeline still is strong. But more importantly, Matthew and
the team have done a good job of building out our capabilities to serve our huge middle market client base or
global commercial banking client base under Wendy's leadership, and that number is growing quickly. And that's
a market which we're relatively unpenetrated in. We had good market share with our clients that we did business
with, meaning investment banking business with, and so that's generating probably better performance for us than
others in terms of holding our position flat relative to up a little bit year-over-year, flat year-over-year versus a
down market. So we basically doubled the size of that team and we'll double it again; it's that kind of opportunity
for us.

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. My question was around deposit growth and what level of deposit growth you think you need
from here. Should it be in line with loan growth or are you happy to let some of the more maybe non-transaction
deposits run off? And the reason I ask is because as noted in some of the prior questions, some of your peers are
saying that there's more room for consumer deposits to reprice higher, especially core checking accounts. It sort
of sounds like you disagree with that, so wanted to assess how much you might need to respond if competitors
act differently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So a couple things. One, just broad-based, we have $1.9 trillion in deposits and $1 trillion of loans, so we have a
tremendously high deposit base. But also, if you look at the slide 5 or whatever it is, we show the deposits by
business. In the Banking business, Global Banking, I think six quarters we've been relatively flat and starting to
grow off of that. That is fully priced; it's not like corporate treasurers wait around to talk to you about what you're
paying, and in a non-interest-bearing percentage that has drifted down. The amount they hold in excess of that –
part of that to pay fees has been relatively stable, and so we feel very good about that. You look at Wealth
Management, basically all the movement has been made pretty much to the higher-rate environment, i.e., buying
treasury securities directly. If you look in our Wealth Management business, the amount of short-term cash-
oriented-type investments, money market funds and et cetera, treasuries, et cetera, it's gone from like $500 billion
to $700 billion or $800 billion over the last couple years.
So that move has taken place and so the rest of it is now in a relatively stable base and you can see those
numbers flattening. If you go to the Consumer side, there's basically two or three things. One is in the more
medium income households, plus or minus, you're seeing the slow spend-down. Even though you still have
multiples of what they had pre-pandemic in their accounts, and even though that's a small part of the overall
deposit base, there's still the slow trend where that's drifting down as all the things you read about go on. In the
higher-end part of that base, in the broad consumer base, they're actually below the pandemic by about 20%, and
23


Bank of America Corp.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2023
that's because they moved the money into the market and you can see that in some of the preferred category
pricing. So where people think about checking and money markets and this, I always have thought about it a little
more straightforward which is transactional cash and investment cash.
The investment cash has largely been re-suited across the businesses. The transactional cash holds because it's
money in motion moving every day. And for our Consumer business, that's represented by the $0.5 trillion of
checking account balances you can see on the page with some modest amounts in money markets and stuff that
are carried as the cushion people have. And if they moved the money to market, they've moved it. And so we're
watching consumer because there's a little more drifting there and it's up $250 billion since pre-pandemic and
you're saying you have the dynamics of loans, student loan repayments starting. That's 1 million of our customers
pay student loans. You have the dynamics of interest rate impacts on cash carry of loan balance that's higher.
And that'll sort out but just takes a lot longer; that's across 37 million people, so the impact takes a while to sort
through. And so we feel good about it, but I think people are looking by category and this and that.
You have to think about it more how a customer, whether it's a business or a consumer behaves. And what we've
seen them is adjust their behavior based on their household circumstances and largely through the system and
most of it coming a little bit slower in consumer just because the natural question if there's lot of stimulus went in
those accounts, what do I do with it over time, and now they're doing something with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful detail. So, I guess, just in terms of deposit growth from here, would you still prefer to grow
deposits in line with loans or is there a little bit more room for that to come down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We prefer to grow deposits in line with customer growth and activity. So, in the last four quarters, in Consumer, I
think we're up another 900,000 net new checking accounts, which average balance is around $11,000. They
come in at lower than that and mature up to that. We have a transactional banking business for all types of
customers, and we grow it irrespective of it. That produces $2 trillion. You have a loan business to customers, that
produces $1 trillion, and that difference then is a wonderful thing to have every day.

Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I have been looking at your average balance sheet on page 8 of the supplement
and I noticed that in this quarter your overall yield on earning assets was up 20 basis points and lo and behold the
yield on interest-bearing liabilities was also up 20 basis points. And I'm curious was there some benefit unusual,
the lower amortization or something like that, or is it just a function of that behind all the moving parts the balance
is better than you'd thought?

Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I don't think it was an amortization issue. I think it was just the way the entire balance sheet works across
assets, liabilities when you think about all the various moving pieces. So I don't think there's anything particularly
notable there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q

Okay. No. It's just stunning with all the moving pieces how the earning asset yield and the liability yields really

Operator: For our final question today, we have a follow-up from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Brian, trading has grown nicely. And equities you said it was led by financing. Is there room in your
balance sheet from a capital standpoint to keep growing that? And second question related to trading would be, in
your guidance on NII for next year, what are you assuming for trading NII in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Let me just hit the first one and Alastair hit the second one. The capacity, if you think about the constraint on
RWA, as you know, Vivek, in your experience in the business that equity financing is not RWA intense but it is
size-intense. When you look at us with our CET 1 leverage ratio 100-plus basis points over the requirements, we
have lots of room on the asset size if we want and the return on equity – and the return on the risk in that
business is very strong. So Jim and the team have done a good job and [indiscernible] (01:22:55) on the equities
side and we continue to experience, so there's plenty of room. And in fact, we have brought the balance sheet up
by over $200 billion largely due to the financing side and a lot of that due to equities and we can continue to do
that if the clients need the capabilities and products. So that's the simple answer. Yes, there's a lot of capacity,
and largely driven by our huge capital base and on all the size measures, we're way over the requirements.
I think 100 basis points on that is probably almost $50 billion of overage so you have a lot of room to go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And then, Vivek, in terms of the NII guidance, we include Global Markets in there. So it's just part of a big
diversified portfolio. I think we would point to Global Markets remains liability-sensitive. You can see that in the
way NII has come down in 2021 and 2022 and into 2023 with rates going up. So it'll perform according to the rate
curve, and then we may put a little bit of modest balance sheet growth in there, as Brian pointed out, just to
continue investing in the business. But it's in the NII guide and it will follow the forward curve.

So, thank you for joining us. Just in closing, I'd go back to the key points. Strong earnings for the company,
earnings growth year-over-year for the three months and nine months in double-digit. The returns of 15% return
on tangible common equity were very strong. We have the capital to meet the new capital rules as proposed
before any mitigation, before any changes in those rules. And we're returning 15% on net capital today. So we
feel good about the path ahead for the company. We'd continue to do it the old-fashioned way: growing our
clients, growing our revenues from those clients and driving responsible growth. Thank you.
