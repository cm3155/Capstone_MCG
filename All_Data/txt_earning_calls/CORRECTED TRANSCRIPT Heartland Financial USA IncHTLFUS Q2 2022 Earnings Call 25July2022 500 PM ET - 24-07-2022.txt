MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the HTLF's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. This afternoon, HTLF
distributed its second quarter press release, and hopefully you've had a chance to review the results. If there is
anyone on this call who did not receive a copy, you may access it at HTLF's website at htlf.com. With us today
from management are Bruce Lee, President and CEO; and Bryan McKeag, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. Management will provide a brief summary of the quarter, and then we will open the call up to
your questions.
Before we begin the presentation, I would like to remind everyone that some of the information management will
be providing today falls under the guidelines of forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. As part of these guidelines, I must point out that any statements made during this
presentation concerning the company's hopes, beliefs, expectations, and predictions of the future are forward-
looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Additional information on these
factors is included from time to time in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, which may be obtained on the

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Also joining us today is Nathan Jones, our Chief Credit Officer, who can answer questions regarding credit
quality, which continues to be quite strong.
HTLF had an outstanding second quarter, reporting $49.9 million of net income and EPS of $1.17. Core EPS is
$1.15 after both positive and negative one-time events, which clearly exceeded expectations.
We are moving forward together. We have sustained our momentum as we continue to execute our strategy and
drive results, with strong growth in loans, deposits, and revenue. In the second quarter, we delivered our best
quarter ever for organic loan growth, increasing $552 million, or 5%, from the linked quarter, excluding PPP, and
again, significantly exceeding our guidance of $200 million; deposit growth of $559 million from the linked quarter,
our credit quality continues to be excellent, with nonperforming assets holding at 34 basis points of total assets,
and delinquencies at historic lows. And total assets are a record $19.7 billion, an increase of $428 million, or 2%,
from the linked quarter.
Let's start with loan growth highlights. We saw continued strength across our commercial business with growth in
every commercial loan portfolio. From the linked quarter, commercial and industrial increased $245 million, or 9%.
Owner-occupied real estate increased $17 million, or 1%. Non-owner-occupied real estate increased $160 million,
or 7%. Construction was up slightly by $3 million, and our Ag portfolio increased $70 million, or 9%.
In the second quarter, we added 322 new commercial relationships, representing $328 million in funded loans
and $37 million of new deposits. Notably, all originations were of higher credit quality than the overall portfolio, as
measured by risk ratings and credit scores. And 66% of these loans have variable rate structures compared to
43% from last year.
Our investments in talent continue to deliver results. Our commercial pipeline remains strong at over $2 billion,
consistent with previous quarters. And we expect to grow commercial loans by more than $250 million in the third
quarter.
I've had many conversations with our customers regarding the business trends they're experiencing and their
outlooks. While certain headwinds, such as inflation, supply chain, and staffing persist, our customers remain
optimistic for the rest of the year and cautious about 2023. In our consumer loan portfolio, we saw a strong growth
of $37 million, or 9%, from the linked quarter. Residential mortgage increased $20 million, or 2%, from the linked
quarter.
Overall, each of our 11 banks had positive organic loan growth, with Arizona Bank & Trust and Citywide Banks in
Colorado leading the way. We delivered another quarter of deposit growth. Non-time deposits totaled $16.1
billion, an increase of $534 million, or 3%, from the linked quarter.
Total deposits grew to a record $17.2 billion, an increase of $559 million from the linked quarter and our 13th
consecutive quarter of total deposit growth. We maintained our excellent deposit mix. 94% of deposits are in non-
time accounts. 35% of total deposits are in noninterest-bearing accounts, positioning us well in a rising rate
environment.
Our deposit strategy continues to serve us well. Total deposit costs remained low at 15 basis points. Our
efficiency ratio decreased significantly to 57.7%, driven largely by both increased revenue as we executed our
growth strategies and a reduction of core expenses. Competitive pressures remain for top talent, and we are
executing an employee retention strategy that's been successful since implementation. This is an area we're
closely monitoring as wage inflation and demands for top talent continue to be high.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Turning to key credit metrics, our disciplined credit approach has delivered excellent credit quality across our
portfolios. Delinquency ratio is at a historic low of 6 basis points. Nonperforming loans represented 59 basis
points of total loans at the end of the second quarter, a decrease of 4 basis points from the linked quarter.
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained low at 34 basis points. Nonpass-rated loans
decreased to 5.8% from 6.3% in the linked quarter. Lastly, in the second quarter, we reported net charge-offs of
$700,000, or 3 basis points annualized, of average loans.
We are delivering against our ambitious and disciplined growth strategies, which were developed by our
management team and unanimously approved by HTLF's board of directors. We have considerable momentum
and are positioned for continued growth and progress against our goals of: organic loan growth, new customer
acquisition, attracting and retaining talent, controlling expenses, branch and geographic optimization, and
maintaining strong credit quality. We will also achieve growth by consolidating our 11 separate bank charters into
a single HTLF bank charter in Colorado. This will create operational and cost efficiencies and unlock capacity that
supports both – growth both organically and through M&A.
Our 11 banks will maintain their local brands, local leadership, and local decision-making. In June, we
successfully executed the first of 11 bank charter consolidations, with Citywide Banks becoming a division of
HTLF Bank. We're pleased with the smooth transition and the progress on the project overall. Four other banks
are slated to convert this year. We expect to finish charter consolidation by late 2023 and deliver $20 million of
annual savings and capacity after the project is complete.
We will also continue to optimize our branch network. In the second quarter, we sold two branches and closed
seven. Over the past 18 months, we have reduced our total number of branches by 21, from 142 to 121. This
represents a 15% reduction in branches.
Our strategy and accomplishments continue to be recognized by local and national media. Nielsen report ranked
HTLF among the top US commercial credit card issuers for the seventh year in a row. We continue to
demonstrate consistent strength in the commercial payments space as HTLF saw a 48% increase in purchase
volume growth in 2021. Nielsen report's ranking reflects HTLF's innovative approach to digital technology
products in providing excellent customer education and experiences. Awards, recognition, and strong
performance result from the hard work and dedication of our employees. I want to thank them for their ongoing
commitment to deliver strength, insight, and growth to our customers, communities, and investors. We move
forward together because together, we are HTLF.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials.

Thanks and good afternoon. As Bruce outlined, this was another solid quarter for HTLF, with earnings per share
of $1.17, loan growth of $552 million excluding PPP, strong revenue growth, improved expense levels, and
continued favorable credit trends. Included in this quarter's results were the following large items. Gain on sale of
two Illinois branches was $3 million, gain on sale of a small insurance sub was $400,000, and a gain on the sale
of our VISA B shares was $1.9 million. Against these gains were losses on the sales securities of $2.1 million and
charter consolidation restructuring costs of $2.4 million. Altogether, these items increased pre-tax income by just
under $1 million and increased earnings per share by about $0.02. I will cover these in more detail throughout my

comments. I would also remind everyone that both our earnings release and second quarter investor presentation
are included in the IR section of HTLF's website.
So I'll start my comments as I usually do with the provision for credit losses, which totaled $3.2 million and was
unchanged from last quarter. This quarter, the provisioning for loan growth was partially offset by favorable
underlying credit trends. More specifically, non-performing loans were down slightly compared to last quarter, and
loan delinquencies remained historically low at 6 basis points of total loans, and net charge-offs were minimal at
$714,000 this quarter.
At quarter end, the allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for credit losses
on loans and unfunded commitments, increased $2.5 million to $119.1 million or 1.12% of total loans. In addition,
at quarter end, unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled $13.2 million or 12 basis
points of loans.
Moving to other balance sheet items, investment balances rose just over $80 million to end the quarter at $7.3
billion, representing 37% of assets with a tax equivalent yield of 2.46% in modified duration between five and six
years and producing monthly cash flows of $65 million to $70 million.
During the quarter, we took the opportunity to reposition some of the portfolio by selling just over $150 million of
securities that yielded 2.1% and used the proceeds to repurchase new securities yielding 4.3%. The loss on the
repositioning was largely offset by the $1.9 million gain we realized on the sale of our remaining VISA B shares.
The tangible common equity ratio decreased 96 basis points to 5.56% at quarter end and reflects 115 basis points
decline due to the decrease in market value of investments and some balance sheet growth. That was partially
offset by a 19 basis points increase from higher retained earnings. HTLF's regulatory capital ratios remain strong,
with common equity tier 1 at just under 11.2% and total risk-based at 11.1%. So the balance sheet continues to
be very strong and well-positioned.
Moving to the income statement, starting with revenue, net interest income totaled $142.5 million this quarter,
which was $7.8 million higher than the prior quarter. The main drivers of the increase were strong loan and
deposit growth together with the impact of the Fed's short-term interest rate increases and a low level of deposit
price increases. This quarter also included $2.5 million decline in PPP interest and fees to $1.8 million from $4.3
million last quarter. We exited the quarter with just under $700,000 of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on
our books.
Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis rose 10 basis points this quarter to 3.22%. Due to the recent rate
increases, investment yields improved 30 basis points and loan yields excluding PPP were 10 basis points higher
while interest cost also rose 10 basis points. This quarter, the net interest margin includes 7 basis points of
purchase accounting accretion, which is up 2 basis points from the prior quarter.
Non-interest income was flat compared to the prior quarter at $34.5 million. However, excluding gains and losses,
core net non-interest income was $36.7 million, up almost $4.8 million and exceeded our projections. The main
components were, first, a strong increase in deposit service fees of $2.8 million. That does include our usual
annual VISA incentives of $1.3 million and other non-interest income was up $4 million due to a $1.8 million
increase in commercial swaps and syndication fees and the previously mentioned $1.9 million gain on the sale of
our remaining VISA B shares. These positives were offset somewhat by weaker wealth management fees and
mortgage banking revenue due to rising interest rates. So core revenue trends were positive for both net interest
income and fees, and we believe revenue can continue to trend positive through the rest of 2022.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Shifting to expenses, non-interest expenses totaled $106.5 million this quarter. That's down $4.3 million from last
quarter. Excluding restructuring, tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, our core expenses decreased $3
million to $106.8 million compared to $110 million last quarter, and came in a little better than projected. Almost all
expense categories were flat to down this quarter, with the most significant improvement coming in salary and
benefits expense which decreased $2.1 million due primarily to a decline in FTE count of 121 for the quarter. As a
result of the strong revenue growth and core expense reductions this quarter, the second quarter efficiency ratio
improved significantly to 57.66%.
While looking ahead, we believe second quarter results provide significant momentum that will continue into the
back half of 2022. This is highlighted by, first, loan pipelines which, as Bruce mentioned, remain strong and
support our expected loan growth rate of 2% to 3% per quarter. Non-time deposit growth is expected to slow into
the 1% range per quarter. Assuming no additional Fed changes, net interest income is projected to grow in the
mid-single digits on a percentage basis next quarter, reflecting continued loan growth and a full quarter impact
from the June Fed rate increase, with some offset from some lagging pressure on deposit pricing.
The expected Fed increase of 75 basis points in July is projected to increase net interest income by $9 million to
$10 million on an annualized basis assuming our normal deposit ratio of about [ph] $40 million (20:36). Provisions
for credit losses should remain near current levels given the projected loan growth and assuming net charge-offs
remain below historic levels for the rest of 2022. However, changes in economic projections could have a
significant impact on future provisions should a stronger recession began to materialize.
Core non-interest income, excluding gains and losses, is expected to normalize into the range of $32 million to
$33 million per quarter, with higher commercial deposit swap and syndication fees helping to offset lower
mortgage banking and wealth revenue as rates continue to rise.
Core expenses are expected to decline slightly into the $105 million to $106 million range over the next two
quarters. However, inflationary pressures, particularly wage inflation, remain challenging. [ph] Other (21:34)
consolidation restructuring costs are expected to be in the $2.5 million to $3 million range next quarter and in
total, we estimate $14 million to $15 million of remaining costs over the next two years. Consolidation benefits
have already begun to layer in and will continue to do so over the next two years. We remain very confident that
in total, they will reach $20 million on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed in late 2023.
And finally, we believe a tax rate of 22% to 23%, excluding new tax credits, is a reasonable run rate.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Bruce for some questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a Q&A, a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]

We are. Thank you, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just want to – great, great. Just want to start off with loan growth. Really solid quarter this quarter and the
commentary implies that you're remaining on track and you have another good visibility to the pipeline and things
look good. Could you just talk a little bit about what areas of the footprint are providing these opportunities and
kind of just what some of the expectations are for the drivers of the growth over the back half of the year, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Damon, we really had solid growth across our entire footprint for the first time since I can remember maybe
since I've been here at HTLF. All 11 of our banks had organic growth. We did have sort of outstanding growth in
Colorado, in Arizona and in California, and a fair amount of that California growth was attributed to the
Agribusiness group.
But really everybody was – had very, very solid growth. Our focus has been C&I activity and that's why you saw
that be the most significant segment. As you know, the [audio gap] (24:06) group is doing well as is real estate.
And I also do want to point out our consumer group just had a really outstanding quarter as well with their growth.
So we're really pleased that it's occurring throughout our footprint and in all loan categories. And maybe the most
important thing, the credit quality of our new originations, we're very, very pleased with and that the originations
are in – we have flipped from – flipped to more of a floating rate mix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, Bryan, as it relates to the margin, the commentary kind of points towards a continued rise
in the margin. You think you could kind of replicate the amount of core expansion you saw this quarter or do you
think that the cost of deposits kind of catches up a little bit with another 75-basis point rate hike and could kind of
way weigh in a little bit on the pace of expansion?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Yeah. I think it could a little bit. I think if I went back and looked what I would have said last quarter, for a 75-basis
point rate increase, it would have been a higher number than the $9 million to $10 million I said in my comments
and that's because we are expecting the betas to be more normal. However, we're going to try and do our best to
keep those deposits within where the market is, but we'll see. It really is going to depend on what the market
does.
But there could be a little bit of lag, too. I think I mentioned we had really good – that June looked really solid with
the first 75 basis points coming in. We only got a few – really a few weeks of that increase and some of our loan
growth came towards the end of the quarter. So, those couple, I really feel good that we can raise the core or
raise the net interest income line by that mid-single digits over what we posted this year or this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Damon, maybe just to add to Bryan's comments, our margin expanded in June more than it did for the
average for the quarter, so that gives us some momentum. And then also, we ended the period – the quarter end
period, about $200 million more in loans than the average during the quarter. So, just those two things alone give
us a very positive feeling about expanding our margin in addition to the three quarter's rate hikes that everybody's
anticipating. But as Bryan said, for the first time of all these hikes, we really think we're going to get into our
deposit betas. We've done a great job of really holding our deposit rates down over these first couple of [audio
gap] (27:06).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay, great. And then just final question on the – regards the capital and the TCE ratio down to 5.56%, I
know a good portion of that is attributable to the AOCI impact and stuff. But does that have any – does that
provide any concern for you guys as far as the pace of growth you're seeing with loans that maybe you need to
slow down a little bit because of that level getting into the mid-5s? Or do you feel like it's really a temporary item
and it's not really going to be a constraining factor for you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I don't think it's going to be a constraining factor on our loan growth. It may – certainly, we'll look at the investment
portfolio and how we reinvest the cash flows and we'll see what deposit dollars flow in as well. I think if we could,
we'd probably manage to a flat to slightly up earning assets, not hyper growth in the earning assets partially
because of the – keeping the TCE under control. But we're not going to hold back on loan growth because of this.
This won't slow us down.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I know some of the focus lately has been on larger
loans and I'm just curious if that's kind of what drove the loan syndication fees to the level they were at now. And I
guess then similarly, like what was the average size of the loans that were added to the portfolio this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the average still was relatively in that million-ish [ph] style (29:19). I'll look this up, but off the top of my
head, I think it was around $1 million, give or take, which is slightly probably higher than our average.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's about double historically our average, Andrew, but you've got to balance off some of those larger loans and
the syndicated transactions with a really strong quarter in small business and business banking loans as well.
We're really focusing on all of them, not just one area at the expense of another.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. So, I mean I guess so what's your outlook for the syndication fees? I guess what's the
pipeline for the larger loans then?

Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We feel pretty good about the third quarter with what we already have either closed or what's in our
pipeline. But the other area that we feel real good about the capital markets is on our interest rate swaps. So
between those two, we feel that we can probably replicate maybe even another $1 million or so in the third
quarter above where we were in the second quarter. But as Bryan said, that's really offsetting some wealth fees
as well as some mortgage fees.

Hi. So, yeah, just wanted to kind of get a sense for the process of the Citywide conversion. What do you think the
customer employee sort of reaction, if any? But just – I think being the first one, kind of as you got through that
process, any takeaways from how it shapes how you do successive conversions to come? I think you said you
got four left this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So Jeff, let me take a crack at this first and then I'll let Bryan follow. So, first of all, we've done a lot of M&A
over the years. I mean we've always felt that doing M&A is kind of a core competency. That's really what we're
doing here except we're using all the same systems. So what we're doing here is really going from 11 different
instances into 1. We're going into one ABA routing number, which in Citywide's situation, their routing number
didn't change because that's the routing number that we're using for HTLF Bank. Overall, we have about 22,000
duplicate accounts, which means 11,000 customers are going to need a new account. There's a complete
process in place to go through that. It includes the bank leadership, and that was really the first experience at
Citywide and it went very, very well.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
The thing that we've learned over the years, Jeff, is you just have to communicate, communicate and then
communicate more with both our customers and our employees. But what I would tell you is that the Citywide
customers are very excited, once we complete this project, that they can utilize our branches in California and our
branches in Arizona as they travel or vacation or winter. So they are very, very happy about the expanded access
to our branch network.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And I would just add, Jeff, I think, behind the scenes from what I can see, what I hear at least from my folks
in finance and some of the operations folks is we got through pretty well. You always expect a couple bumps, and
I think there probably were a couple bumps, but they were minor and they were very – the type that we believe
are going to be something we can cover in future ones.
All that being said, as Bruce said, this first one is a little bit easier, right? It's the same charter, and you know all of
that. The next couple are the ones we really have our eyes on. We feel good about it, lots of planning going on.
But I think the part that Bruce said about the customer communication and how we handled the duplicate
accounts, if we can continue to have that work the way it did in Citywide, that will be a big positive because that's
usually the biggest customer impact, and we handled it well in this one. If we can keep handling those well, I think
we're going to have continued success here, which we expect to and we're planning to.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Right. Thanks. Switching gears a little bit, just wanted to see if there was any update on kind of the May fraud
events, if there was any progress on recovery or any movement within that group of those two instances of any
update on that front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Nathan, you want to take that one?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely, Bruce. Well, they were really – we do look at them as one-time events and we have continued –
we took a conservative stance and quickly addressed them with the charge-offs. But we do continue to work on
them [ph] from (35:08) longer-term resolutions and have several positive things that have occurred that we are
working very hard at, along the lines of [ph] establishing (35:16) additional collateral, and then also working with
one of the customers to work their way out of it through the general business operations. So we do feel good
about that. Just nothing at this point we can start to book any offsets at this point.
Bruce or Bryan, anything you'd like to add on top of that? I'm sorry, Jeff. Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
No, I didn't want to cut anyone off. But as a follow-on, Nathan, just wanted to kind of get a sense that through
those situations, was there any procedural or structural changes that you've made or kind of you said they're one-
offs, but did it kind of lead to any changes or revisiting any practices from that end?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
It has. We have – we always use anything that occurs as to really sharpen our pencils and make sure that we're
as clean as we can be from a credit perspective. So in both instances, we've used it as a learning opportunity to
really improve our overall processes and hopefully help protect us from any future issues that are similar in
nature. But we were able to use that as an opportunity to learn and grow from it and implement some
enhancements.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Maybe one last one, if I could, just real quick on the fee income run rate, I think Bryan mentioned $32 million to
$33 million. That – so that will exclude any securities gains or losses. Is that correct, you'd kind of treat that as a
zero?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, it does. I kind of took that with the $36 million – let me just find my number here so I can tell you how I
thought about that. Yeah, when you get to the core and then you back out the VISA B gain, so the core I was
talking about was $36.7 million, which excludes all gains and losses. But that VISA B gain was sitting in other
noninterest income, which is a category I don't back out. So if you back that out, it gets you to $34.8 million this
quarter. And if you take another $1.3 million out because of the VISA B share, while that's recurring every year, it
doesn't recur every quarter. So if you took that out, you're in about the $33.5 million range. And as Bruce said, we
expect that the syndication fees can offset the downdraft we might see in wealth management and whatever. So,
that's how I came to kind of $33 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Bryan, thanks for all the – all your thoughts on the financial outlook. I've kind of run through my list there, the one
thing that caught my eye this cycle was the Specialized Industries, it wasn't in the last quarter presentation. So I'm
just wondering how you manage the credit risk in some of those businesses, and some over the last, call it, three

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
to five years have triggered some losses really across the industry, the franchise, finance, and healthcare in
particular. So, I guess, maybe talk about the growth, and more importantly, how it's kind of smart growth for your
shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Terry, I'm going to – I'll take that first, and then I'll let Nathan follow up. So, these are – first of all, from our
perspective, it's more kind of the middle market or lower end of the middle market. It's a specialized group that we
brought in, who this is what they've historically done. And they play what I would call above where we've
historically played at the bank level.
And so we brought in people that do – that are specialized in these various areas. And more importantly, we also
brought in corresponding talent on the credit side to match it up. So we didn't just take our existing staff and say
we want to go after this market. We brought in people and we grew the area very specific, just like the
Agribusiness that we acquired, where we acquired the staff out in California. We acquired both on the origination
side, the underwriting side, and the credit side. We feel that if you're going to go into a new area, you need the
new expertise across the board.
Also these larger type of customers are buying more of our fee services, whether it's in Treasury [audio gap]
(39:45), whether it's Retirement Plan Services, interest rate swaps, the ability to do syndications. So they're really
[audio gap] (39:54-40:09) our corporate card business, which was up pretty dramatically on a year-over-year
basis. So we feel that that is the – a segment of [indiscernible] (40:19) grow. We'd love about a third of our
business to come from sort of traditional bank activity, about a third from the Specialized group, and about a third
from the Agribusiness group until that group builds its portfolio and then that would slow down.
Nathan, do you want to maybe address how you supported it on the credit side with additional analytics and
talent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely, Bruce. And as Bruce has kind of noted, we do have a dedicated credit team within our
organization that's really dedicated against our HSI, or our Specialized Industries group, and they are some of our
strongest talent and most experienced. But even on that, we've really gone through and done very, very exacting
and detailed work to make sure that we have really strong supporting guidance, and then providing the necessary
support and analytics to make sure – from what we feel is really top quartile.
So we're really not leaning in hard from a credit perspective, but more making sure we're getting that top quartile.
So we're not taking significant credit risk there. And then what we're taking, we have a pretty significant analytics
to supporting behind it, along with a strong, strong credit team that's able to evaluate and make sure that we
understand the risk we are taking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And the other thing I would...

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2022
Thank you both for that. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Terry, the other thing I'd mention is the risk rating of that portfolio and those originations, the quality of the
credit is better than the rest of our portfolio. And that's really part of the strategy. We wanted to go out market a
little bit in part of our originations, not ignoring anything else that we do. We want to do – really do it all. But the
credit quality is the key, along with the dedicated credit staff that Nathan described.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, Bruce, a follow-up, where do you need to be in the charter consolidation before you seriously look at
any M&A opportunities? I know M&A is in the company's DNA. But also once the conversion is complete, as you
talk about, there's just increased capacity to really drive that future growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, the reality is with where – with the uncertainty in the economy right now, I think any M&A is really a
2023-type scenario. However, what I would say is that the way that we have built the charter consolidation is that
any strategic M&A that we would have that would be on the bank side, not a fee business of some sort, we could
stop the charter consolidation and work on the M&A and then go back to the charter consolidation. So, I mean,
the reality is we're going to be halfway through it by the start of 2023. And if an opportunity came up, we would be
ready to do it in 2023, an M&A transaction, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Thanks again. Have a nice night.
