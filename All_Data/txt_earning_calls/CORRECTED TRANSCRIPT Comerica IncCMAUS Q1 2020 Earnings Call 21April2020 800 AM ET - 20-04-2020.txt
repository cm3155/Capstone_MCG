Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I hope you and your families are healthy and managing
as best as possible during this unprecedented time. The first priority for me, along with our leadership team and
Comerica as a whole, is the well-being of our customers, employees and communities.
Comerica has quickly adapted to the COVID-19 crisis. I'm extremely proud of the work our team has done to
ensure we continue to deliver the same high level of service. We currently have over 65% of the Comerica team
working from home. This transition happened quickly and without any significant issues. For those who cannot
work remotely such as operations and banking center colleagues, we have taken precautions to minimize health
risk and increase compensation to show our deep appreciation for their dedication to continue to provide essential
services.
To further support our employees, we have made monetary assistance available for dependent care and
telehealth services at no cost. Also, we have been working closely with our customers to provide financial
assistance, such as providing additional liquidity as well as payment deferrals and fee waivers. As an SBA-

preferred lender, we have been assisting customers in accessing the government SBA Paycheck Protection
Program under which we have, thus far, provided $1.8 billion in loans.
Finally, serving our communities is more important than ever at this time. Therefore, Comerica together with
Comerica Charitable Foundation have pledged $4 million to nonprofit organizations that care for and provide
critical services to our communities. These funds will be deployed to support strategic programs designed to meet
the needs of small and micro businesses, as well as community service organizations that serve youth, seniors
and other vulnerable populations, particularly those organizations addressing food and security and access to
healthcare. Helping our customers and communities navigate this challenging environment by providing our
expertise, products and services is at the heart of Comerica's relationship banking strategy.
Turning to slide 4 and a summary of our first quarter results; due to a large increase in our credit reserves, we
reported a loss of $0.46 per share. With the forecasted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the
economic impact of social distancing and continued stress in the energy portfolio, we prudently increased our
credit reserves to over $900 million or 1.71% of total loans. Our reserves reflect our adoption of CECL, which
incorporates a life of loan methodology. While there's a great deal of uncertainty about the duration and severity
of the impacts related to COVID-19, we are closely monitoring our portfolio and proactively reaching out to
customers. We believe that our reserves are appropriate and we are currently well positioned.
Average loans in our Mortgage Banker business, which serves mortgage companies, decreased with seasonally
lower home purchase activity and a decline in refinance volumes for the quarter. Also, National Dealer continued
to decline due to lower inventory levels. However, total period-end loans increased over $3 billion to a record
high, as customers drew on their credit lines beginning in mid-March to meet cash needs and to build liquidity
buffers. Also, period-end Mortgage Banker increased at a record level as refi activity picked up as rates declined.
Following strong, seasonal deposit growth in the fourth quarter, average deposit levels remained relatively stable.
After the typical decline in January, deposits increased throughout the quarter. Relative to the first quarter last
year, average deposits were up $2.8 billion or 5%. Net interest income declined with the Fed's action to reduce
interest rates. Concurrently, we have taken action to appropriately adjust deposit pricing.
Noninterest income declined with a decrease in noncustomer-related activity, including a reduction in deferred
compensation returns, which is offset in expenses, as well as a gain on the sale of the business in the fourth
quarter which was not repeated. In addition, following robust volume in the fourth quarter, syndication activity
slowed as economic uncertainty increased. Expenses decreased $26 million as we maintained our discipline,
including a $15 million decrease in salaries and benefits. This resulted in an efficiency ratio below 57%, well
below the peer average of 58.4% in the fourth quarter.
Capital remained strong. We suspended our share repurchase program last month, as we focused on deploying
our capital to meet our customers' growing financial requirements. The tone of recent conversations I've had with
customers across our markets reflects the challenges of the current environment. It is important to note that, in
general, over the past several years, our customers have remained cautious, prudently managing expenses and
reducing leverage and anticipation of eventual economic downturn. And while the environment has turned
abruptly, we all remain hopeful that COVID-19 will be contained soon, and with the economic stimulus that has
been provided globally, business will return to normal quickly.
And now, I will turn the call over to Jim to review the quarter in more detail.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
James J. Herzog
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turn to slide 5. Average loans decreased approximately $900 million
in the first quarter. As Curt mentioned, Mortgage Banker decreased following very strong refi activity in the fourth
quarter and typical slow home sales in the first quarter. This is the data reported by the Mortgage Bankers
Association. Also, loans decreased in National Dealer with lower inventory levels, particularly in January and
February. Energy declined on a decrease in CapEx and slightly better capital market activity early in the quarter.
These declines were partly offset by continued growth in Commercial Real Estate driven by multifamily projects
where we work with proven developers who provide substantial equity up front.
Loan activity picked up significantly in the back half of March with the rapid change in economic conditions. The
increase in period-end loans to a record $53.5 billion was due to a combination of customers drawing on lines to
meet higher operating needs, as well as building cash reserves in a time of uncertainty. Mortgage Banker loans
peaked at quarter-end with rising refi volumes.
Also, as widely reported, companies, particularly larger customers, drew down on lines to ensure they had excess
cash as a buffer. As a result, our line utilization increased to nearly 57%. In and of itself, we do not see this as a
sign of credit issues. Mortgage Banker, General Middle Market and National Dealer customers typically have a
borrowing base and/or financial covenants that govern the amount that can be drawn and, therefore, curtail risk.
Further detail is provided on slide 20 in the appendix. Since quarter-end, line usage has leveled out. It is of the
outmost importance that we support our customers' important needs at this challenging time. We are proactively
reaching out to customers to determine their needs and provide our expertise. We are granting amendments on
addressing loan pricing as appropriate. Loan yields were 4.19%, a decrease of 24 basis points from the fourth
quarter. This was a result of lower interest rates, primarily one-month LIBOR.
Slide 6 provides details on deposits. Average balances were relatively stable, included a $300 million reduction in
average noncustomer brokered deposits. Typically, deposits decline in the first quarter. In fact, first quarter
deposits in each of the last four years have declined $1.5 billion or more. This year has been different. In line with
my comments regarding line draws, we believe customers are conserving cash and holding on to excess liquidity
in this time of uncertainty.
Interest-bearing deposit cost decreased 16 basis points as a result of a full-quarter benefit of actions taken in the
fourth quarter as well as recent rate adjustments made in conjunction with the Fed action in March. Total funding
costs remained low at 60 basis points, primarily due to the large portion of non-interest-bearing deposits as well
as the floating rate nature of our wholesale funding.
As you can see on slide 7, our MBS portfolio was stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady. We
opportunistically pre-purchased a portion of second quarter expected payments that relatively attracted yields.
This resulted in the period-end portfolio balance being a little higher than our target of around $12 billion. We had
a modest decrease in prepays in the first quarter, but we expect they will pick up in the second quarter. We don't
expect this to have a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium which remains relatively
small.
Turning to slide 8; net interest income declined $31 million to $513 million, and the net interest margin was 3.06%,
a decline of 14 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. The negative net impact of lower rates was $15 million
and 8 basis points. Interest income on loans declined $47 million and reduced the margin 21 basis points. The
major factor was lower interest rates, which had a $27 million impact and 16 basis points on the margin. Also
5

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
contributing to the decrease were lower balances, one less day in the quarter, and lower loan fees. Lower non-
accrual interest activity and other portfolio dynamics, such as a mix shift in the portfolio, including an increase in
higher quality, lower yielding loans, provided another headwind.
A slightly lower yield on the securities portfolio reduced net interest income by $1 million. Interest on deposits at
the Fed had a $2 million negative impact or 4 basis points on the margin. The lower Fed funds interest rate had
an impact of $4 million or 2 basis points, and higher balances of the Fed added $2 million but resulted in a 2 basis
point drag on the margin.
Deposit costs declined by $14 million and added 8 basis points to the margin, primarily a result of our prudent
management of deposit pricing as interest rates declined, as I previously discussed. Finally, with lower rates,
wholesale funding cost declined by $5 million, adding 3 basis points to the margin. In summary, given the nature
of our portfolio, our loans repriced very quickly. Also, we continue to closely monitor competitive environment and
our need for liquidity as we manage deposit pricing.
Slide 9 provides an overview of credit. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $279 million to $916
million or 1.71% of total loans. This reflected our expectations for the impacts of COVID-19 and social distancing,
as well as the continued pressure on Energy. We adopted CECL in the first quarter. For modeling purposes, we
used economic forecast through March 31 to inform us as we determined the allowance. There's a high degree of
uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic impact of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of the
government stimulus packages and payment deferrals. Therefore, we also considered qualitative adjustments
based on more severe or benign forecast for certain sectors.
We considered more severe assumptions for areas where we have the most concern, such as those more at risk
due to social distancing as well as auto production, leveraged lending and energy. This forecast includes GDP
declining anywhere from 13% to 33% in the second quarter. It is important to note that we are starting the cycle
with very low levels of criticized and non-accrual loans. As you can see in the table, putting Energy aside, net
charge-offs were only $17 million or 13 basis points. In addition, total non-performing loans were a mere 45 basis
points and criticized loans remained low at only 4.6% of total loans as of quarter-end.
Energy loans, which are outlined on slide 10, were about $2 billion at quarter-end and represent 4% of our total
loans. E&P loans make up about 80% of the Energy portfolio and energy services, which is considered the
riskiest segment, was only $55 million. Volatile oil and gas prices have resulted in more stress in the Energy
portfolio, evidenced by increases in criticized and non-accrual loans, as well as charge-offs. Therefore, we
increased our reserve allocation to more than 10% of Energy loans.
Spring redeterminations were approximately 8% complete as of March 31 and, as of yesterday, 16% complete.
So, we are still very early in the process. With the decline in energy prices, we expect to see a relatively
significant decrease in borrowing bases as well as collateral deficiencies. As we've done in previous cycles, we
aim to work with customers to cure deficiencies through a repayment over time.
Our energy customers were acting prudently, cutting costs and reducing CapEx in order to preserve liquidity. The
ultimate outcome will depend on the duration of the cycle. With more than 40 years of serving this industry, we
have deep expertise and remain focused on supporting our energy customers. Overall, our customers are well
positioned and have weathered many cycles.
Slide 11 provides detail on segments we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. We are closely
monitoring and working with customers in areas where social distancing is having a serious impact such as
6

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
hotels, retail, and recreation-related businesses. Our exposure to any one of these industries is not significant,
and there are many areas where we have no exposure such as franchise restaurants or consumer credit cards.
I've already covered energy. In regard to auto production, we have a long history of working through economic
cycles and two-thirds of the loans are to middle-market companies. At quarter-end, there were only $9 million of
non-accrual loans in this sector. We are always closely monitoring our leveraged loans which tend to be with
middle-market, relationship-based customers, sponsors, management teams, and industries we know well. Also,
our sweet spot would be in the lower end of the leverage spectrum. We've increased our allowance allocation for
loans in these areas. As Curt mentioned, we maintain a well-diversified portfolio, which is a fundamental part of
our credit strategy to help minimize losses during times of stress.
Turning to slide 12 on non-interest income which was impacted by non-customer activity. This includes deferred
comp asset returns of a negative $3 million, a $7 million decline from last quarter. Recall this is offset in non-
interest expenses. Also, during the fourth quarter, we benefited from the sale of our HSA business for a gain of $6
million. Customer derivative income was $9 million, a decline of $4 million as record derivative sales of $22 million
were offset by a $13 million negative credit valuation adjustment due to the decline in interest rates.
Commercial lending fees decreased $8 million following near-record high syndication activity in the fourth quarter
and fewer deals in the first quarter due to economic uncertainty. There was a $3 million decrease in card fees,
partly due to lower transaction volume. Fiduciary income increased $2 million with strong sales. Note that market-
related fees are billed on a one-month lag. Therefore, the recent decline in equities and money market rates is
expected to be reflected in the second quarter.
Expenses declined $26 million, as shown on slide 13. Salaries and benefits decreased $15 million due to a
number of factors. Deferred comp was lower, as I mentioned on the previous slide. Incentive compensation,
including annual executive stock grants, was lower as it is tied to our performance. In addition, we had a reduction
in contingent workers and seasonally lower staff insurance, as most employees have not yet met their healthcare
deductibles. Seasonally higher payroll taxes partly offset these reductions.
In addition, outside processing fees decreased $13 million as the new accounting standard resulted in a $7 million
reclassification of software expense. And recall in the fourth quarter, we paid a $4 million vendor transition fee.
Seasonality drove a $4 million decrease in occupancy expense and a $3 million decrease in marketing expense.
We continue to carefully manage cost, as evidenced by our efficiency ratio, which remained solid at under 57%. In
line with current environment, Comerica's conservative approach to capital and liquidity management positions us
well to meet our customers' needs.
Slide 14 provides an overview of our strong liquidity position and funding base. We have ample access to multiple
funding sources with 75% of our funding coming from relationship-oriented deposits, of which nearly half are non-
interest-bearing deposits. At quarter-end, we had approximately $4 billion on deposit at the Fed. Through the
Federal Home Loan Bank, we have almost $10 billion available to draw at very attractive rates.
At quarter-end, we held $7 billion of unencumbered liquid securities in the form of treasuries and mortgage-
backed securities, which had an accumulated unrealized pre-tax gain of over $400 million. Finally, we have ready
access to brokered deposits as well as the discount window of the Fed, if necessary.
Our capital levels remained strong, with an estimated CET1 of 9.51%, as shown on slide 15. In the first quarter,
we returned a total of $283 million to shareholders, including an increase in the dividend to $0.68 per share and
7

the repurchase of 3.2 million shares. Last month, we suspended repurchases, as we focused on deploying capital
to meet customers' financial requirements and providing an attractive dividend.
Note that we have elected to defer a portion of the transitional impact of adopting CECL, which provided a benefit
of 10 basis points to the estimated CET1 ratio. As we navigate the current environment, we expect our capital
levels to remain strong. While our first quarter CET1 ratio is below our 10% target, we expect to return to this level
when the economy improves.
Slide 16 provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter. We are assuming recessionary
conditions, including a significant decline in GDP and increases in unemployment. Given the high degree of
uncertainty pertaining to the economic impacts of COVID-19, as well as the government stimulus, we do not feel
comfortable providing a full year outlook at this time.
We expect average loans to grow with increases in Mortgage Banker due to spring home sales and continued
strong refi volumes. Also, we expect elevated line usage to continue, as we support customers' liquidity needs,
including loan advances under the government's Paycheck Protection plan lending program. Partially offsetting
this, we anticipate businesses to have lower financing needs as a result of reduced working capital and CapEx
requirements.
We expect average deposit growth in conjunction with customers conserving cash and receiving distributions
under the stimulus program. We believe this will mostly be offset by business customers using funds to meet high
operating needs. The net impact from rates alone on net interest income is expected to be $55 million in the
second quarter relative to the first quarter based on our autonomous LIBOR forecast. This expectation includes
the full quarter effect of the March Fed cuts combined with the actions we've taken to lower deposit rates. Of
course, actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors such as movement in LIBOR, which remains
somewhat elevated relative to the Fed funds through quarter-end. Loan growth is expected to provide a partial
offset to this rate headwind.
Credit quality is expected to reflect the economic environment which is highly uncertain and, therefore, makes it
impossible to provide clear guidance at this time. Of course, the largest variable is the duration of severity of
COVID-19 and the resulting effects. The current credit reserve was based on recessionary scenarios. However,
we are in unchartered waters. In addition, CECL may cause greater volatility in our provision.
We expect noninterest income to benefit from an increasing card fees with higher transaction volumes as
customers receive the government stimulus funds, partly offset by lower merchant and commercial card activity.
On the other hand, a reduction in economic activity and lower market-related fees is expected to have an impact
on derivatives, investment banking, fiduciary, and brokerage activity. Deferred comp, which was a negative $3
million in the first quarter and was offset in expenses, is hard to predict and is not assumed to repeat.
We remain focused on controlling expenses and are closely managing discretionary spending. However, we
expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees. Also, we expect COVID-19-related
expenses to rise with increased compensation for employees who are not able to work remotely as well as
measures we've taken to protect employees, such as providing masks and intense cleaning of facilities. In
addition, we expect seasonal increases in annual merit, staff insurance and marketing. As far as capital, I
mentioned on the previous slide, we have suspended the share repurchase program and are focused on meeting
customers' financing needs as well as maintaining an attractive dividend.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Over our 170 years' history, we have managed through many economic cycles. We have
demonstrated our resiliency and our ability to work cohesively and leverage our ingenuity and entrepreneurial
spirit in order to persevere to the Great Depression, two World Wars, and the great financial crisis. We have a
long-tenured, experienced team which is able to adapt to the rapidly changing environment as well as support our
customers as they navigate these challenging times.
It is at times like these that you build and solidify loyal customer relationships. Our geographic footprint is diverse
and we lack reliance on any one industry. As discussed, we significantly increased our credit reserve in the first
quarter. Of course, it is impossible to gauge the ultimate impact of the pandemic. But we believe our conservative
underwriting standards, prudent customer selection, and history of superior credit performance through the last
recession demonstrates our ability to weather the current cycle. We are also focused on maintaining our expense
discipline.
We look forward to returning to business as normal and we are taking steps to ensure we are prepared to serve
our customers when the economy rebounds. With strong liquidity and capital levels, we are able to meet our
customers' growing financial needs as appropriate, and are focused on maintaining an attractive dividend for our
shareholders. In summary, during times of stress, we believe our conservative approach to banking serves us
well.
And now, we would be happy to take your questions.

As you looked at the loan loss reserve and as you decided on the magnitude of the additions, I just want to get
some color on how you thought about through-cycle losses, as particularly how that would break out for the
overall loan book, but also for Energy. How would you think about that that could play out this time around?
Thanks.

Good morning, John. CECL, it's not a stress test. It's not about calculating your through-cycle losses. It's really an
accounting exercise. And so, we did our best to build our reserves appropriately given what CECL calls for. I think
we feel really good about the number we came up with. We used the most recent economic scenarios that were
available. We even kept our books open a couple days to make sure we got that. And I think that 1.71% ratio is a
really solid number, and we feel good about where we ended up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. Great. And then when it comes to the dividend, I just heard your comment about your focus on
maintaining an attractive dividend. So, I guess, just give us your thoughts around your ability to maintain it as the
credit pressures weigh here and considering the hit to your common equity that we saw this quarter. I'm also
curious, where do you see your common equity ratio playing out in a stressed scenario? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
John, I'm going to start answering your question and ask Jim to fill in a few details. First, let me just reiterate what
I think many of you already know, and that's that we have done a very good job of returning capital to our
shareholders the last few years both in terms of our buyback as well as raising our dividend. And so, we remain
focused on leveraging capital really first to meet loan grades, but we also want to provide really a healthy and
competitive dividend to our shareholders.
And obviously, right now there are a lot of unknowns, a lot of uncertainty. We're uncertain around for the duration
and depth of the economic cycle and how long the COVID-19 situation will last. But today, based on what we
know, we feel comfortable on our capital position and our dividend. And I'll turn to Jim for some more color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I would just supplement that with we do stress test for dividend and that's a ongoing exercise. We do, at least,
once a year. With very strong levels of parent company cash which is very important when you want to maintain
the dividend, we took very healthy reserves this quarter and we still have strong capital, so we feel good about
that. And then when I look at the earnings projections, as things start to normalize with credit, we certainly believe
the dividend can be managed within the context of those earnings even in a low rate environment. So, even
though no one can predict how future might play out with COVID over the next several quarters, what we're
seeing in the near and medium term, we feel good about the dividend and believe that can be maintained.

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe starting off, just in terms of the Energy portfolio, I
obviously saw you guys increased your reserve to over 10%. Can you just help us understand? Like from our
perspective, you have a very large reserve on the Energy portfolio. Another bank, for example, might have a
much lower reserve on their energy portfolio. How do we from the outside know whether the reserve is because
you're being much more conservative than other banks perhaps, or because the credit quality of your portfolio
might not be the same as theirs? Thanks.

Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Ken, as you know, with CECL, the main driver particularly this quarter maybe more in any other quarter is the
economic forecast. And so, the economic forecast had a lot to do with the reserves that we decided to build for
Energy. And so, we made some assumptions about where our oil prices are going to be over a reasonable and
supportable period.
The other point that we just gave as kind of a gut check was – we felt this – felt worse than what we went through
a few years ago and we decided that we wanted to make sure that that number was above where our reserves
were in the last downturn. So, that 10.5% exceeds the reserves that we had last time, and we didn't need all those
reserves last time. But we felt the severity here was worse.

And do you feel that portfolio quality is worse this time around, less severity or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. No, I feel the opposite for a couple reasons.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
One is, I think our E&P borrowers are, for the most part, less leveraged. We have a lot less energy services than
we had in the last downturn. Energy services contributed 45% of our credit losses in the last downturn with only
15% of the portfolio. Today, we're out of that business. And then I think the most important factor really is our
portfolio is smaller. It's about doing too smaller than what we had going into the last downturn, and I think that is
probably the biggest factor of all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That helps out. And then just one last question, in terms of the NIM impact, I noticed obviously your
guidance is based on LIBOR, 78 basis points. It looks like it's down about 12 basis points already this quarter.
Can you just remind us like what the sensitivity is to, say, I don't know, a 25 basis point reduction on one-month
LIBOR on the NII? Thanks.

James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. I can probably offer you a very crude rule of thumb just in fairness because I know you guys are trying to
get the models right. Obviously, LIBOR has been jumping around quite a bit, it got lower and then went back over
100 basis points, now it's back down again. So, depending on how COVID plays out will ultimately dictate the
stress on the economy where LIBOR ends up at. But you could probably apply to that about $700,000 a quarter
for the – in terms of LIBOR. And I would warn you that's a very crude rule of thumb, it depends on when during
the month LIBOR might go up or down and resets occur. But just to be transparent, that hopefully gives you a little
bit more information.

First, just a follow-up on your commentary around the energy reserve. How much of that is specific reserves and
how much is qualitative of the 10%?

Yeah. By specific, you mean cited, right? And so, that's our...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
For specific credits rather than – I mean, because you're implying that a lot of the build versus peers may have
come from just your model assumptions. So, I'm trying to delineate between what's model, what's specific to the
individual credits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, I understand. It's a little bit more complicated than that because we also increased our loss given
default in the process. And so, that did make it really apples-to-apples on what portion was just driven by the
standard versus the qualitative. But it was – very little of it was cited reserves because our criticized at the end of
the quarter was still reasonably low.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jennifer, I don't have the breakdown. My sense of it is that a clear number of them would have come from those
carve-out portfolios. But I would say also many were really borrowers that really didn't need deferrals. They
looked at – asking for the deferral is just really an insurance policy for their liquidity. And so, I wouldn't necessarily
jump to the conclusion that all of the deferrals that we granted were to troubled borrowers at all.

Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Hey. Well, you didn't plan for an oil environment like this. I can't imagine. I mean, I know there's some flukes
with these negative oil prices, but it seems like the oil prices, as you look out ahead, would be below the level
where the Fed's stress test takes place, and it might be below the level where you have your own stress test. So,
can you talk about the impact of the oil price, like, where it is today and what that could mean for losses and how
that differs from the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Mike. As you know, it's not so important where oil is today or next week or even a month from now.
It's where it's going to settle in over the longer period of time. And so, the – and that's because two-thirds of our
borrowers can generate positive free cash flow before CapEx with oil really in the 20s. Only about 10% of our oil
portfolio needs oil to be in the mid-30s or higher to generate positive free cash flow before CapEx.
The more, I would call it, intermediate concern is going to be liquidity. We're using much lower price decks and
given where prices have gone over the last month to determine what our borrowers' borrowing bases are. And so,
as those borrowing bases come down, some of our borrowers are going to get squeezed from the liquidity
standpoint.
In this environment, more than ever, we need to work with them. We need to bridge them to a point where prices
stabilize, demand stabilizes, supply stabilizes, so that we can get them to a point where they can just function in a
more normal environment. So, that's the way we kind of see this playing out. I'm not so focused on where prices
are in right now today, but try to bridge to a point where prices stabilize.

Mike Mayo Q

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
No. Well, again it's – when you're – we're going to be triaging the portfolio and it is not one blanket answer. But
the bottom line here is, not just Comerica, but all the banks, we're going to be working with our borrowers to just
get through it. And the ones that continue to be supportive, we're going to be very supportive of them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

Okay. Last two, reports that banks are creating shell companies to own the assets, is Comerica considering doing
anything like that? Are you allowed to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yes to own, but not to operate. We're not a big enough energy player that we would consider operating energy

I'm sorry, Mike. Can you say it one more time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
What are the limits that Comerica can place on E&Ps on outspending cash by leaning on revolvers, if any? I
mean, what kind of control do you have over the borrowers and what they do with the money?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. So, there are not a lot of restrictions in that regard. But if they are using the money for distributions or
something that's not going to be accretive to their borrowing bases, they know that wouldn't sit very well with the
banks and I can't imagine any of our borrowers doing that. In fact, I would say – I've been really pretty pleased
with the way our borrowers are handling this so far. They're really cutting back on expenses. They're cutting back
on CapEx. They are using whatever little free cash flow they have to pay down debt and we have not seen very
many defensive draws at all.

be what?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I would say we're going to get through this. We have a very long 170-plus year history of getting through a lot of
different downturns. We'll get through this one as well. We have a diversified portfolio. Energy is only a very small
piece of our portfolio. In fact, ex-Energy, our portfolio is really in great shape. Our charge-offs were pretty nominal
this quarter again. So, we go into this downturn with a really – so I think a position of strength from a credit quality
standpoint. We got line issues, in particular, Energy. We got our eye on the social distancing portfolios. But as we
work through this with our customers, I think we'll get through it fine.

Good morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to John and Steve's question on the dividend. My
understanding is that automatic restrictions on the dividend don't kick in until you breach that 7% CET1 level, and
then the restriction is a 60% payout on trailing eligible net income. I'm wondering if the same rules apply on Tier 1
capital if you sell below 8.5%. And as we go forward, what are the RWA considerations that you have on hand in
order to prevent further erosion in capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Right. Yeah. Good morning, Erika. Yeah, the same restrictions do apply to all levels of capital, so it would be
8.5% for Tier 1 and as you know and I think you've asked in previous calls, Tier 1 is our binding constraint. We
don't anticipate getting down, 8.5%. Obviously, we get them very strong at over 100 bps of that level, the
estimated 9.51%. Again, unknown where COVID is going to take the industry, but we do not anticipate going
down to that level. But you did rightly point out that risk-weighted assets is probably the biggest variable. It's got
the potential to move the capital ratios even more in provision or net income.
17


Comerica, Inc.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
And we're watching that. This is a very different type of crisis. We know that in the last Great Recession, we had
some initial line draws. But ultimately companies de-levered and risk-weighted assets shrank and that really drove
up capital ratios. It's unclear if that's going to occur in this crisis, it's more of a demand destruction crisis. It's not
clear that customers will de-lever. Some obviously have drawn up. But it just remains to be seen where that goes.
So, risk-weighted assets will drive a lot of this. We are appropriately right-sizing Comerica with customer
commitments. We're there for them. But where there's larger commitments than perhaps need to be, we are
talking to customers about just making sure those are right-sized to meet their needs. And then we'll just have to
monitor the risk-weighted assets. We'll do the right things for the customers and we'll see where demand from all
this goes over the next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, I might just add and maybe ask Peter to add a little color just around what we're seeing in terms of draw
activity with customers. But our first target is always taking care of our customers. That's why we're here. We're a
relationship bank and we're going to make sure that our customers are taken care of, and those that are operating
well and those that are working through difficult situations, as Pete alluded to earlier. But, Peter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter L. Sefzik A
Executive Vice President, Executive Director, Business Bank-Comerica Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Well, I would just add to what Jim said earlier on the call that we saw utilization go up into the first quarter and a
little bit into April. But since then, it's really kind of tapered off. And I think our customers are well positioned going
into Q2 and the rest of the year. So, I think that we haven't seen a whole lot more active defensive draws or
drawing down lines than we did sort of that first end of the quarter and at April.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. And my second question is, everybody is grappling with what cumulative losses can look like in the
industry, and Comerica has clearly had a very strong history on C&I. So, if I'm looking at the regulatory data
correctly, cumulative losses of 2.25% in 2009 and 2010 in C&I and in 2002-2003 cumulative losses of 3%. And
I'm wondering if we carve out your Energy portfolio, which is clearly uniquely stressed, if those are good starting
points for two-year cumulative losses as we look forward in terms of the type of recession that we're going to have
and the impact on your C&I portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
So, Erika, let me give you a couple data points and hopefully this would help. So, first of all, just comparing
ourselves to the Great Recession, this recession – every recession, of course, is going to be different. And, of
course, we've got the social distancing segment of the portfolio which is different this time around that we didn't
have to be concerned about in 2008-2009. But if you just compared our book today to 2008, we have made a very
concerted effort over the last 7 to 10 years to make it more recession resilient.
And so, if you look at the lines of business that were, what we call, recession-susceptible, going into 2008, they
totaled 31% of the portfolio. Today, we've reduced that by 20%. So, now, those businesses that we consider most
susceptible to recession are only 25% of the portfolio today, and that includes Energy. Energy is in that kind of –
that 25%. If you just take a look at our reserves today, our peak reserves are right about – from a dollar
18


Comerica, Inc.
(CMA) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
standpoint, right where they are today. Now, the coverage ratio was higher in 2010 when the coverage ratio
peaked, but that's because primarily due to the downturn, our loans ran off a bit. But from a reserve standpoint,
the $1 billion that we have in reserves right now is very comparable to what we had in the downturn.
And then, lastly, some stress test numbers. Our last DFAST was 2017. That was $2.2 billion. We have had two
stress tests with our models since then, one in 2017 which was $1.9 billion and then one in 2019 at $1.4 billion.
So, our reserve levels today, as a percentage of those stress test losses, are 48%, 67%, respectively. So, I think
the takeaway there is, I think our portfolio is better positioned than we were going into the last downturn, and I
think we're better reserved as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And just one last question, just a little help in understanding PPNR as clearly that's the first line of defense
in terms of absorbing provisions, does your net interest income outlook for 2Q include the impact of PPP loans?
And also, as we think about your card fees, clearly there's going to be lower transaction volumes. But can't the
Direct Express business benefit from the stimulus packages? And could that be an offset from the pain that we're
seeing or we're modeling in terms of the exit rate in transaction volume?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Erika. Number one, the PPP impact, we made an attempt to factor that in to the overall outlook. But it's
really unknown in terms of how it's going to affect income because a huge variable with PPP is how long loans
are outstanding, when they pay off, how many are forgiven. So, we took a stab at it, but I think there's a lot of
uncertainty with all the banks in terms of how it's all really going to impact the financials. And, of course, we're
primarily focused on just making sure we're taking care of customers, period.
Regarding Direct Express, in my remarks, you might recall that I mentioned that we expect card fees to actually
be up in the second quarter. So, stimulus payments being processed is a component of that. And so, we have
factored that in.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Just in terms of thinking about your diversity, you guys happen to also have a lot of specific
industry expertise in areas that might be pretty severely impacted. So, I'm wondering if you could kind of walk
through how Mortgage Banker, Auto Floor Plan, the Equity lines business, Tech and Life Sciences. Can you just
talk about what you're seeing and hearing in those businesses? And to the extent that you expect volumes to
change just underneath the line draws in each of those areas. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. So, I can take it from a credit standpoint; maybe, Peter, can take it from more a revenue standpoint. I
mean, the Mortgage Banker and Equity Fund Services businesses are fairly low risk businesses there. Our
Mortgage Banker portfolio, as you know, is all conventional mortgages. Our source of repayment on those is the
secondary markets. They could get disrupted for a short period of time. That's okay. We've seen that before.
We've worked through that with our borrowers and eventually when the markets stabilize again, they were able to
reduce their warehouse lines.
Equity Fund Services, very clean portfolio. The LPs are institutional, very strong type of borrowers. We would not
expect to see credit issues at all develop in that portfolio. Technology and Life Sciences tend to be up and down,
not just in cycles like this, but it can be up and down when cycles are strong. And so, for instance, when the
economy is strong, multiples are high. And sometimes our venture capital firms are buying companies at very
high multiples. That results in charge-offs for us. So, in kind of a more – just more difficult market for equities, it
sometimes translates into better results from a credit quality standpoint in that portfolio.
Automotive would be certainly one we have our eye on. Those companies are very volume dependent. They have
high fixed cost. And so, when auto volumes drop off, we tend to see some migration there. I would say though
that we've got a lot of confidence in our people in Michigan that manage the risk in their portfolios. They've been
through a lot of downturns and they're really good from a customer selection standpoint and knowing how to work
with the borrowers. I can't remember if there was another one that you had mentioned, but...

Yeah. The only thing from an activity level is the same order that Pete went out. I mean Mortgage is clearly still
very, very active. You've got less activity, obviously, in TLS and EFS, and then in the auto space. There's not cars
really being made right now. So, clearly, you're seeing a slowdown in the activity out there. But the same order
that Pete described is also what we're seeing on activity.

Got it. And one follow-up on the CRE side of things, not a big book for you guys, but I remember we talked about
this in 2015 and 2016 with regard to the secondary impacts around Energy and CRE. Can you just talk about just
your views of just how that might play through this time in terms of secondary effects and the impact on the
commercial real estate book? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Sure. The commercial real estate book is dominated by a Class A, infill, multifamily construction. It's a really good
product in downturns. It tends to hold up really well and that's why we like it. The areas that we avoid are office,
which is obviously something that's going to get – is getting hit very hard right now.
Got us a little bit of retail, about $500 million of that. But for the most part, very strong developers, low loan to
values. Last time, at least going into a downturn, I think our occupancy rates were in the mid-90s or something
like that. So, it's a pretty strong, but small portfolio.
We do have multifamily in Houston. Houston obviously is going to be ground zero with what's going on in energy.
We do have some history there. In the last downturn, we did not have a single loss in our multifamily portfolio. We
were able to work through that with our borrowers and most of these developers, they're national developers.
They have equity partners with deep pockets. We have 30% to 40% equity in each of the projects. And they're not
going to walk away from these projects given their investment and the fact that we've got a long history with them
of knowing how they handle things in downturn. So, we feel pretty confident about commercial real estate portfolio
as a whole.

Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Gary, we didn't go into that much detail. I think the number that we are very – feel really good about and I
think it's the most important number is the 1.71% coverage. And I think it's going to stand pretty tall relative to our
peers, especially when you consider that banks that have larger consumer books than us are going to – should
have larger reserves because that's – because of CECL. Our consumer book is very small. So, when you
compare apples-to-apples, commercial reserves to commercial reserves, I think our reserves are going to be
amongst the highest in the industry.

Okay. And then just a follow-up on your – you made the comment on the companies that are coming to you to
request deferrals. I forgot the percentage, but a high percentage seemed to be those that didn't necessarily need
them, but were looking at them as insurance. Just to clarify, are you providing deferrals in those scenarios?

Peter W. Guilfoile A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
We have. And if they were to come back to us again, we would have to reevaluate them in 90 days to see if they
really need them. But, yeah, we've been very accommodative this quarter with just the amount of turmoil that's out
there. We just felt it was the right thing to do. And we were happy to accommodate our customers.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A

And, Gary, I just would say – this is Curt – that I would apply that same lens across all of our customers. So,
whether they are a retail consumer or customer or even a private banking wealth management customer or a
commercial customer in any of our commercial channel, we have really tried to be accommodative on the front
end. Because of the great deal of uncertainty and then hopefully customers behave well, which we think they will
through this cycle. And we always address the situations where maybe they are not. But we wanted to be as
flexible and as accommodative because we think it's the right thing to do for the country.

Thanks. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Just a real quick one kind of following up on Ken's questions. You
were talking about economic activity, I'm wondering if you – and really by line of business, can you talk about it by
market. I know that it sounds like Texas is preparing to open back up, Michigan is a bit more restrictive and

California might be somewhere in the middle. But talk about whether or not you think you've seen activity trough
in some of your markets. And what kind of expectations you have in a place like Texas when it opens back up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jon, first of all, obviously, this impact is broad and it's really across all markets in almost all industries, not just
those that are dealing with social distancing sort of disruption. So, there is sort of broad impact, a broad impact on
GDP, broad impact on unemployment from a sort of consumer level, and so all that has to play out.
We do believe – our sort of economic view is that the economy should start to stabilize as we get into third
quarter, assuming that we see some of the trends and the COVID abatement that we're anticipating. And then as
we kind of go through the year, start to see some more normalization and certainly a much stronger sort of pace
to GDP heading into 2021, a lot of that supported by what is just unprecedented massive physical and sort of
monetary stimulus.
Kind of going back to each of the markets, I'll make a couple of comments on all three of them. Texas is a little bit
unique in that it's facing the dual challenge not only of the COVID situation, but of the oversupply of crude oil that
Pete has been talking about. But having said all that, it does seem like Texas got ahead of things early, and at
some point, there seems to be a movement from the governor towards some more normalization and some
selective reopening. So, we'll see how that plays out.
I'd also say just to Texas today, while there's certainly the energy issue, it definitely is a more diverse economy
than it was last – 10 years ago during the Great Recession. And as you know, we've seen just very significant
new job creation and net population inflow. So, Texas will take a blow here from energy and COVID. But I do think
the longer term, it's better positioned than it was during the last Great Recession.
California seems to have gotten a little bit ahead of the quarantine early. There was some recent news out that
maybe the numbers for LA were higher than originally reported. And I would say that in California, we also are
seeing some opportunities. There's always opportunity that get created on the IT side, as people are doing more
automation in technology. And then, lastly, I just would say, as I've said previously, California is a very resilient
economy, very diverse economy, sixth largest economy in the world. And so, I think longer term we'll be okay.
Michigan has more concentration of issues and took a more restrictive quarantine early on to deal with that, to
deal with the COVID impact. I think the state is dealing with some of the impacts of extended plant closures.
Certainly, in the manufacturing sector, we talked about the decline in auto sales as well. And we would expect
auto sales to probably fall again in April, but then maybe start to stabilize in the summer, as hopefully we start to
come out as the people start to move around.
But I'd say the same thing about Michigan. And you look at where the state is today versus where they were 10
years ago, it's definitely moving to a more diverse economy. We've had a tremendous resurgence in the core of
Detroit and we've seen some population inflow, especially in most millennials into the state. And so, every state is
a little bit different situation. Certainly, the reopening will be governed by the governors. And so, we'll have to work
with each state related to that. And we have been working now for a few weeks on our own reopening plan.
But the good news is whether we go back to a full throttle reopening or maybe a phased reopening, it has not
stopped us from doing business. And we have been able to operate well in a more remote environment with some
of our colleagues, about 65% of our colleagues working remotely, and then certainly some who were – banking
centers, et cetera that are still in more direct face-to-face contact with customers.
