President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Justin. Welcome and good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call as we review our fourth
quarter and full year 2022 results, which we released this morning before the market opened. The earnings
release and a company investor presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
It was another exceptional year for Columbia. Our bankers entered 2022 with tremendous momentum on the
heels of a record 2021, and they were successful in capitalizing on opportunities, winning new business, and
providing the necessary capital to allow our customers to grow and expand. We extend our footprint into Utah and
Arizona during the year, all the while nurturing our existing client base in an [ph] interest rate (01:20) environment
unseen in well over a decade.
That weren't enough, teams across the bank were simultaneously involved in integration efforts for our merger
with Umpqua. And during the first quarter of 2022, we completed the core conversion for our Bank of Commerce

Holdings acquisition. Notwithstanding these competing priorities, our bankers delivered outstanding full year
results. Annual net income exceeded $250 million for the first time in our history. Full year EPS expanded by 15%
to a new high, volumes rose by 11% during the year after adjusting for PPP runoff, and our operating efficiency
ratio fell below 50% in the fourth quarter.
Although it took longer than initially expected, on January 9, we announced we had received approval from the
FDIC clearing the last regulatory hurdle for our merger with Umpqua. I'm happy to report that we completed the
first of the branch's divestiture sales this past weekend with the second scheduled in February.
Consequently, we expect the merger with Umpqua to close February 28 and we are still planning for the systems
conversion in March. It's an understatement to say I'm proud to lead such a talented and committed team.
Associates across the company have done an outstanding job over the past 15 months remaining extremely
focused on all of our stakeholders in addition to preparing for our merger with Umpqua. Our bankers focused on
sustaining and growing our normal business activities while simultaneously supporting integration efforts and
conversion planning. I want to thank them for their commitment for rising to the challenge as we work toward
creating one of the premier banking franchises in the Western US.
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer your questions. I need to remind you that we
may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on forward-looking comments,
please refer to either our earnings release or website or SEC filings. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Aaron.

Good morning, everyone. As Clint noted, full year net income of $250 million and EPS of $3.20 were new annual
record. Our performance was a reflection of strong loan growth and rising interest rates, combined with solid fee
income, well-controlled spending, and thoughtfully managed credit. Excluding costs related to be Umpqua
combination and Merchants acquisition of $19.1 million pre-tax pre-provision income was a record $326 million,
exceeding the prior record set in 2021 by $58 million or 22%.
Fourth quarter earnings of $68.9 million and EPS of $0.88 represented a linked quarter increase of $4 million and
$0.05 respectively. Quarterly pre-tax pre-provision earnings increased by $1.9 million to $90.9 million due to
continued expansion of net interest income. The core increase was actually larger, but we had higher sequential
merger costs and recall that we had a non-recurring gain of $3.7 million on a building sale in the third quarter.
The balance sheet funding mix shifted during the quarter and was supported by an increase of $986 million in
short-term borrowings, as deposits declined by $1.2 billion to $16.7 billion. The overall mix of deposits remains
firm and our liquidity position remains very strong, providing us with continued deposit pricing flexibility.
The loan-to-deposit ratio at year-end was 69%, which remains at the low end of the five-year average preceding
the pandemic. Total loans were essentially flat linked quarter after accounting for $76 million of loans moved to
held for sale in preparation for the divestiture and branches as a condition of the Umpqua merger.
Excluding this, new loan, production exceeding $400 million was essentially offset by contractual prepayments â€“
rather contractual payments, along with an uptick in early prepayments and seasonally lower line utilization. Early
repayments were $190 million in the fourth quarter versus $157 million in the third as more borrowers are
choosing to use their liquidity to pay down debt that is repriced to current market rate.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
The investment portfolio decreased $156 million to $6.6 billion as paydowns and maturities were partly offset by
fair value movement related to the available for-sale book. The portfolio was split 31% held to maturity and 69%
available for sale as of year-end. The overall investment securities yield was essentially unchanged at 2.05%,
while the duration decreased slightly to 5.2 years.
Our net interest margin continues to benefit from rising rate, increasing 17 basis points linked quarter to 3.64%,
predominantly driven by higher average loan rate and a stronger earning asset mix. Partly offsetting this, our cost
of deposits rose relatively modest 8 bps to 18 basis points. Our overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities rose 36
basis points to 58 basis points, due mostly to higher FHLB borrowing, though our exceptional deposit base
continues to support a favorable overall cost of fund.
New loan coupons in the fourth quarter were at an average rate of 6.16%, which compares to 3.57% in the fourth
quarter of 2021. Notably, the vast majority of our loans moved above their floors in the latter half of 2022.
Noninterest income decreased $3.3 million linked quarter to $23.3 million. After adjusting for the property sale
gain I noted earlier, however, noninterest income increased by approximately $400,000, mostly due to BOLI gains
of $354,000. We continue to see solid deposit account and treasury management fees, with strengthened
financial services and trust revenue offsetting lower loan revenue due to weakness in mortgage banking activity.
Excluding merger-related expenses in the third and fourth quarter, noninterest expense decreased $0.6 million
sequentially to $95.6 million, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense, and we had good cost
control across the board. Combined with our strong revenue, operating efficiency dropped to 48% for the quarter.
Meanwhile, the effective tax rate remained level at 21%.
Lastly, credit metrics improved during the quarter reflecting continued industry-leading asset quality.
Nonperforming assets decreased slightly, with NPAs at year-end representing just 7 basis points of total asset,
and we recorded net recoveries of $1.2 million. Despite these favorable trends, we recorded a $2.4 million
provision, reflecting a less optimistic economic forecast. As a result, the allowance as a percentage of total loans
rose to 1.36% at year-end compared to 1.32% as of September 30.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris.

Christopher M. Merrywell
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron mentioned, solid loan production of $402 million was in
line with previous fourth quarters and drove full year production to a new post-PPP record of $2.2 billion.
Accordingly, loan growth was tempered by a normal seasonal reduction in line utilization. Loan balances grew to
$11.6 billion, representing an increase of 9% during the year and 11% when adjusted for PPP paydowns.
Production during the quarter was predominantly split between CRE and CNI.
Overall line utilization down 2 basis points during the quarter to 47.5%, but was up from 43.3% a year ago. CRE
remains well-diversified across multiple industries, and is well balanced with 54% income properties and 46%
owner-occupied. We're very proud of our bankers, and our CNI portfolio continues to reflect their disciplined
relationship-based approach. Our quarterly production mix was 49% fixed, 41% floating and 10% variable. The
overall portfolio now stands at 54% fixed, 32% floating and 13% variable. PPP loans are no longer a measurable
part of the portfolio at only $10 million as of year-end. The geographic distribution of our loan portfolio stands at
48%, Washington; 29%, Oregon; 10%, California; 5%, Idaho; with the remaining 7% in other states.

Deposits fell by $1.2 billion during the quarter, and the outflows were due to a variety of factors, including normal
seasonal activity and a reversion of excess client liquidity back towards historical levels. Clients use funds for a
variety of purposes to include year-end bonuses and distributions, paying down debt, making investments, and
moving cash to higher paying alternatives, including approximately $200 million to CB Financial Services during
the quarter, and almost $800 million during the full year, with the majority of that coming in the second half of the
year.
The deposit mix shifted slightly during the quarter, with 59% of our deposits [ph] towards for (11:18) businesses
and 41% from consumers as of year-end. And the ratio of non-interest-bearing demand deposits improved from
49.1% at the end of 2021 to 50.1% at the end of 2022.
On the fee income front, our wealth management group had yet another record year with over $17 million in
revenue. Our retail, commercial and wealth management teams continue to work together in an effort to bank the
entire relationship across our clients' lifecycles.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Clint.

Thanks, Chris. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 was announced this morning. This quarter's dividend will
be paid on February 21 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 6. This concludes our
prepared comments.
As a reminder, Chris and Aaron are with me to answer your questions. And now, Justin, we'll open the call for

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Feaster from Raymond
James. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Kind of like to follow up maybe on the deposit front. And maybe you touched on some of the competitive
dynamics there. I was wondering if you could maybe help quantify maybe some of the surge deposit outflows
versus seasonal dynamics and versus clients utilizing cash to pay down higher cost debt. And then I guess from a
competitive standpoint, are you seeing certain geographies maybe more competitive than you think were through
the surge deposits? And just curious on some comments on that front.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. This is Aaron. I'll start, and let Chris clean up for me. But the â€“ we certainly have seen some revision of
excess client funding kind of revert back toward normal level. I think there's probably still a little bit more of that to
be seen given some of the analysis we've done on that front, but I think if you look overall, through the pandemic,
we saw outsized inflows relative to a lot of our competitors. Even after the outflows that we saw this quarter, we
continue to run ahead of most of our peers. And so, we're still feeling very good about the â€“ what the deposit
flows have been and the mix. And we've just continued â€“ and I think a lot of that just reflects our continued
discipline in terms of pricing. And I can let Chris talk a little bit more about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure thing, Aaron. David, yeah, you mentioned the part about is it more competitive in certain markets, and I
would tell you, all markets are competitive, and it's different competitors in certain markets, but you're seeing lots
of deposit specials, things of that nature. I'm really happy with the team and how they're working with our clients
to find out what the purpose of the funds were, trying not to become interest rate sensitive or rate sensitive when
we don't have to and in utilizing the tools that are available through wealth management and such.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
But the reality is, is there are some pretty significant specials that are out there. We've used our exception pricing
and the discipline around that to keep our costs from going up on that. But there are some folks that have chosen
to pivot into a Treasury bill or CD special or money market special in another bank. But we're not seeing that
we're losing the relationships. We're just seeing a pivot for some â€“ put it more under the hot money category. But
we're really comfortable with the relationships we still have with those client.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
If you look at the composition of noninterest bearing as a percentage of the total, that continue to be very stable.
In fact, it actually ticked up just a little bit sequentially. And just in terms of the loan deposit ratio, if you look back
to where that stood, as I mentioned in my opening comments over the five years preceding the pandemic, it
basically ranged between 70% and 85%, and we're still down at the very bottom end of that, so we still have a lot
of flexibility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely. And if you do see some more of those surge deposits outflow, is FHLB advances the primary
way of funding those versus securities sales or CDs or anything like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. At this point, that would be our preferred source of funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And maybe touching on the growth side and somewhat of a seasonal slowdown in originations. Just
curious how much of that is your appetite for credit diminishing somewhat, just given the economic backdrop
versus demand for credit in the market slowing or competitive dynamics, maybe even fewer attractive deals
coming across the desk? And just curious, where â€“ what segments are still attractive to you and still coming â€“
bringing good risk-adjusted returns at this point in the cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, David, as always, you pack a lot into a question, so feel free to circle back if we don't fully address each
aspect of that. I guess, I'll start off and then hand it over to Chris. So, from an appetite standpoint, we're very
comfortable with all the different verticals that we've historically been in. We're committed to remaining throughout
the cycles to our clients and to our bankers within those verticals. And then, when we look at our pending merger
with Umpqua, there's not any portfolio of concentration issues that get created as a result of that. In fact, it
actually, on a combined basis, gives us more room to run within those verticals that we do have expertise in. I
think the key part of your question though is I'll paraphrase, can we quantify what we stepped away from because
of either underwriting? I don't really call â€“ I guess you could say its competitive dynamics. I think I just call it
people that are still very much focused on putting up loan growth numbers as opposed to really looking at where
7


Columbia Banking System, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
we might be heading from an economy or economic standpoint and then realizing that, all right, the risk return
isn't there. And so, from our perspective, we'd rather pass and protect shareholder value and let somebody else
take that deal. And there was quite a bit of that during the quarter. And I'll let Chris give you the specifics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks. Yeah, David, the dynamics during the quarter of what we were tracking as we saw rates coming in and
what the requests were, it approaches a couple hundred million in deals that we simply looked at and said, it is
not in the shareholders' best interest to put that on the books. And we were seeing rates that, frankly, were below
the 10-year treasury. And it just doesn't seem prudent to put that type of business on at this time.
Now, if there was something that was a relationship or something like that, as we've mentioned in the past, we
certainly will be flexible with that type of pricing. But when you look at some of the new business that we would
normally attract throughout the year, that's where we chose to walk away from those types of deals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That makes sense. And then, last one maybe for me. You guys talked about having the first mock conversion in a
readiness review with upcoming systems conversion. I'm just curious how that went and maybe what you learned
from that. And then, as we think about this whole conversion process, it's kind of a unique opportunity, from the
Integration management office standpoint, they've been looking at this for a long time. Is there anything while
we're going through these opportunities or other investments or upgrades as we go through the conversion and
integration that maybe we can accelerate? Just curious from the conversion standpoint, your thoughts around
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. This is Aaron. Yeah, the mock conversion went very well. Of course, there's always some lessons
learned, and we're figuring out ways we can make sure we do things better. But we're having a tremendous
amount of client communication right now that's going out to make sure that when we do get to the actual
conversion that it goes absolutely smoothly as possible, and we want it to be a seamless experience for the
customer and for our associates as possible. So, we're spending a lot of time there. [indiscernible] (21:10),
obviously, is leading that effort. And as we've gone through this, we've had a principle of not introducing new risks
to any of this process. So, we haven't necessarily been actively looking to build in new products as part of this
process. But certainly, we're continuously looking at the competitive environment and speaking to our clients
about what their needs are and making sure that we are staying ahead of that and anticipating that. And so, there
are things that we'll be looking to do in the year ahead to make sure that all of our treasury management
capabilities continue to be leading edge. But there's nothing that we're trying to implement through the integration
process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The one thing I'll add to that is, we've spent a lot of time over the past 15 months talking about the complementary
nature of Columbia's business activities and Umpqua's business activities. So, we think that there's a lot of
opportunity for upside with existing capabilities between the two organizations. So, for example, our healthcare
book leveraging impacts capabilities. Some of those types of things. Umpqua's got a more sophisticated and
8


Columbia Banking System, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
broader product set on the Treasury management side that existing Columbia customers will instantly get the
benefit of those expanded offerings.
So, I do think that there's plenty of opportunities already existing. And then, to Aaron's point, try to minimize the
number of moving parts to the extent we can at these critical moments of conversion and integration. But with the
conversion scheduled shortly after the close, I think we'll be able to quickly pivot in the back half of the year
towards looking at are there things that have emerged that neither bank has that we think, long term, would give
us an advantage? And so, I think it'll be a quick turn, but I think we're set up very, very well. They want to meet â€“
not only meet the needs, but exceed the needs of most of our customers and continue to grow with them.

Davidson. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to [indiscernible] (24:12) in on the, maybe if I could, the core noninterest expense
and fee income lines. I've got it around [ph] 96 (24:20) in, call it, 2023, 2024. So, one of the first to get those
numbers aligned with what your thoughts are on core, and then if you have any thoughts about how that
transitions outside of seasonal influences, but look at per kind of growth rates for the year. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, those are pretty close. If you want, I can give you the specifics behind the underlying merger cost in
terms of what lines those had, if that's helpful to you. But I think I would echo the comments that Ron made on the
earlier Umpqua call in terms of expectations for first quarter. Typically, you're going to see an uptick in expenses
related to [indiscernible] (25:11) that sort of thing. And then, shortly after that, you get the kind of annual merit
increase impact. But a lot of those seasonal costs hit in the first quarter then trail off through the year. So, I don't
think you're going to see anything outsized or abnormal related to that, of course, with the exception of our two
institutions coming together, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Aaron, expectation of growth in â€“ outside of the â€“ let's just exclude the cost saves, but just standalone Columbia,
are you in kind of a 3%, 4% or 5% kind of growth for 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We're probably â€“ I would say, 2% to 3% is probably more in the range of what I'd be thinking.

Okay. Got you. Okay. And then, I guess, similarly looking at growth, loan growth that is, and understood on some
of the puts and takes competitively and within customer movement, your own appetite. Also, if you layer in, I don't
know if you've got visibility on payoffs or paydowns, but kind of where your budget on a 2023 growth expectation
for Columbia standalone?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, this is Chris. I think the visibility to it, there's always payoffs, paydowns, there's normal amortization, et
cetera. And I just put it into kind of normal course of business right now with the interest rate environment where it
is, your unforeseen payoffs are less likely. You may still see some business sales or some things like that, but
we're pretty comfortable where we are on it. I would look at, overall, you're in a low to mid-single digits. I don't
know that I would go much over 5% on that as far as the mid. But you're in that space kind of with the market
dynamics where they're at and what we're looking at, but again, our bankers are seeing lots of opportunities, and
it's just a matter of which ones make the most sense to put onto the balance sheet. But low to mid-single digits is,
I think, a comfortable spot to be.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I don't know if you'll answer this one, but I'll give it a shot. On slide 30 of your presentation, the last bullet
shows core expense run rate communicated. And if you go back to your original deck, you talked about $135
million of full run rate savings with two-thirds of it in 2023. How do you want us to think about the timing of the cost
saves, given that your system's conversion is going to occur at the same time than you originally planned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it's a great question. Just given the passage of time, with the protracted approval, we've identified
the $435 million, typically, the timing of when those are realized is some immediately at close, and then usually
10


Columbia Banking System, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
there's another wave of those somewhere between 30 days and 60 days post systems conversion and
integration. So, we're shooting for a clean run rate for fourth quarter of 2023. So, we would expect that all [ph]
$135 million (29:25) is fully implemented sometime within the third quarter. Kind of how that flows between first
quarter, second quarter, I don't have that in front of me. I don't know if Aaron does specifically. What I will say is
that we've had â€“ some of that has actually been realized just as some of the attrition that we've had from a
employee standpoint were centered in positions that we're not go-forward. And so, there's a little bit of that that's
already in the run rate, I'd say. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Aaron.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, I just think â€“ I mean, the thing that's changed is maybe the order of the timing of when various saves are
realized. But in terms of the end date of when we expect to hit a good run rate, as Clint said, that expectation of
hitting that by year-end remains.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's actually very helpful and what I was looking for. And just a follow-up on the margin question.
Actually, it's kind of impressive when you see your earning asset yields up like they were, but your interest-
bearing liability cost were up about the same amount and that's outperformed most of the other banks that I've
seen. Just philosophically, when you think about those â€“ the direction of those two interest-earning asset yields
and interest rate and liability costs, is there more pressure on the liability side at this point, or do you feel like you
can kind of keep pace with asset yield expansion that maybe matches or exceeded liability cost expansion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's a good question because the â€“ you are seeing an acceleration here through the year on the liability side, but I
think if you look at where the new asset yields are coming on, and then continue to see a little bit of a mix shift as
we utilize this cash flows coming off the investment securities portfolio, I think we should see them at least be
matched if we're not seeing continued expansion overall between the two.

Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess one more follow-up. You may have kind of answered it before Chris
or Clint, but any of the big picture themes that you laid out when the merger was announced? Have they changed
at all, in your mind, positive or negative? And in terms of the revenue synergies, I know you don't really want to
lay them out at this point, but any other opportunities that you've found as you've kind of played this waiting game
for approval? Thanks.

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So big picture, the world is completely different than what it was when we announced this thing [ph] geez (32:42)
what, 16 months ago almost. But in terms of what our expectations were and what we thought that we would
achieve on a combined basis or be able to achieve on combined basis, nothing has changed there. In fact, just
with the passage of time, probably more firmly entrenched in our beliefs that we're going to be able to capture
those revenue synergies.

I think we did a fairly robust analysis of some of these things through the diligence process. But then as you start
to truly understand the depth of talent that Umpqua Bank has in some of these areas that would be additive to
Columbia standalone revenue streams, it's hard not to get excited waiting for March 1 so we can hit the ground
running. So there's nothing that we expected that we now today are thinking that we won't be able to accomplish
together.
I'll step back and see if Chris has anything he wants to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think that fees around now having a firm date, sticking with our conversion is gone. Honestly, it's what
we've learned over all this time about the expanded capabilities and what our bankers are going to be able to take
to market. They now have that point in time where they know what's coming and then we can get right back out
there and get to taking advantage of those capabilities.
So, big picture, I don't think things have changed, but I think there's been a little bit more excitement created
because of the length of time. And only because we now have a finish line to it that it will be off and working on
that aspect of it. But yeah, the world has changed. Rates are obviously different. Mortgage markets are different,
things of that nature. But our bankers are still out there looking and prospecting. And then now that with that finish
line in sight, I think it's really exciting, actually.

Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Chris McGratty
from KBW. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Just a question on credit. Obviously, you guys have unbelievable credit numbers. One of the
conversations that taken a lot of our time as analyst recently is this office. So, I was hoping you could â€“ you speak
to the kind of your thoughts on that portfolio. It looks like it's about 10%, 11%. Maybe some characteristics, the
underwriting statistics, anything you're particularly concerned about, that'd be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, good morning, Chris. I'll start and we'll take maybe a team approach to answering your question here. I'll
start by saying our metrics you saw on the release continue to remain pristine. I think this is the first â€“ probably
the first earnings call in 18-plus years that Andy McDonald hasn't been on. Andy's [indiscernible] (36:30) some
place in Idaho right now. So, I think that in itself is a testament to how we're thinking about credit, specific to the
office space.

Some of the â€“ a lot of the kind of urban core downtown-type office buildings, that's not really â€“ it's not really the
type of things that we have in our portfolio. And so, I think there's a little bit of a significant difference between
what you're seeing in, let's say downtown Seattle, in Portland, and some of the other areas that we're in from a
occupancy standpoint. But with that, I'll pass it over to Chris and he can give you some more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. Chris, what you've mentioned in our underwriting things of that nature, it hasn't changed. I mean, we've
always been fairly conservative by nature. We've talked about that in the past. What's changed is when you look
at the portfolio and you stress test it towards higher rates, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing there in
the credit side. And [ph] anything due (37:50) that's coming on to stress for even higher rate. So when you look at
the ability of the borrower to withstand, potentially, if rates were to go up further, values were to come down.
We're working on lower to loan values overall, certainly, in the portfolio. Never been a max proceeds lender on
anything new, and again, stressing the portfolio to those higher rates. We're not seeing anything, and as Clint
mentioned, we're not really in the markets where you're seeing the headlines of businesses pulling out, turning
back office space, and things of that nature. That's really not our niche.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. Aside from office, I mean, the wall of worry is high, I guess, broadly on the economy.
Where else would you be spending more time just stress testing within your portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, actually, everything that's stress test suggested. Not seeing any â€“ I mean, there's not any really early
warning signs that we're seeing. I think from conversations with Andy, there's an eye being kept on it when we do
our provision with Aaron, and certainly looking at economic indicators and the unemployment and things of that
nature. But I guess you would say we're keeping an eye on what may happen with some of these large
companies and doing some downsizing and some layoffs. But again, when you hear some of those numbers,
these are companies that are not only across many states, but they're multinational. And so, it doesn't mean it's
all affecting an area right down the street from us. But we are looking at those types of things. Haven't seen
anything that's popped up yet in any reviews or any of our testing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The other thing I'll add is it really comes down to our bankers being proactive in managing their portfolios. We talk
a lot, and a lot of banks probably do this, talk about relationships. But that's really the value of having a
relationship is that there's ongoing two-way communication so that you're operating under the premise of no
surprises. And that's part of that is if we through that process has served us well for the 30 years that we've been
in business. You find a borrower that maybe isn't as â€“ or provider isn't as [indiscernible] (40:28) what you would
think. Well then, those are the types that we'd prune out just on an ongoing basis and trying to make sure that we
have the best clients possible or the best portfolio within each vertical possible that we can.
And so, one area I'll mention just specifically would be our [indiscernible] (40:56) banking area. That's something
that as part of our ongoing management, it was early 2021 that really started communicating with each of their
13


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2023
clients about what's your plan if rates go up, what does it look like, how's your inventory going to hold up, what's
your strategy for projects. And as a result, those portfolios are performing very well. There's probably was a little
bit of earning that occurred in late 2021, early 2022 as a result of those conversations. But the vast majority of
those relationships are intact and part of the great metrics that you see.
It also leads into other things that you see in the balance sheet. Now, these are smaller portions of that dynamic.
But for example, our builders are putting more of their own money into the projects. So that lowers their deposit
balances, lowers their line utilization. There's different things that kind of come into play that you can be at a
macro level if you look at our financials.

Hi, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe just a start, Aaron, on the FHLB borrowings this quarter, were all the FHLBs added, were they overnight
funding or were there any term to the borrowings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's all very short term. So, a fair bit of overnight, but it's weeks, not months or years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just bigger picture if I think about the balance sheet on a pro forma basis throughout
the year, you will have marked the securities portfolio as the deal closed. So that's reflected in pro forma capital.
Do you feel like that gives you maybe philosophically just greater flexibility to roll or sell a greater portion of the
bond book, either to fund loan growth or maybe reduce the borrowing position throughout the year?

Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean [ph] once marked (43:41) obviously that arguably gives you more flexibility, that doesn't mean that's
going to be the decision. And obviously, those cash flows on those parks come back and supports capital levels.
But I mean that's going to be a decision dependent upon what the rate environment is and what the balance sheet
trends are going forward. So â€“ and so I'm not going to presume just what that's going to be just yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Andrew, the one thing I'll add there and you were on the Umpqua call just before this, and I think Ron [ph] fielded
(44:18) a similar question. We're not going to give our playbook out because there's a lot of folks besides just our
investors that listen to this call or listen to the playback of it. But it does present an opportunity for us to start
thinking about just how we manage downside risk, the falling rate over the intermediate term. And Ron and myself
and the rest of the go-forward executive team have started having those conversations. And so, we're not going to
say anything about what exactly the details are. But we do have flexibility and I think more flexibility than most of
the banks in our group will have to put some protection on the balance sheet for falling rates and that's a big part
of that â€“ component of that strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Very good. I appreciate the color and the rest of mine were asked and addressed already. So, thanks.

Operator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Matthew
Clark from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. First of all, just on the â€“ your updated thoughts around your pro
forma deposit beta through the cycle. I think in the deck, you guys show 28% seemed to be your base case. Is
that kind of what you're managing to as Umpqua comes onboard and â€“ with only a couple more rate hikes
allegedly from the Fed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. I mean, it's â€“ we're â€“ I wouldn't say we're managing to [indiscernible] (46:20) per se. Obviously, you've seen
our deposit costs start to come up here in the last quarter of the year, but the â€“ but it's a date through the cycle.
Our deposit beta on interest bearing is only 9 basis points. So, overall, it's about half of that 9%.
So, that's going to continue to rise. Whether or not that exceeds what we saw in the last cycle is to be determined.
I think there's a decent expectation that it's a bit higher than that, just given the rate rising pace has been more
aggressive and longer lasting. So, there's going to be more follow-through than what we saw during the last cycle.

But what that ultimately is, is going to depend on what we see in terms of just deposit flows, loan demand, and as
Clint kind of alluded to in the prior question about what we might do with the balance sheet overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Okay. And then if you had this spot rate on interest-bearing deposits or total deposits at the end of the year
and the average NIM in the month of December.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. I'll follow up with you on the monthly. Maybe just last one around M&A, I know you guys have a lot on your
plate with the integration with Umpqua. But what are your general thoughts around additional kind of M&A to the
extent something comes available that's high quality in Northern California?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, our highest priority is getting to February 28 and getting our merger close, and then assimilating the two
companies. And we're both very experienced at that. And I think the work that we've done, we haven't let the
protracted closing process go to waste. We've got a clearly defined combined culture. We've put a few thousand
of our associates from both companies through training on that. So I think that the process of, what I'll say, the
systems piece that's all scheduled, I think social aspect of integrating to large companies is well underway and
has been for quite some time. And so, as we emerge from the back half or into the back half of â€“ approach the
end of 2023, that's where we'll refine our combined strategy and strategic plan in terms of what we â€“ will be our
primary focus over the next two to five years.
M&A, I envision will be a part of that. The challenge frankly that we'll have is at $50-plus billion and with the
growth capabilities â€“ organic growth capabilities that we have today. I mean, if you look at what the two banks
have done in the midst of all this uncertainty around them, the closing would be, the expansion in de novo
markets, the production that those teams have had, there's, I would say, a short list of quality franchises that
would meet our hurdle from an M&A perspective.
But we have more work to do on that. We have to get the work at hand done first and then we'll turn our focus to
what targets might be a good fit for us and make a meaningful difference in terms of the size of the combined
organization.
