Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
I'll begin on slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.97 which included $0.01
per share of notable item related to the FDIC special assessment. Excluding this one-time charge, we delivered
earnings per share of $0.98. This quarter was highlighted by an increase in net interest income, continued fee
income growth, prudent expense management, credit quality stabilization, and strong capital accretion. Notably,
our return on tangible common equity increased to 18.6% on an adjusted basis.
Turning to slide 4, revenue growth for the quarter was supported by improved spread income as well as continued
growth across many of our fee-based businesses. On both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, noninterest
expense as adjusted was down, benefiting from cross-synergies with Union Bank, prudent expense management,
and multiyear investments across the business that have resulted in greater efficiencies and enhanced operating
effectiveness.
As I mentioned earlier, credit quality results were in line with our expectations as we saw stabilization in
delinquency rates and a modest increase in NPAs. Average total deposits increased 2.2% and we continued to
see growth in consumer deposits despite industry and liquidity headwinds.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
As of June 30, our tangible book value per share increased to $23.15 or 2.8% better than last quarter and 10.1%
higher than last year. Our CET1 capital ratio increased 30 basis points from the prior quarter and 120 basis points
from last year to end the quarter at 10.3%. John will discuss some key takeaways from this year's stress test in
his opening remarks.
Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets increased to
0.98% and return on average common equity improved to 12.6%. Our efficiency ratio also improved from the first
quarter to 60.7% on an adjusted basis.
Turning to slide 6, fee income represents just over 40% of total net revenue and benefited this quarter from high
seasonal revenues across each of our payment businesses, strong core growth in trust and investment
management fees as well as improved treasury management revenue. Overall, diversified fee income businesses
continue to operate at scale and provide earnings consistency through the cycle.
And most importantly, we are encouraged by the progress we're making to deepen our most profitable client
relationships, expand our product set, and enhance our distribution channels. These efforts are positioning us well
for continued growth and strategic differentiation.
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy.
If you turn to slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet summary, followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings
friends.
Total average deposits increased $10.8 billion or 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis to $514 billion, driven by stable
institutional deposit balances and continued consumer balance growth. Average noninterest bearing deposits
decreased $1.4 billion or 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis as we continue to emphasize stickier, relationship-based
deposit generation. The pace of decline in noninterest-bearing balances continued to slow this quarter. As the
chart in the upper left shows, we are prudently managing our pricing as we remained focused on retaining and
growing core operational relationships across the franchise.
Average total loans were $375 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1.0% linked quarter. The increase was driven
by higher credit card loans from higher spend volumes and increased commercial loans from growth in corporate
banking. Loan growth this quarter was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and total other retail loans.
With elevated deposit levels, we opportunistically increased the size of our investment securities portfolio, with
short-dated high-quality securities to better optimize cash levels. As a result, the ending balance on our
investment portfolio was $168 billion as of June 30. Actions taken on the investment portfolio this quarter,
together with approximately $3 billion of securities runoff, resulted in an average yield increase to 3.15%, a 19-
basis-point increase from the prior quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Going forward, we would expect the balance on the investment portfolio to remain relatively flat to the current
level and for the reinvestment benefit from quarterly securities runoff to be approximately 6 basis points to 8 basis
points on average based on current rates.
Slide 8 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with
expectations and we remain appropriately reserved for potential adverse economic conditions. In the second
quarter, delinquencies were flat sequentially. Nonperforming assets increased approximately 3.7% linked quarter,
reflecting a slower pace of change. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 49 basis
points at June 30, compared with 48 basis points at March 31 and 29 basis points a year ago.
Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 58 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter, in line
with our expectations, and we continue to expect our net charge-off ratio to approach 60 basis points in the
second half of this year. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period-end
loans.
Slide 9 provides a more detailed earnings summary. In the second quarter, we reported $0.97 per diluted share,
which included $0.01 per share or a $26 million charge for an increase in the FDIC special assessment following
last year's bank failures.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.05 billion, an
increase of 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in net interest income this quarter was driven by a
combination of deposit volume growth, pricing stabilization and slower migration, as well as fixed asset repricing,
improved loan mix, and other actions taken on the investment portfolio to optimize cash balances. Elevated
deposit levels and higher on-balance sheet liquidity drove a 3-basis-point decline in net interest margin this
quarter to 2.67%.
Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income. Fee income increased $115 million or 4.3% on a linked-quarter
basis, driven by seasonally higher payments revenue and stronger mortgage banking fees, which included an
approximate $30 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. This increase was partially offset by a slight
decrease in commercial product revenue due to lower corporate bond fees and losses on the investment
securities sales of $36 million. Noninterest income through the first six months of the year increased 5.4% on a
year-over-year basis as we continue to benefit from deepening client relationships across our fee businesses.
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense, as adjusted, decreased $6 million or 0.1% on a linked-quarter basis.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefit expense, which was partially
offset by higher net occupancy and equipment, as well as marketing and business development costs. Year-over-
year, noninterest expense, as adjusted, decreased $71 million or 1.7% as we prudently managed expenses,
identified operational efficiencies across the business, and realized synergies from the Union Bank acquisition.
Turning to slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3% as of June 30 was reflective of a 30-basis-point
increase from the first quarter and a 120-basis-point improvement compared to last year. On June 26, the Federal
Reserve released its 2024 stress test results. Consistent with the industry, the Fed's modeled results were largely
reflective of an assumption taken to significantly lower fee income and increase provision expense in stress,
which resulted in a 60-basis-point increase to our preliminary stress capital buffer of 3.1%. We remain well
capitalized and prepared to manage any potential industry stress that might result from a severe macroeconomic
downturn.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
I will now provide forward-looking guidance on slide 14, which is consistent with our previous guidance. We
expect net interest income for the third quarter on an FTE basis to be relatively stable to the second quarter. Full-
year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is expected to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. For
the full year, we expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth in noninterest income, as adjusted. We continue to
expect full-year noninterest expense, as adjusted, of $16.8 billion or lower.
Let me now turn it back to Andy for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John.
I'll finish up on slide 15. Second quarter results highlighted the resiliency of a business model that features a
highly diversified revenue mix, strong risk management discipline, and a robust earnings and capital generation
profile. We remain focused on our core competencies and are aggressively building upon our key differentiators.
The investments we're making across the businesses are showing through in the form of enhanced customer
acquisition, improved client experiences, and deeper relationships that are further propelling our growth story.
Expense management is a key priority for us, and we remained focused on our target of positive operating
leverage in the second half of this year and beyond.
Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue to build upon our solid foundation and already established
interconnectedness across the business, with the scale, reach and product capabilities that'll allow us to deliver
industry-leading returns well into the future.
Let me close by thanking our employees for everything they do to make us the destination of choice for many
clients, communities and shareholders we serve.
We'll now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
John – hey. John, I was hoping you could please sort of discuss the puts and takes within the NII trajectory from
here. Looks like we would hopefully get a bump in the fourth quarter after a stable third quarter if we'd sort of
assume the midpoint of the full-year range. I guess, maybe just a thought or two on factors that would cause you
to come in either toward the high end or the low end of the full-year range, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Scott. Good morning. We're, first of all, we're pleased to see our net interest income grow and we like the
actions that we've taken to position ourselves for the future. Deposit rotation and rates paid have stabilized. Loan
mix has improved. Our fixed assets – earning asset repricing continues to march on and we've been
opportunistically working with the investment portfolio to deploy excess liquidity. So, if you think about some of
these things going forward, the higher and lower end of the range, I'd cite a couple different things.
First of all, I would just say, as I mentioned, we expect stable third quarter net interest income and then from there
we do expect growth. We would anticipate that the pluses and minuses is going to be depending upon deposit
rotation and beta. We do expect some level of rotation out of deposits going forward, but it's going to be relatively
modest and, as you can tell, slowed.
In terms of rate paid, that's going to be dependent on the market, but as you can tell, that has slowed as well and
we feel good about our positioning for rate cuts as we move forward should they occur. Our earning assets, we
know, are going to be formulaic and continue to reprice, whether that's the investment portfolio or the mortgage
book, we expect kind of in that 6 basis point to 8 basis point range on average given current levels.
And then loan growth, we assume, to be very modest in our forecast kind of going forward just kind of given the
loan dynamics that we're seeing. And then finally, I would just say, although it's not as going to be meaningful for
2024 is just the actions of the Fed and what they do, whether they cut or not. So, those are the puts and takes as
we think about the next couple quarters.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you, John. And then maybe if I could ask you to delve a little more deeply into one portion of
that. Just you noted modest loan growth here going forward. What are you all seeing in terms of commercial loan
demand? I guess, I sort of ask within the backdrop of modest outlook, but your average commercial loan growth
this quarter looked a little more favorable than what we've seen from peers. So, just curious as to sort of the
inside baseline on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, I think on loan growth, we did see pockets of loan growth occur in the corporate loan book. But I think
our overall thesis really hasn't changed over the last several quarters. The loan growth environment remains
tepid. It remains – there's caution in the clients, but there's a lot of interest rate movement. And I'm sure that could
spark some things, but overall, it's still a very tepid market and we just happened to find good – some pockets of
growth on the corporate loan book this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Just wondering, John, just following up on the NII. My math, like your fourth quarter could be as high as $4.3
billion. So, appreciate the puts and takes you provided earlier. As we think about the NII trajectory from here, in a
rate cut scenario, just remind us in terms of the positioning of the balance sheet, what four to six rate cuts would
imply, and flex on the deposit side given sort of your sort of corporate institutional makeup.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Sure. Thanks, Ebrahim. So, the way I think about potential rate cut shift and change in market there is that we are
well positioned given the mix of our deposit base. So, approximately 50% of our balances are retail-based and
about 50% of our balances are institutional or corporate type balances. And in a cut environment, those
institutional corporate balances, the beta, if you will, of those, are going to go down as quickly as they came up.
So, we feel very good about the repositioning of that. On the retail side, I would just say that there will always be
some arc to the retail. So, there will be probably some repricing that occurs at the SOFR higher levels. But over
time, those balances will come down.
And so, overall, it gives us an advantage as the curve in theory should start to steepen and you have a lower
short-term rate and a higher, longer term rate that allows for continued earning asset favorability on the repricing
side of things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just separately, when you think about the outlook for the back half on fee revenue growth, the
mid-single digits, where do you think fee revenue growth is going to be driven? What categories are going to drive
that growth? Where do you expect some more moderation relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. I think on the fee side of things, we had a solid quarter, but we continue to expect momentum in the various
categories and it's going to be a combination of all the main ones. It's going to be payments, it's going to be our
trust and investment management fees and it's going to be in the capital market space is probably the three areas
that I would point you to.
On the payment side of things, we continue to see strong core competencies, whether in merchant processing,
you're talking about our tech-led areas. If you're talking about our corporate payments side of things, you're
looking at us starting to lap some of the things in freight and fleet and in credit, credit card, we continue to see
strong spend levels. So, those are all going to be positive things for us as we move forward.
The trust and investment management fees as well as the capital markets continue to see very strong market
backdrop and we have been doing very well in terms of investment in those businesses and as well as just
utilizing our client base and deepening relationships there in a number of different facets and then those are going
to be kind of the tailwinds that we see that position us well for continuing our guidance here in terms of mid-single-
digit growth for fees.

Hi. Good morning.

Hi, good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I know we already talked a little bit about the loan growth piece, but going through the slide deck, you highlighted
that there's utilization rate increase. So, I guess I'm just wondering, and it's important, right, because at least
you're the first institution I've seen this quarter that's had a utilization increase. Do you think that's a function of the
types of industries where you're seeing utilization increase or is that more your new geographies where perhaps
more focused attention on new clients is driving that? Would just like [ph] clarity on that (00:20:21).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, Betsy. So, in terms of utilization, it did tick up. I would say it's pretty modest and I would say it's
pretty much in line with where we've seen in the past. I wouldn't point to it as some new trend that we're going to
see continued utilization – investment or increase. I think it's really more of a function of the loan mix that we saw
this quarter. Some of the loans that were brought on came at a high utilization level versus some of the things that
rolled off. So, I just think it's more of a mix shift rather than a change in trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just on the credit outlook here, I got a sense that maybe there was a little bit more credit
coming through towards the back half of the year. Is that right or did I get that wrong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, I don't think our – well, first of all, our guidance really hasn't changed from a credit standpoint. It continues to
be – it's stabilizing, it's as expected. From a net charge-off perspective, we came in at 58 basis points. We would
anticipate approaching 60 basis points here in the back half of the year is kind of how we're thinking about the
charge-off. But things like delinquencies and non-performing, those metrics have come in, have stabilized, and
have come in very nicely, giving us confidence in our credit outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Yeah. We feel very much appropriately reserved for the book that we have. We saw a little bit of increase in our
reserve build this quarter just simply because of growth, particularly in cards and things of the like. So, that's kind
of what has been the driver on the reserve side.

Hi. Good morning.

John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question – morning. First question is for you, Andy. I think what was really striking about this quarter is
that the balance sheet growth was impressive on both sides of the sheet and really outperforming peers. At the
same time, I think we were all surprised by the stress test results, especially given we thought that the PPNR
dynamics, with MUFG fully baked in, would be a little bit cleaner.
And so, if I'm calculating this right, your adjusted CET1 would be 8% this quarter versus 7.6%. And I'm wondering
as we think about balancing those dynamics, how are you thinking about managing growth relative to this sort of
changing unpredictable element of the SCB? Plus obviously you haven't done a great job at managing risk-
weighted assets last year and obviously, there's a burn-off rate to the AOCI. At the same time, rates are staying a
little bit higher for longer and there's a huge debate on what's going to happen to the belly of the curve even as
everyone scribes to Fed cuts. So, I'm wondering how we should think about balance sheet management from
here, especially in light of the good growth that you experienced this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, Erika, and let me start on the CCAR results. So, as you think about MUFG, the component that we
were focused on there that did happen was the expense component that came down. So, that was as expected.
The component that went up versus the Fed last year was the fee income component and we don't have a lot of
clarity or transparency into why that happened, it happened for a number of banks, and it happened in spite of the
fact that our fee growth is actually even positive. So, that was the part that was the driver of the increased SCB for
us and for a number of other banks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Let me take a step back and let me talk about capital and the balance sheet overall. As we've talked about in the
past, Erika, our priorities from a capital distribution standpoint haven't changed. First is investing in the business,
second is dividends, and third is buybacks. And so, as a part of this year's stress test, as we've talked about, our
planned capital distribution assumed an increase to the quarterly dividend of about 2% starting in the fourth
quarter. And as you saw and as you referenced, our CET1 ratio was 10.3% this quarter. So, we continue to have
strong capital accretion each quarter.
We expect to be well above our fully loaded Cat II capital targets well before we will cross that threshold. So, from
a capital standpoint, we're comfortable with our levels and our ability to accrete 20 basis points to 25 basis points
a quarter.
So, the one open item, as you all know, is the final Basel III Endgame rules. And while we prefer to have those
clarified before revising our capital and distribution targets, we will assess whatever information we have available
and update on our capital distribution, our targets, as well as our return targets at Investor Day on September 12.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, Andy, just as my follow-up, based on what you've just told us, it doesn't seem as if as we think about the rest
of 2024 and the CCAR years of 2024, October 1, 2024 till September 30 of next year, it doesn't sound like we
should expect a similar active balance sheet management in terms of growth as we saw in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, as we've talked about, I think most of the capital accretion going forward, Erika, will be through normal
earnings accretion. And as we talked about, we expect that to be 20 basis points to 25 basis points. We had a
little bit of a benefit this quarter from additional RWA optimization, but going forward, I would think about that 20
basis points to 25 basis points a quarter.

Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you to dig in a little bit on the payments business. Obviously, the
sequential math worked as normal, but the year-over-year growth looked like it slowed from 4% in the first quarter
to 3% in the second. I know we have some easier comps coming up in the second half. But can you just kind of

help us understand just the absolute trajectory within the three business areas and how do you expect that kind of
growth rate to go aside from just comps. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, thanks, Ken. And I do agree, I think, we do expect momentum. Part of that is comps, but we're not
obviously relying on that. If I kind of think about the different businesses here, maybe I'll just start with merchant
processing. We have seen very good core growth in our tech-led initiative. That's about a third of our sales now
and has been growing at a very strong rate. The margins on that business have – we are seeing nice expansion
there. And a lot of our non-travel categories are really seeing very good growth. So, those are kind of the
tailwinds.
We have seen some headwinds this quarter, particularly on travel volumes in Europe, but that is something that
we hope that will reverse and things of that nature. But otherwise, we feel like we're positioned well on the
merchant side of things.
On the retail card side, credit card spend is strong and constructive. I would say, the Union Bank client
acquisition, we're continuing to increase the penetration rate there. But we did see a little bit of a decrease as well
just because of risk mitigation around prepaid card, which may pressure this quarter, but may linger into a couple
quarters as we move forward. But still, we think that the strong growth on the retail side of things is going to
continue to be very helpful.
And then on the corporate side of things, we are starting to get into that inflection point of lapping freight and fleet
and all those sorts of things, as well as our bank card is really performing quite well. And so, I think, those are
really some of the things, I think, especially on corporate payments, by lapping that fleet kind of in the third quarter
or so is going to allow for very strong rates as we think about the fourth quarter. So, at a high level, we just think
that there's momentum on the side of things that will allow us to grow and grow nicely.

Great. Thank you. One more follow-up on NII. You had a really good second quarter result, but the outlook for the
third quarter is stable, and that's with an extra day. And I'm just wondering, can you just work us through, like,
what's the holdback in terms of NII not just growing from here, was there either some things that helped in the
second that don't recur? Looked like your securities yields were a lot higher as one example, but I'm not sure if
that would have been it. So, like, why don't we just see the growth straight up from that 40 to 50 zone we just saw
on the second quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Well, I think it just comes down to the question earlier that is really around the range of outcomes that –
what's going to drive it, and it's really going to be around the deposit behavior and thing. Now, we saw very good
trends in terms of rotation out of DDA. That pace has certainly slowed. We continue to expect it to slow moving
forward, but it doesn't mean it's over, right? And so, there's that component.
On the rate paid side of things, we're just monitoring just how the competitiveness of the deposit rates will go and
quite frankly, we don't expect a lot of deposit growth in the next quarter just simply because QT is still around and
is still putting pressure on industry liquidity for us and for the market and so that's the primary driver is just kind of

the watch of that. And then on top of that, we just don't know if the Fed will cut or not. I know the market has
priced that in, but that's another factor in this sort of thing. So, those would be the factors I would call out.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I just think my math is wrong here. You can help me out with that. Again, even assuming the four items you
just mentioned for NII not going higher in the third quarter, if you could just highlight your fixed asset repricing a
little bit more. Here's my math and it's clearly wrong because, one, you said securities should reprice up 6 basis
points to 8 basis points per quarter, if I heard that correctly.
So, if you take 7 basis points on $168 billion of security, that would be like $100 million extra next quarter. If you
take your mortgage book of $117 billion and you take 7 basis points on that, I wasn't sure if you meant 7 basis
points on that, but then you get us to almost $200 million more for NII on a base of $4 billion, that would be 5%
growth next quarter, 5% growth the quarter after that, et cetera, et cetera, and that's not your guidance.
So, first, if you can just fix my math as far as the fixed asset repricing on the securities and mortgages, what I'm
doing wrong, and then confirm or not those four items that you mentioned to offset all of that? Thank you.

John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Mike. Good to have you too. So, I think in terms of the math or in terms of mortgage, that's going to
continue given that's very much a fixed rate book. On the investment portfolio, given current rates, we would
expect 6 basis point to 8 basis point increase. However, we assume in our projections that we just mentioned that
there will be a cut in September and about half of our book is floating rate or swap to floating and that sort of thing
and so that will impact the investment portfolio that way.
And the deposits, of course, on the other side of that will start to shift. Of course, the institutional side would start
to move right away, but the retail side will have an arc to it. And so, the movement of the cut within the quarter,
which is sort of a part of why we anticipate a relatively stable third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just for clarification, you did intend – the mortgage book should reprice upward by 7 basis points in the
quarter also, same as the securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. That's right. Mortgage book is kind of in that 6 basis point to 8 basis point range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then one more follow-up and I'll re-queue. Your noninterest bearing deposits, you mentioned that as one of
the risk factors. You said it's slowing. Can you remind us what it did between the second and first quarter and
what's your all-time low for that ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
On the mix of DDA to total deposits is, I think 16.2% or so is where we came in this quarter, it was 16.9% a
quarter ago. It was 18% or so the quarter before that. So, that pace is changing and slowing. And in terms of
where it goes, it's going to be just how clients behave and all that sort of thing. But it is an all-time low for us for
sure as we look back at our data.

And Mike, on slide 7, there's a chart, upper left, that shows the migration out, that has slowed. It was 7.1% in the

Hi, Andy. Hi, John.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, Gerald.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John, you talked about the deposits and how you would approach them as the Fed starts to cut rates. I thought it
was interesting in your supplement on the average balance sheet that your largest deposit category, if I'm seeing
it correctly, money market savings, the yield was down from the prior quarter at 3.85% versus 3.92% in the March
quarter. Can you share with us what kind of strategies you used or what took that down when many of the other
rates, like time deposits obviously went up in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Gerard. No problem. So if you look at that category, it's, as you mentioned, our largest category for
deposits. So, it's a mix of wholesale as well as retail and small business and all that sort of thing. And I think what
we have done is, in light of loan growth, obviously it grew a little bit. But it's not – again, it's not growing
tremendously. And so, we had the opportunity to look at our relationships across the bank and price things in an
appropriate manner, that makes sense for us to do.
And so, we've taken some opportunities to exit some high cost deposits and we've really utilized our distribution
network, whether that's on the retail side, the branch network, our app capabilities, really taking advantage – and
our partnerships, really taking advantage of our national bank reach, and really growing in deposits in areas that
have a lower cost. And so, that's kind of the positive rotation that you're seeing in that specific category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I got it. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when the Fed starts to cut rates, from this line item at least,
you guys could potentially benefit from lower rates and the balances continue to grow, which obviously would be
beneficial. Andy, just a more bigger, macro question. John touched a little bit a moment ago about the utilization
rate on the C&I loans. Can you share with us when you guys go out and talk to clients, commercial clients, that is,
what are they thinking about CapEx spending, which would enable them to draw down lines? And then second,
are you seeing any increased competition from alternative lenders, whether it's private credit or other that may be
affecting the C&I loan growth?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Gerard. I think our clients are probably a little bit more focused on defense than offense right now. We just
did a CEO survey and we talk to clients. They are focused on productivity efficiency, expense management and in
the investments that they're making to the extent that they're utilizing lending activity is to really amplify some of
that efficiency opportunity that they're focused on. So, a little bit more on defense. But as John mentioned,
utilization rates were up modestly in pockets across the board and I would expect that to continue as we go
forward. So, nothing significantly different from what we saw in prior quarters. The competition is strong. So, both
bank and nonbank competition that's driving pricing a little bit, we're continuing to seek full relationships with
appropriate returns and that will drive the volumes as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And just as a quick follow-up on the competition, are you guys seeing more aggressive underwriting for banks that
want to grow that balance sheet? How are you seeing that from the underwriting standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Not sure that the underwriting is changing significantly as opposed to pricing, Gerard. That's how I would
focus on it.

Wanted to circle back on payments. A lot of good detail kind of by segment, but was wondering if you could
update your thoughts on the growth you expect for full year this year and then just still it might be a little bit lower
than what you were thinking before and then just the medium-term outlook, if that's still the same.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I'll answer your second question first. The medium term outlook has not changed in terms of growth rate
trajectory for the payment businesses. So, we think of high-single-digit growth in terms of the merchant and
corporate payments system categories and we think of mid-single-digit growth as we get into the credit card, debit
card kind of area.
As I mentioned, we had 4% or so and then 3% growth this quarter and the last two quarters, on a year-over-year
basis, we would expect momentum as we move forward and getting and approaching those sort of medium term
levels and some of the puts and takes I'd mentioned earlier are going to be kind of the drivers of that.
And, of course, whether or not we're on the higher end or the lower end is going to depend upon spend levels and
where that kind of ultimately comes through, but we feel confident in terms of where the market's going and how
that is. So, we feel like we're well positioned in that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then what's the prepaid card risk mitigation that you referred to? Maybe I missed if you've mentioned
that in the past, but could you just remind us what that is and how long it might be a [ph] drag for (00:39:58).
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Yeah. It's just more fraud and things of that variety that has picked up and so we just – there's just some
areas there that we want to mitigate against and so that we've chosen to just step away from some of those sorts
of things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then how much of a drag is that and how long will it continue? That's my last one. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, I think it's – and we saw the card growth rate was about 1% or so versus our sales area of about 3% to 4%.
So, I think there's going to be some of that pressure in the third quarter or so.

Hi. Thanks.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Couple of just follow-ups. One on payments. So, trying to understand, I know you said merchant, you expect to
get to high-single-digit. What's happening with the – when I look at the volumes, merchant was only up 1.7% year
on year and that's the slowest volume growth we've seen in six quarters. So, why has – despite all the tech-led
initiatives which are great and the other areas that you're trying to [indiscernible] (00:41:24)? Why has volume
growth slowed so much? And then what would cause that to turn around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, I can talk to that, Vivek. So, on the merchant processing side, you mentioned that the sales component
was about 2% or so. In terms of where we saw some volume decreases has really had to do with travel,
particularly on the European side of things. Volumes were just lower for our clients in that particular area. So,
that's really the focal point. I think if you think about, as we start to lap some of that sort of thing and same-store
sales come in and that sort of thing, that's where we expect the momentum in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Shifting gears, you're talking about charge-offs going to 60 basis points in the second half. Delinquencies
are down, so that should help. But your C&I losses are running high. Despite the losses, NPLs are running still up.
First, a two-part question there. Where in C&I are you seeing these losses? Which industry sectors? And your
overall charge-off rate of 60 basis points, which categories do you expect would tick that up from where you are
currently given the outlook for delinquencies coming down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, on your two-parter, I'll take the C&I question first. First of all, the increase there in charge-off was really
attributed to one unique or idiosyncratic loan that went through and that was an NPA that we saw couple quarters
ago that worked its way through. We don't anticipate anything really in the C&I book outside of that. So, that is
something that we're not concerned about.
On the rest of the charge-offs, if I think about just at a big picture on credit card, as an example, we did see a little
bit of an increase in charge-offs this quarter. But given the delinquency, as you just mentioned, we would expect
our charge-offs in the first – or the third and fourth quarter to look more like the first quarter. And I think the
balance of it will be more kind of in the commercial real estate office side of things. So, that's kind of the puts and
takes to the charge-off guide.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, you had one large loan written off. But then what refilled that bucket, John, given that the NPLs actually
ticked up, not down, in C&I?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, yeah. I mean, I think it's very – it's just very modest. It's more idiosyncratic type loans. It's not something that
we're holistically concerned about at any reach.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Vivek, as you mentioned, and as John mentioned, the delinquency levels are stable and so that drives
stabilization on credit card. The idiosyncratic loan that John mentioned, it was in the second quarter. And as we
think about the future of that, I think the lumpiness will come out of CRE office, and that's the one that's going to
go up and down a little bit. We've talked about that, we've mentioned that in prior calls. Certainly manageable, but
that will just cause a little bit up and down.

Good morning. Andy, I appreciate the color you gave on capital. And as you look at it, I know it sounds like you're
still on the sidelines on buybacks as you walk through your priorities and the expectation for capital here. But I
guess, what changes that? Is it continued pull-to-par on the AOCI side? Is it Basel III clarity? Is it clarity on rates?
What gets you to the point where you get confidence in buyback outlook or how you're thinking about your internal
CET1 target? If you could just walk us through your thought process there.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, let's start, John, by saying that I'm very confident in our capital levels and our ability to accrete capital.
It's consistent with what we've talked about, that 20 basis points to 25 basis points and we've made great
improvements as you saw from the number, 140 basis points up over the last year. So, let me start there.
Second, as we talked about before, we are seeking clarity on two components. Number one is CCAR, which we
now have, and number two is Basel III Endgame, which we're getting closer to. And my expectation, John, is that
we will – one way or the other, we'll have more clarity, if not the perfect answer, we will update on both our capital
targets and distribution objectives as we think about it at Investor Day on September 12. So, I'll give you a full
update at that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then separately, on operating leverage, I know you reiterated your confidence
in achieving positive operating leverage in the second half of this year. I mean, can you help us, I know you're not
giving formal 2025 expectations, but I'm trying to think about what that positive operating leverage you're
generating in the back half for that expectation, what that could mean as we look into the quarters through 2025.
I mean, it looks like incentives is ballparking around 300 basis points positive operating leverage when you look at
full-year 2025 expectations. You were above 200 basis points in 2022, but in the years prior, you were well below
that. What's a good way to think about it medium term in terms of where USB should be operating from that
standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Let me do it in components. So, first of all, as you saw this quarter, our expenses were relatively flat and we
focused on the $16.8 billion or lower for the full-year 2024. So, we are past the point of investment in the curve on
increasing expenses and now realizing the benefits from those expenses. So, I would expect us to be moderate
from an expense growth standpoint going forward and managing that well.
We talked about the momentum in fee growth, and I would expect that to continue given the unique businesses
we have. I think the biggest difference is the headwind that was net interest income turned into a tailwind this
quarter and as we talked about stabilization in the third quarter. I think as we get into 2025, that becomes more of
a tailwind, and those things all drive positive operating leverage into 2025.

Chris Kotowski Q

Hi. It's a small item, but a curiosity to me. I mean, I noticed that your automobile loan portfolio is down by more
than 30% year-over-year. And I'm just curious, how did that category suddenly become a, like, no-fly zone,
because you'd think that short-duration assets – you'd think it would be attractive given the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Sure, Chris. So, in terms of the drop, obviously, we haven't been as active in the auto loan market just
simply because the spreads and the returns on those sorts of loans have not been at our standard, and the
competitors that we're facing aren't banks and they have a different return profile in this particular environment.
That doesn't mean we've exited or anything like that. In fact, we've been very strong in terms of some of the
leasing and some of the other areas and we continue to monitor that market very closely. And if the spreads and
returns are appropriate, we will be very active in that space just as we have been in the past.

Just a follow-up on the cards growth, 1.4% year on year, credit up 4.3%. I guess, John, is that entirely due to the
exiting or the reducing of exposure to prepaid or are you seeing any weakness in debit as well? Because that
would be somewhat unusual. Typically debit in an environment where there is an economic slowdown tends to
outperform. So, just any additional color there? And just wanted to reaffirm that this is sort of a transitory thing and
you should lap this and – I suspect in the fourth quarter. Did I get that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think to answer your question there very simply, the difference between the fee growth versus the sales is
really all prepaid on that side of things. We see strong trends in terms of credit card spend and all – the union
penetration, all the things that I mentioned. Those are the things and all the different partnerships that we have,
those are all still very good. It's just that it's all on the prepaid side.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Okay. Go got it. And then just a follow-up on deposit dynamics. You've talked a few times about a slowing in the
rotation. But if I look at period-end noninterest-bearing, it did fall close to 5% sequentially, much different – much
worse than or much larger sequential decline than you see on average. Just anything there that you want to call
out? What drove that? And is it something that's somewhat transitory or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I want to – that's – thanks for asking that question because I want to point something out. We have a lot of
volatility in the day-to-day NIB deposit levels principally due to our corporate trust business that has payments
coming in and out on a daily basis. And depending upon where the quarter ends, the holidays, the end of the
week, the end of the month, you could have volatility. So, we are very focused on the average balances and I
would encourage you to do the same because day to day could be very volatile and it does not indicate any
trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Got it. All right. Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. During the last quarter, there's been a few management changes. People leaving, people getting repositioned.
And I think as we get ready for the September 12 Investor Day, we might look at the presenters and say, wow,
these are a lot different than the presenters at your last Investor Day. So, I'm just trying to figure out what the tea
leaves are saying. And maybe you can just tell us directly, Andy, in terms of what is your time horizon for

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
remaining CEO? I only ask that given some of these recent changes. So – and who are the contenders to be the
next CEO of U.S. Bancorp? And would you consider looking outside of U.S. Bancorp for your successor? Just
little more color on all these moves that have taken place. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Mike. So, as it relates to Investor Day, you're going to see some new faces for sure, but you're going to
see some familiar faces as well. So, we'll have a good mix of both people that you're very familiar with as far as –
and some new.
One of the things that we made a change with was putting Gunjan in the President's role. And about a year-and-
a-half ago, we combined what was then called WSIB, which is the – or we combined the Institutional Wealth
Group together with the Corporate and Commercial Group and the synergies and the activity and the customer
focus that evolved from that was just terrific.
So, Gunjan has that same objective to do that with the entire bank, with the Payments organization, with the
Consumer and Business Banking organization, and pulling together the leadership, the businesses under one
leader with the customer in the center and really taking advantage of all the diverse set of businesses that we
have to really grow the business, that's the objective. And she's done a terrific job with that already. She's already
started very fast to do it with the entire bank and I'm looking forward to sharing that story on September 12.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And the departures? Anything related to that? Is that – yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No. Yeah, Mike. I would just say that's natural activity. We've had a very stable senior leadership group for years
and years and sometimes change happens. But there's no messaging in that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And so, the theme, not to front-run your conference too much is it's one USB. So, you've done more one
USB with Wealth and Commercial and now you're looking to be one USB, deliver the whole firm to the client, that
sort of simple statement that's easy to say, tough to execute?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you.

Thanks, Mike.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks, guys. I just had a follow-up on the securities book. Just can you help us understand the meaningful
increase that happened this quarter in the yields? And then also, you mentioned 50% of the bond book is floating.
Is that the total bond book? And then can you help us understand how much of that book is swapped and what
you do with that going forward given the rate outlook? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, on the securities book, in terms of the quarter, the 19 basis point increase, a majority of that was related
to opportunistically taking some of the excess liquidity that we had and putting into the securities book. And so,
you can think of that as short data treasuries or treasury swap to floating, that sort of thing, which is the equivalent
from an interest rate risk perspective versus cash, is just a kind of a simple way to think about it.
In terms of the book itself, I would say that I made that comment because about – in terms of the AFS, risk and all
that sort of thing, we have hedged approximately 40% or so of the risk component. And then that, coupled with
just natural floating rate securities that we have within the book that are already floating, that gets you to about
50% that are either floating or synthetically floating through swaps. So, that's kind of the details of it.
Now, on the other side of that, we have put on hedges to – put receipt fixed swaps on our corporate book so that
if rates do fall, we're protected on that end as well. So, those are kind of the balances. All in, it gets us to where
we want to be from an interest rate risk standpoint, which is neutral to shocks, which is where we are today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So just, when you're saying that that gets you to around half of the total book, AFS and HTM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Cool. And sorry. Just one last one. Under $16.8 billion for cost after the second quarter result. Can you just
remind us what that means for the trajectory from here? And thanks again for follow-ups.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. $16.8 billion or less. That's our fee, or excuse me, that's our expense outlook. Where we have been over
the last couple quarters is very consistent with where we're at. As Andy talked about, we hit that point on the
investment curve. We continue to feel like we're in a very good spot in terms of managing expense going forward.
