I will now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3. In the third
quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 which included $0.14 per share of notable items related to
merger and integration charges. Excluding those notable items, we delivered earnings per share of $1.05 for the
quarter. Third quarter results were highlighted by linked quarter and year-over-year fee revenue growth that
benefited from our acquisition of Union Bank, deepening client relationships, and strong underlying business
activity. We are achieving the cost synergies we anticipated from Union Bank and continue to prudently manage
core expense as we identify operational efficiencies across the business. As of September 30, our Common
Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.7%, an increase of 60 basis points this quarter. This is the same level it was prior
to our acquisition of Union Bank. Total average deposits increased 3% or $15 billion on a linked quarter basis.
Credit quality continues to normalize this quarter, in line with expectations. And we further strengthened the
balance sheet by adding $95 million to our loan loss reserve, reflective of an evolving credit environment. On
October 16, the Federal Reserve granted us full relief from certain Category II commitments made in connection
with the Union Bank acquisition given our balance sheet reduction and capital actions. As a result, we are now
subject to existing capital rules or, if adopted, the same transition rules as all other Category III banks related to
enhanced capital requirements under the Basel III End Game proposal. As proposed, this would include a three-
year transition period for the expanded risk-based approach and AOCI regulatory capital adjustments starting in
the third quarter of 2025. I will discuss the impacts of this decisions further in my closing remarks.
Slide 4 provides income statement results as reported and on an adjusted basis, ending and average balances,
and other key metrics. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average
assets was 1.04% and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. While net interest margin declined 9 basis
points to 2.81% this quarter, in line with our expectations, we continue to expect the NIM to bottom in the fourth
quarter as we reach the end of the current rate hiking cycle. Turning to slide 6, a great benefit of our business
model includes a balance between our spread and fee income businesses that helps us reduce earnings volatility
through a business cycle. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income grew approximately 12%. Within
payment services, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities, expanding our payments ecosystem, and
optimizing our distribution.
Emphasis on expanded partnerships and integrated capabilities will continue to support tech-led growth across
merchant processing and increase opportunities across other areas of our payment services businesses.
Additionally, we are continuing to make investments that leverage our scale and strategic market positioning
across our corporate trust, mortgage banking, and capital markets businesses which should enhance our already-
strong annualized growth trajectories. Slide 7 highlights a few of our many post-conversion revenue opportunities
and expected cost synergies with Union Bank. Early indications of the potential of the deepened relationships with
legacy Union Bank loyal, affluent, and diversified client base are promising. And we continue to be on track to
realize approximately $900 million in cost synergies which we expect to be fully reflected in our run rate as we
head into the year 2024.
Let me now turn the call over to John who will provide more details on the balance sheet and results for the
quarter.

John C. Stern
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 8, we ended the quarter with total average assets of $664 billion and total average
loans of $377 billion, down $9 billion and $12 billion respectively on a linked quarter basis as we prudently
managed and optimized our balance sheet given the current macroeconomic and regulatory environment.
Average total deposits were $512 billion, representing a 3% increase linked quarter driven by expected
seasonality and growth in money market and time deposit accounts. Specifically, average non-interest-bearing
deposits decreased $16.2 billion this quarter primarily driven by our Union Bank retail customer upgrade [ph] and
(00:05:56) conversion from non-interest-bearing checking accounts to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly product.
Excluding this reclassification, the decrease would have been $6.2 billion.
Our mix of non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was approximately 19%, consistent with where we
expect the mix shift to stabilize based on historical performance and the operational nature of our core deposit
base. Slide 9 provides an update on the investment securities portfolio. As of September 30, our available-for-sale
securities were 97% of our total securities. We continue to reduce the effective duration of the AFS portfolio,
which is now less than three-and-half years. On slide 10, we provide a detailed earnings summary for the quarter.
This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.91 or $1.05 per share after adjusting for merger and
integration charges of $213 million net of tax or $0.14 per diluted common share. Turning to slide 11, net interest
income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.3 billion, which represented a 4.1% decrease
on a linked quarter basis, and a 10.7% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates and the
acquisition of Union Bank.
Our net interest margin declined 9 basis points to 2.81% in the third quarter. The linked quarter decline was
primarily due to the impact of lower earning assets, deposit pricing and mix shift, offset somewhat by better loan
spreads and funding mix. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Fee income increased 11.9% or $295
million on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher payment service revenue, trust and investment management
fees, commercial products and mortgage banking revenues. On a linked quarter basis, fee income increased
1.4% or $38 million, driven by other revenues, which included servicing revenue from previously executed
balance sheet optimization actions. Turning to slide 13, reported non-interest expense for the quarter totaled $4.5
billion, which included $284 million of merger and integration-related charges.
Non-interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $13 million or 0.3% on a linked quarter basis, driven by lower
compensation expense that was somewhat offset by our investments in marketing and business development.
Slide 14 shows our credit quality performance this quarter. While asset quality metrics reflecting changing
conditions in the commercial real estate office segment, results this quarter continue to trend in line with our
expectations, and key metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, given the higher interest rate
environment, as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased our reserve ratio for the commercial real
estate office loans to 10%. Our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.35% at
September 30 compared with 0.29% at June 30, and 0.20% a year ago.
Our third quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.44% increased 9 basis points from a second quarter level of 0.35% as
adjusted, and was higher when compared to a third quarter of 2022 level of 0.19%. Our allowance for credit
losses as of September 30 totaled $7.8 billion or 2.08% of period-end loans. Turning to slide 15, we continued to
take action to improve our capital ratios this quarter, increasing our CET1 ratio to 9.7% as of September 30. The
combination of our debt-to-equity conversion with MUFG, earnings accretion net of distributions and balance
sheet optimization actions resulted in a 60 basis point increase from last quarter. Importantly, our CET1 capital
ratio is now 270 basis points above our regulatory capital minimum. I will now provide fourth quarter forward-

looking guidance on slide 16. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income of between $4.1 billion and $4.2
billion.
Total revenue, as adjusted, is estimated to be in the range of $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, including approximately
$65 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be
approximately $4.2 billion, inclusive of approximately the $115 million of core deposit intangible amortization
related to Union Bank acquisition. On a core basis, we expect full year 2024 expenses to be flat with 2023. Our
income tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable-equivalent basis. We expect merger and
integration charges of between $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter.
I'll now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, John. Turning to slide 17, the Federal Reserve notified us on October 16 that they have granted us full
relief from Category II commitments made in conjunction with the Union Bank acquisition after considering several
factors, including actions to reduce our risk profile, strengthen our capital position and provisions related to
Category III rules made after we received approval on the Union Bank acquisition. This important decision now
subjects us to the same enhanced capital requirements as all other Category III banks, including a three-year
phase-in of AOCI into regulatory capital starting in the third quarter of 2025. As expected, we will continue to
carefully balance the need to accrete capital with any potential impact to earnings from further balance sheet
optimization activities. Measures to manage the interest rate sensitivity and duration of our available-for-sale
securities will continue.
Since before our acquisition of Union Bank, our priority has been and will continue to be the strategic execution of
capital-efficient growth opportunities across each of our business lines. As a result of the Fed's decision, we are
now well positioned with our enhanced earnings profile and diversified business mix to increase our capital levels,
continue our disciplined lending activities and further strengthen our balance sheet. Let me close by thanking our
more than 75,000 employees for their dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities and
shareholders.
We'll now open up the call to Q&A.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we can go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
Please go head.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess maybe the first question just around the Fed decision. In its letter, the Fed said, I guess, the bank
anticipated taking further actions to reduce risk profile and reduce assets and increase capital. So, if you don't
mind talking about just what additional actions we should expect, I think you mentioned that the EPS impact
would be neutral from here, but just how should we think about what else the Fed expects from you on the risk
mitigation side as we move forward into next year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Thanks, Ebrahim. Good morning. This is John. As a way of background, the Fed granted us, as you
mentioned, full relief from our Category II commitments and that's because of the actions – and Andy mentioned
this – of our actions to reduce risk as well as our ability to strengthen our capital position. So, importantly, this is
going to provide us additional time and flexibility to meet those new regulatory requirements and do so in the
same timeframe as our Category III peers. And additionally, we think it's going to reduce the downside risk given
the challenging rate environment. But nothing really changes in terms of how we're fundamentally managing the
balance sheet going forward. We're still committed to building regulatory capital, we're still expecting to increase
and accrete capital at a 20 basis points to 25 basis points on average per quarter.
And our expectation is to accelerate that as we get through the merger-related costs, or be in the high end of that
range, I should say, as we get through the merger-related costs and start to realize the full Union Bank synergies.
And we're still going to be executing risk-weighted asset optimization transactions, but now we have the time and
flexibility to do that over in a way that is low to neutral in terms of our earnings impact. And so, for all those
reasons, we feel like we have the flexibility in our balance sheet to do those sorts of things.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
I think that's exactly right, John, and the only thing I'd add is that part of this decision is reflective of what we've
already done for the last 12 months in terms of reducing the risk profile, building capital, optimizing the balance
sheet. And I want to be clear, Ebrahim, we are not under an asset cap at all. We are maintaining flexibility and
managing the balance sheet and capital and we'll continue to remain focused on capital-efficient growth, and that
includes focusing in on high-margin, high-return businesses that exceed our cost of capital while deepening
relationships with our most profitable clients and that has been and will continue to be our focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
That's good color. Thank you. And just a separate question. John. I think I heard you correctly – if I heard you
correctly, you mentioned you expect the NIM to trough, and I'm assuming NIM [ph] equals NII (00:15:50) to trough
in the fourth quarter. Maybe [indiscernible] (00:15:55) in terms of the steeper yield curve or widening in just the
curve risk that assumption around troughing of NII or NIM? And what gives you confidence around mix shift,
consumer behavior to feel good about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, I think in terms of the guidance we provided, we have embedded in there our rate forecast which
includes a rate increase in December. Whether or not that happens or not is relatively immaterial since we're fairly
neutral from an interest rate risk positioning standpoint. I guess what I would say is, as the Fed is continue –
whether they're done or not in terms of the rate hiking, we start to see a lot of the things on the deposit side slow
down, so our non-interest-bearing balances will be relatively stable here at this level. The deposit betas will – and
rate paid will start to slow down. And then on the other side, your assets will start to reprice, whether that's the
securities book, the loan book and all those sorts of things. So that's what gives us the confidence really that we
will bottom out here in the fourth quarter from a NIM and net interest income perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
[ph] Morning (00:17:18), John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning. John, could I just follow up on what you were just talking about? What are you looking at in
terms of the NIM for the fourth quarter roughly? And did I hear correctly you think the deposit mix kind of settles
out around 19%, 20% where you are here and beta kind of in the mid-40s? You still have those expectations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe just to go off the last couple questions you mentioned. So from a non-interest-bearing, yes, we do
expect that mix right about 19%, that's about where we will be, we expect that to be in that range. And from a beta
perspective, we are in the mid-40s right now. It's possible it could creep up higher depending on where the Fed
goes from here, but we feel good about that. And then in terms of the net interest margin and things like that, we
do anticipate a little bit more pressure here in the fourth quarter. But then, that really is the point where we feel it'll
bottom out based on my comments I just made to a previous question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And that's reflected in our revenue and net interest income guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then recognizing with the Fed decision, you've obviously got a lot more time to phase-in the AOCI now.
John, could you just give us a little more color on what happened in terms of the trend in AOCI this quarter? What
are the pieces there? And how do the swaps affect your burndown timeline? And just also if you could add on;
how do you calculate the capital with AOCI today? Looks like maybe around 7%, something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So I think all-in, it's about – AOCI is about 250 basis points of impact, so I would say 7.2% is probably
roughly kind of where I would think about it. In terms of the change in the AFS, obviously rates backed up on the
long end of the curve, 75 to 90 basis points depending on treasuries or mortgages that you're looking at. And that
had an impact of about $1.4 billion in our – on an after-tax basis on our AFS securities book which we would've
expected and is consistent with the duration of our book which we have continued to wind down as I mentioned in
our comments. About 3 – less than 3.5 years is our current duration, so that's the effect of that. We're continuing
to see – we will continue to see pay-downs in that book. Whether it's HTM or AFS, we have about –
approximately $3 billion or so per quarter that rolls off that book and will reinvest in the AFS side of things over
time.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just to be clear, how much of the $900 million merger savings were recognized in the third quarter results?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, in terms of – we will get to a full run rate of $900 million. It's probably – $100 million or so is kind of the – in
that range is probably what we were seeing, but it's been growing in terms of the amount and we'll see that full
benefit [ph] fall through (00:20:39) in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So relative to the third quarter, the first quarter of 2025 could see $800 million of additional expense savings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, because we've been – the savings have been generated all throughout the course of the year and they
accelerate third quarter into fourth quarter – second quarter, third quarter into fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So what's the cumulative merger savings? I guess how much more expense savings should there be when
they're fully realized in the first quarter relative to the third quarter?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
When we have the savings, we'll have approximately $400-or-so million that has gone through this full year. And
then we'll expect to see that in the next coming year, but that's embedded into our full year guidance of flat
expenses between 2023 and 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Mike, the way I think about it – this is Andy – by the end of the fourth quarter, we will be on a run rate
recognizing $900 million of savings which will be fully reflected in 2024 in our expense base. And that is
consistent with how we think about a relatively flat 2023 to 2024 expense base, including those savings plus
investments we'll continue to make in the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then the big question then is so if you have flat 2024 expenses, do you think you can get to positive operating
leverage or is it too early or too many moving parts because this is the sweet spot of the merger savings coming
up, right, by the next quarter...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It is the sweet spot, Mike, you're absolutely right. And the savings are great. The opportunities to deepen
relationships on the Union Bank customer base, I mentioned that in my comments, I think that is terrific. Our fee
businesses are doing extremely well. On a year-over-year basis, it was up 12% across almost every category;
and frankly, very little of that was related to Union Bank. That was just core improvement across a number of
categories, capital markets, our corporate and trust, our fee businesses, our payments businesses. The challenge
for us and for the entire industry is net interest income and margin. And in this environment, that's the one that –
there's a lot of moving pieces as you say. Loan growth is relatively tepid as we speak for us and for the industry
overall. So, it'll be dependent upon that in terms of positive operating leverage, and I would say it's too early to
call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And last follow-up. Your increase in CET1 ratio due to a lot of balance sheet optimization did come at a
cost of less assets, less loan growth, less earnings, right? There's a trade-off in that. So, now that you're under
kind of less pressure and have so much more flexibility, do you think you can be a little bit more [ph] lax
(00:23:43) in terms of your growth and in turn that may help NII, or is that too much of a stretch?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
We have flexibility now in terms of the transactions that we do to optimize, and we still have plans to do those
sorts of things. We've identified some things that are going to be relatively neutral and a little bit on the low end of
earnings impact. And of course, you saw some of those transactions in the second quarter pull through in terms of
provision and things like that, and that did lower our earning assets as you mentioned about $8 billion or
thereabouts this quarter.

Morning, John.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. I know despite the regulatory change around the Cat II requirement, you maintained the 20 bps to
25 bps generation in CET1 quarterly. Why no change there? Can you just talk to us maybe about the give and
takes in that expectation as the – the need to meet the Category II shifted to Category III, why no change there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, I think there's no change because we feel like given the new rule set and things like that, over time, we'll
have to transition into the new regime, which will include AOCI and so all of the other rules and so we're going to
be in a mode to continue to accrete that capital, and that 20 basis points to 25 basis points is our earnings stream
that we will accrete. And like this quarter, for example, is 20 basis points, but we anticipate going to 25 basis
points or on the higher end of that range as we get through the merger-related costs and we have the Union
synergies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. So, the less BSO activities didn't materially benefit that expectation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I'm sorry? Could you say that more? I couldn't hear you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
The less risk-weighted asset optimization efforts that would be needed now under the need to meet Category III
did not materially impact the 20 basis points to 25 basis points of earnings generation expected?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
No, that did not. No, that did not. And like for example, this quarter, we had 20 basis points of RWA actions, which
included some of the asset reduction. You saw earning assets lower, for example, as well as some other
transactions embedded. So, we separate out the core earnings when we're talking about 20 basis points 25 basis
points, core earnings from other RWA optimization transactions that we have the ability to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And then separately, is there any OpEx impact of the – of now needing to conform to the Category III
versus the more immediate requirements of Category II, anything on the expense side? And then separately, on
your margin bottoming comment, anything in terms of the trajectory in the margin that you would expect after you
see this bottoming – as we head into 2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, in terms of OpEx, no. There's no further investment. You may recall, before Tailoring, we had many of
the same rules and standards that we had in terms of liquidity rules and reporting and all those sorts of things. So,
we have all the capabilities built up or can quickly get to that level from an operational standpoint, so there's no
worries there. In terms of the net interest margin, we mentioned just a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and
then bottoming out, likely stable, but it'll still depend on interest rates quite frankly at that particular point in time.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just as it relates to sort of the balance sheet growth dynamic, so great to see
you out of that Fed restriction, do you see any risk that you'd exceed $700 billion in assets organically or come
into contact with any of the other Cat II restrictions organically in the timeframe that would subject you to Cat II
rules before your peers would have to get there under new levels? In other words, I'm just trying to kind of make
sure that this is indeed just a full, free and clear So just curious your thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It is. As Andy mentioned, there's no asset cap, so that we have complete flexibility here on our balance sheet
going forward. So, if we elect to grow or want to grow, and we do want to grow in a capital-efficient manner, we
will do so. What I would say though is that we're going to be emphasizing higher-return loans and deemphasizing
lower-return type of assets. And I think that will manifest itself as the balance sheet churns. And in addition to that,
I would just highlight that in this environment right now, the loan outlook is pretty low. The demand for loans is
quite low given a number of different reasons out there, but that gives us kind of the confidence that we have a lot
– have more time and flexibility here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then, I think you might have touched on this in an earlier question, but maybe if
you can sort of re-walk us through the sort of AOCI burndown and cash flow expectations coming off the – both
the AFS and HTM books. And then I think you might have given the duration of the AFS book, but do you have
that for the HTM book as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, in terms of the AFS and HTM, we're at about, in terms of balances, about $162 billion or so, and it's
about a 50/50 mix as we mentioned in the call in terms of AFS and HTM. So, we have about, as I mentioned, $3
billion of run-off per quarter on average just given the current interest rate environment and things of that variety.
In terms of our profile, we've been able to hedge about 30% of the fixed rate portion of the AFS book and so,
that's what has driven the duration of that particular book in the three and half – less than three-and-half years as
we have. The HTM book is principally all agency mortgage-backed securities which have longer lives and so, it's
more in the six or so – six-and-half range in terms of the duration of that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Andy, my first question is for you. Probably yesterday's announcement is a big win for the company. And as we
think about combining that relief with a generally tighter regulatory environment, what CET1 are you looking at
and what level are you looking at in terms of, okay, now I'm at the right level, this is now my target in the new
world, and now in an environment where balance sheet growth is minimal at best, right, I can now return capital
back to shareholders through buybacks? I guess I'm just wondering, because there's your printed CET – your
GAAP CET1, there's the adjusted that John gave, right? But then you only have to take into account 25% of that
[ph] $250 billion (00:31:56) by July 1, 2025, if we get to a final date by then. So, there's a lot of moving pieces. So,
as your investors think about all this progress that you've made, plus this relief, what is your new target? Is that
transitional or fully phased in?
And what's the bogey that investors could look forward to that you would hit before returning capital through
buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes, Erika. I understand the question. And first of all, I just want to highlight. We're back to 9.7%, which is where
we started before the deal and we're able to build, and we went from 9.7% to 8.4% and build the 130 basis points
in basically less than a year, which I thought was a great effort across the company. In terms of what our new
target is, I think our short-term target is to continue to build as we talked about. Remember there's two sets of
rules that are yet to be finalized and coming down: number one are the Basel III End Game finalization of rules,
which will in one way, shape or form increase capital levels; and the second is clarity on CCAR. We'll set those
targets once we have clarity on those two items.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And so just to follow up here, at least until June 2024 CCAR results, regardless of how quickly you build the
capital, either on an adjusted or on a GAAP basis, you're going to continue to be at pause on the buyback until at
least then, until we see the CCAR and the SCB?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
That's my expectation, Erika. We want clarity on the finalization of the Basel III and then CCAR importantly. So,
we'll be continuing to build capital and determine our capital targets and buffers and all that activity once we have
more clarity on the finalization of the rules.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. That's very clear. And just one more for John, if I may.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
In terms of the net interest income trajectory, I think the fourth quarter bottom is good news especially relative to
what we thought two days ago which would be more RWA mitigation. As we think about the RWA mitigation
ahead that's less impactful to EPS, should we think about it similar to what we saw early in the year in terms of
securitizations? Are you more actively – are you kind of going to continue to use credit-linked notes which I
assume is – cost you 12.5% or so of the pool plus SOFR and spread? And as we think about those dynamics, do
you feel like you have to warehouse more liquidity as we anticipate LCR rules for regional banks because we're
also hearing that there could be pretty significant haircuts on how they're thinking about HTM as HQLA?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Erika. So maybe I'll start with your last point. On LCR, we will – in addition to what Andy said on the capital
side, we're going to have to wait and see what it is on the liquidity side in terms of any potential changes that
come out of LCR. We feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve whatever that change is and feel that
we'll be able to achieve that whatever that scenario is; we'll work into it. In terms of – you talked about the net
interest income. We feel like – again, just to kind of reiterate, we're looking for that to bottom at this particular
point in time in the fourth quarter, and where it kind of goes from there post it will depend in part by interest rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q

Got it, and congratulations on the release of commitments.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Andy, obviously, U.S. Bancorp has developed a reputation of being a strong underwriter, and we've talked about
this in the past with you folks. And I was wondering if you could frame out the environment because every bank is
talking about credit normalization as you guys did because we had such great numbers coming out of the
pandemic on credit. And if you just exclude for a moment the economy because obviously, none of us can control
that, but I'd really be interested in what you guys are seeing from a competitive standpoint in terms of underwriting
and if you could compare it to past cycles. Obviously, we've been around for a few cycles and can compare it, but
I'm curious from your guys' vantage point. Is it as risky today as it may have been in 2005/2006 or 1999/2000?
Any color there that you can share with us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, let me give you the big picture and I'm going to ask Terry to highlight some specifics. I would say the
consumer is entering this cycle in very strong shape. From a balance standpoint, from the perspective of savings
accounts that they have, the spend activity, I think are all starting to normalize but normalize to a pre-pandemic,
what I would say, normal level. The companies and small businesses are also in very good shape. The one area
that we're all very focused on is commercial real estate office which is one of the areas that we increased our
reserve to as you know, it's at 10% this quarter. So maybe, Terry, you can go into some specifics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And what I would add to that, Gerard, is as you know, when we think about underwriting, we really
underwrite through a cycle. We try to take into consideration stress from an underwriting perspective, what could
happen in terms of rise in interest rates or other economic factors that could come into play. So we haven't
adjusted our underwriting standards a lot as we have been thinking about this particular cycle. I do think that

U.S. Bancorp
(USB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
when you end up looking at the industry, I think there is some tightening that's going on out there. Certainly from a
competitive standpoint, we are seeing that to some extent but we feel like we're in pretty good shape. If you end
up looking at our situation, as Andy said, probably the area that we're monitoring the most is commercial real
estate office space specifically. We have a reserve that's about 10% of the overall balance there. We have been
increasing that and we're likely to continue to increase that because that's going to be a pressure point.
But we're starting from – if you think about the overall portfolio, we're starting at a fairly low point. Our non-accrual
loans is only 35 basis points of total loans, our allowance is strong at 2.08%, delinquencies are still at relatively
low levels although increasing. And our expectation as we go into 2024 is that that normalization will continue;
delinquencies will continue to kind of move up and non-performing assets will continue to move up. But I think
we're in a really good position in terms of the allowance coverage that we have and we feel pretty good about
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Good to hear your voice, Terry. Just to follow up on what you were saying. From a competitive
standpoint, do you sense – the extreme, of course, was 2005/2006 when all of the crazy lending was being done
by some banks but also the non-banks. When you guys look at the non-bank competitors, are there rogue players
out there that are just doing crazy things so that the second derivative impacts the banks, not because any of the
banks, yourself included, made a poor underwriting decision but it was the competitors that really did something
foolish and now the banks are suffering a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Or – again, not like 2006, I'm not suggesting we're there, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...just, yeah, from a comparison standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think both in the bank and in the non-bank space, I think that people are being fairly rational. Part of the issue is
that it's maybe more so on the demand side of the equation as much as anything. I think corporate America is
being relatively cautious out there. They're still waiting to see where interest rates settle in at, and until they see
more certainty with respect to what the interest rate and inflationary environment looks like, I think corporate
America is being relatively cautious and therefore, demand is relatively soft. But, we're not seeing, what I would

say, crazy things either on the bank or on the nonbank side at this particular point in time. In fact, we're probably
seeing, if you end up looking at commercial real estate, probably a pullback across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then as my second follow-up question, Andy, it was obviously great news that you guys had yesterday
about the release. Is there any read-through – obviously, you sat down with the regulators to get that release, and
they seem to be fairly rational in their decision to make that change. There's been a lot of hope and criticism that
the Basel III End Game proposals are pretty darn strict. Do you think – is there any read-through where we may
actually see some rationality with the regulators and they may kind of pare back some of those requirements, or is
that too far of a stretch?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Too early.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think the regulators have asked for feedback. The banks will provide feedback, both collectively and individually.
I think a lot of the feedback is good feedback, because of the consequences to our customers, and I think that's
the area of focus that we're going to be very pointed on in terms of our feedback and we want to make sure that
from a banking standpoint, we're able to serve our customers and the rule set will create some friction around that
in certain categories, and that's where we're going to focus in. And my anticipation is that the Fed will listen to our
perspectives and that's my hope.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Vice Chair & Chief Administration Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I was just going to say, and particularly it can be punitive with respect to low and moderate income customer
base. You see some capital rules related to renewable energy, tax credits that don't make – that seem punitive at
this particular point in time. So, I do think there's a number of different areas where there's opportunity for
adjustment.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. Shifting gears from capital, given that you've made a lot of progress, to just our normal business.
Payments, you've talked, Andy, about wanting to grow much in processing, mid- to high-single digits, really more
in the high-single digits and some of the others in the low-double digits like corporate payments. Any color on –
any thoughts on how you get back up there because that hasn't been the case last couple of quarters, what you
need to do or change or what would help you get there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I'm going to ask John to start, then I'll add in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. So, in terms of merchant processing, we have been making a number of investments over the years, and
continue to expect that high-single digit in terms of the merchant sort of thing. The numbers have been strong this
quarter, but there's normalization that has been happening. And so, in the quarters, that have – the quarter-to-
quarter here, the last several quarters, there's been a lot of – of the nuances coming out of the COVID and all
those sorts of things. So, if you think about airline tickets and hotels and corporate T&E, those have been very
strong, but they're normalizing. That said, services and retail have been strong. And so – and the retail print that
we saw yesterday was very constructive. So, we feel like there's good underpinnings there in addition to the
investments that we make to continue to believe and give us confidence in that – in our projections there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And I think two of those most important investments, Vivek, are our tech-led initiative, which is about a third of our
revenue base right now is tech-led from a perspective of new activity; and secondly is that – what we've talked a
lot about which is this business payments ecosystem which continues to be a top priority for the company
because I think it's a huge opportunity for our Business Banking customer base as well as our Commercial

customer base. And then you add in what we're getting from Union Bank, I think that's why we're confident in that
higher single-digit increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then another fee business that you mentioned, you're expanding capital market. Since you're not doing
your Investor Days anymore, any color on what you're doing there to expand that? You've always had the loan
syndications and debt capital markets. What else are you doing to step that up in terms of the level of revenues
from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. This is John. So, the – we've – this is another area where we have continued to make investments in back-
end systems and the frontline and acquiring talent and all these sorts of things, and it's been a great story for us
and we continue to invest in this going forward. And along with high-grade and underwriting, there's high yield as
well as what other areas that have been very strong is in the derivative market, providing interest rate hedging
products for our clients, especially in this time where interest rates are moving around quite a bit. That's a service
that has been highly needed. Foreign exchange has been a growing component here as well. And particularly
now with Union Bank, we have more of a West Coast customer base and more of a foreign exchange need. In
addition to some of the businesses that we work with in the corporate trust side, we have – as you know, we have
businesses in Europe as well.
So, there's always some form of foreign exchange, and so we've seen a lot of growth there. In addition to that,
we've been gaining market share in the investment grade business and high yield over the – the coming days. I
think we've had an investment grade in the top 10 now in terms of market share. So, that has been a business
that has continued to advance slow and steady and it's been a good item for us – business for us.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I was wondering – slide 7 shows some of the revenue opportunities. I was wondering if you could size that.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Starting with the UB deal, the revenue synergies related to the UB deal that you outline on slide 7. Is there any
way to frame how big that might be or in what timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
It is a high priority for each of our businesses. Probably the greatest priority is the first one we highlight, which is
our credit card opportunity. The payments business is a strength of U.S. Bank. Our card offering is terrific. And
we've already had a penetration increase from where we started, and that continues to be a focus. And then you
think about that with the business clients as well, I think that it is a material impact, but we're still working through
exactly the sizing and timing, and we'll continue to update on that, but it is a priority and a focus area for each of
our businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, a little bit of a technical question. I forget some of my CFA materials, but when we
look at the securities book of a duration of less than three-and-half years, but you're only burning down 25%
through 2025. Remind me how that math works, and does the burndown kind of step up as we think about 2026?
Right? Because the duration is pretty short and the burndown is not all that much in the first couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Stern A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. The function of the curve really changed as – is that the – we saw the curve flatten out quite a bit this
quarter. What I'd say on that is, we have a number of securities that obviously are fixed rate that have longer
durations to them or longer average lives. And so – and then we have a number of – with our – the security
portion there where we have swaps, that is very low duration. It's three months or so because of how it swapped
to the floating rate index. So, in addition to that, as we've added on some of the security book, we have about $8
billion or so of – when we did some of the [ph] auto repack (00:48:43) transactions in the fourth quarter of last
year as well as the second quarter of this year, that is very short as well, in addition to some of the floating rate
securities within that book. So, it's kind of more of a barbell approach which gives you the duration of it which just
gives us a value change for a move in interest rates.
But in terms of the burndown, that'll depend in part about -- how the shape and the type of securities that are
within the book.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Okay. That's helpful. Obviously, less relevant now given the Fed's decision, but still something we're all tracking,
so thank you.

Operator: And next, we can go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. So, just one more follow-up on the Category II news. I just want to make sure we're super
clear. So, does $700 billion stop being a bind forever, or obviously, you don't have to cross on the prior potential
timeframe? But to the prior question, just wondering, you said there's – you don't have an asset cap, so does that
mean that Category II is now a non-thing for U.S. Bank going forward in any time period, or when you cross
naturally, do you still get on the natural clock of having to comply? Just wondering how that fits in with the news
you got yesterday.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, we're bound, Ken, by the current rule set, which is after four quarters of an average of $700 billion, then you
would go to Category II, or the new Basel III rule set which is yet to be finalized, as you said. But the current rule
set is what we're bound on. So, $700 billion still is important, but what we're saying is given where we think asset
growth will be, given our continued optimization in certain categories, given our focus on high-return businesses,
we do not see that as a hurdle to growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Understood. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Thank you, Andy.

You bet.
