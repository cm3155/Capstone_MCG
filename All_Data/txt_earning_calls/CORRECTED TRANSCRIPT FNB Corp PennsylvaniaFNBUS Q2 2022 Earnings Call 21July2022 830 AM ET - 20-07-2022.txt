Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. The second quarter's earnings per share totaled
$0.31 on an operating basis, up 19% linked-quarter. F.N.B. continued to execute its strategic plan in the second
quarter with record loan growth at $1.3 billion on a spot basis, excluding PPP. We maintained a favorable deposit
mix in a rising rate environment. Even as seasonal outflows occurred this quarter. We achieved record revenue of
$336 million, with 8% linked-quarter growth and net interest income and our fee businesses continued to exhibit
the benefits of diversification with 5% net growth.
Our expenses remained well-controlled, declining linked-quarter on an operating basis and led to an acceleration
of positive operating leverage and an efficiency ratio of 55.2%. As always, our asset quality remained focused
with our solid reserve coverage and net recoveries this quarter. Profitability improved significantly in linked-quarter
as return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%. We prudently managed capital as our dividend payout
ratio was 39% and we purchased 1.1 million shares in the quarter. In addition to solid performance in the quarter,
we commenced the rollout of our new digital eStore kiosks in all F.N.B. branches and announced the UB Bancorp
acquisition in North Carolina.
Our strong revenue growth included the benefit from the Federal Reserve's increase in short-term interest rate.
However, it's our team's proven ability to respond and adapt to the changing economic environment that resulted
in a record net interest income of $254 million as 35% or $11.7 billion of our deposits are non-interest bearing and
59% of our loans possess variable or adjustable interest rates. These factors position us well for the anticipated
rising rate environment. Vince Calabrese will provide additional insights on key performance drivers and deposit
base.
Total loans and leases, excluding PPP, reached $28 billion, demonstrating record linked-quarter growth of $1.3
billion or 19.5% annualized, making this the fifth consecutive quarter of positive loan growth. Building upon the
first quarter, spot loan growth totaled an impressive 11.2% on a year-over-year basis, excluding PPP and the
Howard acquired loans.
On a core basis, commercial loans grew $504 million linked-quarter with ending balances at $18 billion. This
growth was led by Pittsburgh and the North and South Carolina markets.
Our year-to-date production is over 20% higher than the first half of 2021 and current pipeline levels are healthy
when compared to historical trends. On a spot basis, consumer loans grew $795 million linked-quarter with over
$400 million in residential mortgage loan growth.
Our Physician's First mortgage program had an outstanding quarter, accounting for 66% of the total residential
mortgage increase linked-quarter. This program establishes long-term relationships of significant lifetime value.
From a credit quality perspective, this is one of our highest quality portfolio, with credit scores of nearly 800 and
delinquency levels of 5 basis points.
Our mortgage growth is bolstered by the success of our eStore with 69% of all mortgage applications submitted
digitally. The adoption rate across our digital offerings continues to steadily increase with the total number of loan
applications online up 45% from the year-ago quarter. Our customers' growing digital engagement also translated
into increased lending activity in our traditional branch channel and contributed to [Technical Difficulty] (00:06:07)
consumer originations in our branches this quarter. Our online and mobile eStore visits have more than doubled
since June 2021 and we continue to build upon this momentum.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
As mentioned earlier, in addition to mobile and online access, we have started an initiative to supplement all
F.N.B. branches with new digital eStore kiosks to enhance the consultative environment we provide. The fully
interactive design empowers customers with an intuitive digital access to F.N.B.'s full range of products and
services.
As a result, customers were able to easily browse and buy products and services as part of the in-branch
experience or continue to process seamlessly online through their mobile device wherever and when they prefer.
The investments we've made in our digital bank have enhanced our scalability and accelerated our growth.
Our success is also linked to the expansion of our branches. Last month, we announced the acquisition of UB
Bancorp, a North Carolina-based bank with approximately $1.2 billion in total assets, $1 billion in total deposits
and $670 million in loans. Approximately 40% of the deposits are non-interest bearing. This acquisition increases
F.N.B.'s presence in North Carolina to a top 10 deposit share in the state. This region has proven to be a growth
engine for F.N.B.
Adding the low-cost granular deposits will also benefit our financial performance in a rising rate environment. We
are excited about our prospects and we welcome the UB Bancorp team and customers to F.N.B. Overall, the
second quarter provided solid financial results and F.N.B. is well-positioned in the current macroeconomic
environment. One of F.N.B.'s core strength is our credit performance, which has been proven in the economic
downturn in 2008 and again during the recent pandemic. Gary and our team take a proactive approach to
managing the bank's credit portfolio and collectively offer decades of experience.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary to provide more detail on our asset quality and comments on the economic
environment. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Our credit results for the second quarter showed continued
positive performance with our key credit metrics trending favorably as we enter the second half of the year in a
position of strength. We saw lower past due and non-performing levels during the quarter as well as a decline in
rated credits and loan loss levels, all of which contributed to a further strengthening of our credit portfolio.
We'll first review our GAAP asset quality highlights for the second quarter, and later in my remarks I'll provide an
update on Howard Bank and the recently announced UB Bancorp acquisition as well as some brief commentary
on the macroeconomic environment and how we're managing those potential risks.
Let's now look at our results for the second quarter. Total delinquency ended June at a historically low level of 58
basis points, down 8 bps over the prior quarter which was driven by improvements in the commercial portfolios,
the early-stage past due in non-accrual levels. NPLs and OREO also declined on a linked-quarter basis, down 5
basis points to end June at a solid 35 bps. Net charge-offs for Q2 ended in a net recovery position of $400,000 or
minus 1 basis point annualized. And for the year-to-date period, net charge-offs totaled $1.5 million or 1 basis
point annualized. We recognized provision expense of $6.4 million, which supported strong loan growth in the
quarter and also reflects lower prepayment speed assumptions in our seasonal CECL model. This resulted in an
ending June reserve of $378 million or 1.35% of loans at quarter-end which represents a 3-basis point decrease
versus the prior quarter, remaining directionally consistent with our favorable credit quality results. Our NPL
coverage position remains strong at 409%.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
I'd now like to provide a brief update on the Howard portfolio and the recently announced UB Bancorp acquisition.
As it relates to Howard, the credit portfolio has not had a material impact to our overall credit metrics and that it
continues to perform well and in-line with our expectations. We remain pleased with the transition process and
continue to track the portfolio closely as is our standard practice in the quarters following an acquisition. We also
recently announced the acquisition of UB Bancorp, which will further position us in the Carolinas and offer
additional lending and cross-sell opportunities in these attractive markets. Regarding the loan portfolio, we
estimated a credit mark at 1.6% at due diligence as the book continues to perform in-line with our expectations
with no material impact expected to our credit metrics. We look forward to expanding our client relationships and
our range of products that will be available to UB Bancorp's customer base.
I would now like to turn your attention to the economy and our approach to managing risk in this environment of
accelerated inflation, rising interest rates, elevated energy costs, and ongoing labor and supply chain challenges.
These economic headwinds remain at the forefront of our credit decisioning process to understand and mitigate
economic-driven risks and challenges faced by our borrowers. Many of our commercial banking customers have
exercised interest rate hedging options as part of our derivative program, which enables them to reduce rate
sensitivity and lower their borrowing costs moving into this environment. On the direction of the broader economy
and competitive lending environment all remains to be seen in the quarters ahead, we remain committed to our
standard practice of consistent and sound underwriting across the entire footprint as well as ongoing and
proactive monitoring of our book to identify early signs of current or potential future stress. By leveraging our
robust data analytics framework, we can monitor credit trends and performance metrics for all products and lines
of business, allowing us to better manage emerging risks quickly and comprehensively across the entire loan
portfolio.
In summary, we had a strong quarter marked by continued improvement in our credit quality, reduced rated credit
levels, solid high-quality loan growth and strong positioning of our portfolio headed into the second-half of the
year. That said, we continue to remain cautious on the forward-looking economy as we enter a possible
recessionary phase. Our focus remains on the continued disciplined approach to our core credit fundamentals
that have served us well throughout prior economic cycles.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus on second quarter's financial results and offer
guidance for the third quarter and full-year of 2022. Overall, the second quarter financials capture the strong
performance of F.N.B. with reported net income available to common shareholders totaling $107.1 million or
earnings per share of $0.30. After adjusting for $2 million of merger-related expenses, net income reached $108.7
million or $0.31 per share. Balance sheet growth is very strong and excluding PPP, period end total loans
increased $1.3 billion or 19.5% annualized on a linked-quarter basis including an annualized increase 34% in
consumer loans and 12% in commercial. Commercial loan growth was led by commercial and industrial
annualized growth of 29% excluding PPP. The majority of the quarter's growth was concentrated in June, which
will benefit the third quarter average balance. Additionally, commercial line of credit utilization increased to 2%
linked-quarter with expectations that it will continue to build through the end of the year. Consumer loan growth
was driven by strong organic residential mortgage and home equity lending activity. As Vince mentioned, the
Physician's First mortgage program has been very successful, making up two-thirds of this quarter's net growth in
mortgage loans. While the Physician's First program is seasonal in nature, we expect this high-quality loan
portfolio to continue to build. Another element of residential mortgage activity is shifting customer preferences for
adjustable rate in mortgages. In 2021, mortgage originations comprised of 84% fixed rate and 16% ARMs. In the
5

(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
second quarter that ratio has transitioned to 47% fixed rate and 53% ARMs as customers optimized payment size
given rising interest rates and increased home values.
On the income statement, net interest income totaled a record $253.7 million, an increase of $19.6 million or 8.4%
due to growth in average earning assets and benefits from the higher interest rate environment which was
partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease contribution from PPP as those balances wind down. The net interest
margin increased 15 basis points this quarter to 2.76%. An area of heightened focus this quarter and for the next
several quarters is deposit betas given the actions taken by the Federal Reserve. Knowing it is not an exact
comparison, our cumulative deposit beta, the total deposits during the last interest rate hiking cycle from
December of 15 to December of 18 was 24%. It's important to keep in mind three main differences from the
previous cycle: First is that the Federal Reserve is hiking at a much faster rate than in 2016. Secondly, the
emergence of high cost deposit-gathering fintechs; and third our deposit mix is in a more favorable position today
with non-interest-bearing deposits at 35% of total deposits and a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio at 84% versus
97% at the end of 2015. To-date, we have been able to effectively manage deposit costs while balancing deposit
mix shifts that have occurred.
Turning to non-interest income and expense, non-interest income totaled $82.2 million, a $3.8 million or 5%
increase from last quarter. Capital markets income was $8.5 million, an increase of 20% with solid contributions
from swap fees, international banking, syndications and debt capital markets. Service charges increased $3.2
million linked-quarter largely due to growth in interchange income and treasury management fees driven by higher
customer transactions and new client acquisition. A $1.4 million increase in bank-owned life insurance reflected
life insurance claims received during the quarter.
Mortgage banking operations income decreased $0.5 million or 8% as loan production to be sold in the secondary
markets declined 11% linked-quarter given the higher mortgage rates. Refinance activity only accounted for 21%
of our second quarter sold production, compared to 53% in the year-ago quarter.
Reported non-interest expense totaled $192.8 million, a decrease of $34.7 million or 15.2%. On an operating
basis, non-interest expense decreased $3.9 million or 2.0% compared to the prior quarter, excluding merger-
related expenses of $2 million in the second quarter 2022 and merger-related expenses of $28.6 million and
branch consolidation costs of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. Given these adjustments, the rest of the
expense fluctuations will be given on an operating basis. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $8.3 million
from last quarter's seasonally higher long-term compensation expense of $6.2 million and seasonally higher
employer-paid payroll taxes.
Marketing increased $1.4 million, as we expanded our digital advertising and launched campaigns for our
Physician's First Program. Reflective of our diligent expense management, the efficiency ratio came down to
55.2%, a significant improvement compared to the first quarter's ratio of 60.7% and the year-ago quarter's ratio of
56.8%. Excluding PPP income, the efficiency ratio actually improved over 600 basis points on a year-over-year
basis.
Tangible book value per common share was $8.10 at June 30, an increase of a $0.01 per share from March 31.
While AOCI reduced the current quarter-end tangible book value per common share by $0.72 compared to $0.57
at the end of the prior quarter, the higher level of earnings more than offset that impact. The increased unrealized
losses in the AFS portfolio due to rising interest rates should accrete back into capital over time as securities
mature or prepay. Our CET1 regulatory capital ratio declined approximately 25 basis points to 9.7%, primarily due
to the significant loan growth in the quarter as well as putting more cash to work through additions to our
securities portfolio. We would expect to manage this ratio higher throughout the remainder of the year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Now, let's turn to guidance which excludes the announced UB Bancorp acquisition. Given the strong loan growth
this quarter, we increased our full-year guidance for loans to grow at a low- to mid-teens growth rate with
underlying organic growth in the high single-digits on a year-over-year spot basis. Total deposits are projected to
grow mid- to high-single digits on a year-over-year spot basis. Full-year net interest income is expected to be
between $1.05 billion and $1.09 billion with the third quarter between $278 million and $284 million.
Our guidance currently assumes 150-basis-point of rate increases for the remainder of the year, including a 75-
basis-point increase this month. Full-year non-interest income is expected to be between $310 million and $320
million with the second (sic) [third] (00:22:13) quarter in the high-$70 million area. The revised non-interest
income guidance is due to slightly lower mortgage banking income [Technical Difficulty] (00:22:23) reduced
market-related fee income.
There is no change to our guidance for non-interest expense on an operating basis in the range of $760 million to
$780 million for the full year and $190 million to $195 million for the third quarter. This does not include the one-
time expenses associated with acquisitions and branch consolidations. Positive credit quality is expected to
continue throughout 2022 with provision guided to $20 million to $40 million. This range does not include the initial
$19.1 million of provision related to Howard and is dependent on net loan growth for the remainder of the year.
Lastly, the effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19% for the full year, but is dependent on the level of
investment tax credit activity.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince. In summary, our team delivered exceptional quarterly results in a fluid economic environment
while fulfilling a number of key strategic objectives such as record loan growth, record total revenue, a 15.5%
return on tangible common equity, solid efficiency ratio of 55% with disciplined expense control and a dividend
payout ratio at 39%.
Our team remains keenly focused on maintaining strong credit quality. This quarter includes net recoveries and
solid reserve coverage. As you can see, we have got many accomplishments already in 2022 which doesn't
happen without the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to
our employees who make our success possible.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first
question will be from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. First, on the loan growth which remains very
impressive, I guess just looking at the remainder of the year, the compositions of the expected guide, assuming
much of that is coming from the commercial portfolio, but maybe just talk through the composition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of the loan growth, Timur, we're looking at good participation across all of the books of business.
Each business line participated very nicely this quarter. Pipelines continued to remain solid. We're getting good
participation across our geographies and from a consumer standpoint, the pipelines, albeit slightly down, that's
seasonal in nature pretty much. The second quarter is really a seasonal event for us when you look at that
consumer portfolio.
The mortgage book applications are down a little bit as well as you would expect. So, we'll see a little slower
growth there. But when you look across the board, the C&I continues to be solid, CRE as well with some seasonal
slowness in that home equity and mortgage portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And as you look at the competitive landscape in the face of rising rates, are you seeing incremental spread
pressure as you're fighting for new business or does the diversified geography products that kind of help mitigate
some of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We've not seen additional spread pressure here of late. Actually, the diversified geography helps from that
standpoint. But from a pricing standpoint, we've seen some slight improvement there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And I guess as we go through the rest of the year and how you're thinking about funding the loan growth, I
appreciate the deposit guide obviously. But as you're looking at funding that loan growth and the acquisition that's
slated to close in the back-end of the year, the remaining on-balance sheet liquidity, how does that all figure in? Is
the expectation to kind of fund it one-for-one? Is there incremental liquidity that you're willing to use on the
balance sheet in advance of the deal closing later this year? Any color on the funding side would be helpful.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
The transaction that we closed – this is Vince Delie. If we are able to close the transaction this year, we'll get a
benefit because it's principally a deposit play. The deposit portfolio is fairly substantial for the size of the bank.
There's tremendous amount of granularity. The cost of funds in that portfolio is low. We're bringing it over
additionally at 10 basis points growth.
[indiscernible] (00:28:03)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean I think that that will be additive. That will help us. But if you look at where we are today, we're sitting
at 84% loan-to-deposit ratio. We have 35% in deposits. Our mix is the strongest it's ever been. Our liquidity
position, while we've drawn down cash, is still substantial. I think we're in a very good position relative to lending
and achieving good returns in that space, particularly commercial lending in the second half of the year. So, I
think we're in a really good place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
From a funding perspective, right, we're not concerned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I would just add, I mean at the end of June, we had $1.6 million of kind of the excess cash still on the balance
sheet. So – that was $3.4 million at the end of the first quarter. We obviously use that to fund the loan growth you
saw on a spot basis. So, there's still ample liquidity just sitting right there for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We continue to win depository relationships, particularly in the Southeast that's starting to accelerate for us.
Larger Treasury management clients in the commercial segment so I would expect that to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then just last for me on the securities book, maybe talk through the purchases you were
making this quarter and what you're seeing there for reinvestment yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. During the second quarter, we invested $768 million into the portfolio, about $400 million higher than the
cash flows to take advantage of the rate environment that was there. We reinvested in an average rate of 3.27% a
quarter; that was 1.90% last quarter so a significant move up there and it's well-above the roll-off rate of 1.85%,
so a nice benefit there. And if you look ahead, I mean duration-wise, we continue to be on the shorter end. We've
9


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
been around 4.0%. Our estimated 12-month cash flow is just under $1 billion to be coming off at around 1.91%.
So, putting stuff on it; 3.27%, they were probably putting stuff on this month more like 3.50%.

Good morning, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. I thought your comments on deposit rates were very interesting in terms of everything that could impact
those – this cycle relative to the prior cycles. I'm not sure, maybe I missed it, but could you kind of just indicate
where you think that they actually may shake out or what your best guess is or what you're budgeting for given all
those factors that you mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. Yeah. Obviously the level of liquidity in the banking system is still the duration to how this all is going to play
out. Yeah. At this point, I would add that we've seen no pressure at all on the retail deposit side. It's really been
conversations with municipal commercial customers that have started to ship funds from money market deposits
into CDs. So that's kind of natural mix shift has been occurring.
If you look at where we are so far, our cumulative betas is 9% on total deposits, 15% on interest-bearing deposits
as of the end of June. And then what's baked into our guidance based on what we know today, 22% for total
deposits and 33% interest-bearing deposits by the end of the year will be the cumulative data at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And then my other question is just around share repurchases. You repurchased
shares this quarter. Capital has been stable. Obviously, you have the deal coming in the fourth quarter. But just
kind of overarching thoughts on outside of maybe the period where you're unable to repurchase, how you're
thinking about share repurchases? Is it more of a kind of a steady quarter-to-quarter amount that you're looking to
repurchase or more opportunistic?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
I would start that we continue to target a CET1 ratio around 10% in the level we've been discussing. It did come
down about 25 basis points this quarter just given strong loan growth, recent investments that I mentioned, the
advantages of higher yields and those are coming out of cash, 0% risk weighting. So, you have that dynamic
happening during the quarter. As we look ahead and it's baked into our guidance, we would expect that to get
back up to 20% by the end of the year just given our higher earnings generation levels, the dividend payout ratio
and our overall asset-sensitive positioning.
Regarding buybacks, it's kind of the same. We talked about – I mean our first and best use of capital is organic
loan growth. So, the level of buybacks will be dependent on the growths we see for the rest of the year. But we'll
be opportunistic as we have been in the past. We did buy 1.1 million shares this quarter and if the opportunity
makes sense, i.e. on the loan growth [indiscernible] (00:33:36) back. And overall we're going to – just committed
to managing capital in a way that's fully aligned with shareholder interest. So it's a constant evaluation for us.

I wanted to just kind of start with a big picture question and you guys kind of talked around it in a few different
ways in your prepared remarks and some of the questions that have been asked already. But just like this – this –
I guess balancing this environment with the kind of the uncertainty in the back-half of the year versus what seems
like, like on the ground today like pretty good momentum from a loan growth standpoint, customer growth
standpoint. I guess with your diverse footprint how do you guys think about balancing those two things and are
there certain areas or whether it's from a deposit beta side or a loan growth side, like the credit side that you feel
better about? From a market standpoint today within your footprint, are there areas where maybe you're more
concerned, whether that's because of real estate changes or anything like that, just color there would be helpful.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, first of all, I think the diversification strategy that we pursued enables us to be more selective from a credit
perspective. That was the thesis that we laid out from the very beginning. As we gained share in markets like
Pittsburgh, it becomes more and more challenging to grow portfolios and not change the risk profile in that
portfolio and there are competitors. They have – they're well-entrenched here. And while we were able to grow
fairly significantly in a short timeframe, you get to a point where you hit saturation for good quality credits. And our
philosophy was to stay within a tight underwriting range so that we weren't inconsistent with cycles. We did it the
last time and we put together a number of linked-quarters where we had loan growth throughout the last
economic cycle. And I – we were an outlier. And I think that we're even in a better position this time around,
applying our credit philosophy to an even broader diversification in terms of markets that we cover.
And I think that we have great bankers. We have a very disciplined sales management process. We have credit
officers in the field. We use data analytics and the tools we put into place to manage credit risk. We look at trends
within the portfolio. Our credit team, the analytics side of it is very sophisticated. We use all of that to kind of guide
us. And if you look at the exposures that we had going into the pandemic, hospitality, for example, Gary and his
team had already managed down those exposures. We have less than $300 million in exposure. And we kind of
looked at that portfolio and looked at what was going on in the industry and set thresholds based upon our capital
levels. We looked at all of our exposures relative to capital and made adjustments and get it in a way that didn't –
that we weren't exiting customers left and right. We just decided we were going to swallow up our lending in that
category and we had enough to go after geographically to continue to sustain the growth trajectory for the
company. That's how you manage risk through a cycle.
The other side of it is we're very focused on what's happening with our customer base. I mean we're looking at the
supply chain issues. How is that going to impact growth and EBITDA margin growth, it's really if the company has
more leverage. We look at that. We look at interest rate sensitivity. How will rising rates impact certain portfolios.
We look at changes that are going on from a commodity pricing perspective and how that will impact customers,
and then we pick what we think are great management teams to lend to. And it sounds pretty basic but if you stick
to that and you don't grab -we don't; we manage pipelines and we manage opportunities. We're not, at this early,
managing growth and portfolios just to grow. So, I think the outcome is we ended up, as we've always said, with
mid- to high-single digit growth in the portfolio and that's not to sustain us and to achieve on our principal
investment piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right. That's the strategy. And in the markets that we cover, you could see some really substantial population
growth in the Southeast. There's a lot of activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly in DC, in Portland and
Maryland. We have Pittsburgh and then Cleveland that have bigger industrial bases where we see more
opportunities on the C&I side and Charleston, South Carolina is a high-growth market. We've had great
opportunities there to land principally in the real estate space but we also see C&I opportunities there more and
more because of the changes that are going on there.
Anyway, that's how we manage the risk. And I can't say that I'm looking at a single – but we stay out of – we're
not an equity-sponsored lender. We don't just follow private equity perspective of what's going on. So we try to
stay out of those riskier portfolios. We have sold portfolios even at times when we could have used the earning
assets on the balance sheet because we were concerned about the risk, so very prudently managed. I think I

have all the confidence in the world in our team and I believe we'll be able to grow just like we have in other
cycles. I hope that helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. No, it is. Thanks for expanding on it. I appreciate that. And then just secondly for me I mean you guys are
kind of in this enviable position here where the loan-to-deposit ratio is still low and your cash is still almost 7% of
your earning assets, right, where we've seen some of your peers are starting to see some upward pressure on the
loan-to-deposit and were a little bit quicker deploy that cash elsewhere; whether it was loans or bonds. But I
guess longer-term, right, I mean it's hard to be competitive from a profitability standpoint with so much, with an
80% loan-to-deposit, 7% of earning assets in cash, right? So I mean how do you guys think about that dynamic? I
mean obviously those are good things to have with the uncertain environment but presumably at some point they
need to normalize like the ROE that I think you guys can't. So I mean how do you guys think about the timing of
that evolution of the balance sheet just given everything that's going on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, we've achieved pretty substantial profitability metrics at 97% of loan-to-deposit ratio, so I'm not sure. It really
depends on the interest rate environment and what's happened kind of globally. But I will tell you that our
consumer bank, what differentiates us from many of our peers is they're principally commercial banks. It's much,
much harder to grow deposits at certain points in the cycle when you're relying solely on commercial depositors.
So we – again, diversification, we have a big chunk of our deposit base which sits in the consumer bank and
we've had great success growing those deposits and the betas in those categories tend to be more favorable to
the bank. So I think that's – we plan on continuing to pursue that, to pursue those strategies that we put out there.
With our investment in technology, the eStore, the number of deposit accounts that we're opening online has
gone up fairly significantly over time. So, our scalability in that consumer segment actually has improved, right?
So, I think we're in a good position to grow deposits, which I think is how banks should be measured. Good banks
can grow their deposit base in a favorable way. That's what makes them great. So, we focus on it and try to
achieve better results and that's really a principal funding source for us.
I don't know if you want to add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just add – I mean the spot cash, if you look at it at the end of the quarter was about 4% of earning
assets. I think Vince has made a reference point to 97%. So 97% was kind of our high mark for loan-to-deposit
ratio. There's a lot of room between here and there. So I think with the deployment of the cash in the short run
and then like Vince said, our ability to generate deposits, the geography we had and not just through acquisition
but through de novo, the bankers we've added, Treasury management team is out there getting wins every day, I
think that differentiated for us, so that helps the fund the loan growth. But in the short run, we have the benefit of
the cash and deposit growth continuing as we go forward with adding new accounts, not just what we have on the
balance sheet today, that clearly benefit us for the long run.

Good morning, Russ.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Just a brief follow-up on the deposit beta conversation. I appreciate your views as to where things could shake out
by the end of the year and likely the bulk of fed hikes will begin by that time. But as the later ones work their way
through, do you have an updated view on sort of through-the-cycle betas from a total and interest-bearing
perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. Well, I think we have the reference point that we had in the prepared remarks to give you kind of a feel for
that. [indiscernible] (00:44:45).

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. So, I mean. Sorry. So, I mean, Russell, that's one reference point that we have. And kind of getting to what
we're suggesting into our guidance for the end of the year, depending on who you believe, I mean the fed kind of
peaks in third quarter and then starts to come down from there. So, I think what happened to the beta from there
is going to be kind of interesting and for us to all manage.
14


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Once rates start to come back down, what happens to the beta is relative where deposit rates are at that time
relative to where kind of the fed has moved to. So our job is to balance it and manage it effectively. I think that
year-end point is a good reference point to have relative to what happened last time and we'll do our best to try to
even be better than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's helpful, Vince. Thank you. And then, just another follow-up sort of on the asset quality conversation.
Appreciate your thoughts there. Results are really strong. Historically, a lower beta model at F.N.B., but as you've
moved into growth with markets and increased the growth profile of the company, has your view changed at all in
terms of normalized losses and where you think that range of charge-offs could shake out over the next year or
two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would tell you, Russell, with our philosophy of consistent underwriting through the cycles, which we've
gone through a number of cycles at this point as you know, I would expect that our charge-offs and with the
diversity of the book and the amount of credit opportunities that we're seeing and choosing the highest quality
opportunities in that list, I would expect to see our normalized charge-offs be lower than they were in the past. We
have taken some positions to move some positions from a balance sheet standpoint. And with the consistency
that we've seen and the high-quality opportunities we've seen, I would expect them to be slightly lower through
the cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thank you for that, Gary. And then, just last one for me is a follow-up on the loan growth discussion. Vince, you
mentioned just kind of a longer term mid to high-single digits, but just getting back into the change in the growth
profile, the growth of your markets, trying to balance that against some of the macro headwinds outlined earlier, is
a high-single-digit result something that you think is sustainable in the near term just even beyond the back half of
this year just given that diversification and growth of your markets? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's a good question. I wish I knew the answer. I think as we look at it – honestly as we look into the next year,
it's going to be, I think, a little more challenging. I'm not sure how much capital will be deployed by customers or
consumers, depending on what's happening with the US economy. As things stand today, it looks like and based
on what I'm reading, seeing all the other banks report, there was kind of pent-up demand for credit. So, kind of the
flood just came in. But I think there's a lot of uncertainty within the customer base about where we're headed.
So, there's a lot more caution, at least I'm sensing that. This is anecdotal. I'm sensing there's a lot more caution
within the customer base about capital investment moving into next year. So, my expectation would be that we
had great results from those two quarters from a growth perspective. The pipelines looked good. They're lower
slightly because we did fund quite a bit. But then, I'm trying to think what's going to happen as we move forward?
Well, that's really a question about confidence, confidence within the customer base, how our customers feel,
particularly the commercial customers, both CRE and C&I on -if the environment is going to be ripe for a capital
investment. I mean they're going to look at that and say that's going to drive [indiscernible] (00:49:19)

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
We've seen a little bit of benefit from the supply chain issues quite frankly. Some of the customers are trying to
deal with inventory shortfalls, so they're starting to borrow a little bit. We saw a slight uptick in utilization rates.
Some of that is having a little extra inventory on-hand so they can continue to grow, right, because their supply
chain issues that put a lid on growth with those companies, so they are trying to manage that. You see commodity
pricing, they pushed up some of the revolvers a little bit because the cost of raw materials has gone up pretty
dramatically for most industries.
All of that's going to come into play. But I think demand for loans, commercial loans in particular should – I think
will tail off a little bit. We saw the flood come in and then next year is a big question mark based upon how we're
feeling later in the year collectively. I hope that helps. That's – we just – we manage it. Frequently we manage it
credit-by-credit, group-by-group. So we have prospect lists and the falling activity and we just try to be there for
the clients. So, when the capital opportunity comes up, we're one of the considered banks and deliver. So hope
that helps.

Well, the commercial pipelines that we just went through it; the enormous funding session. So what ends up
happening is the short-term pipeline converts the assets on the balance sheet and then the long-term pipeline
starts to fill back up again. We look at it in two segments: Within 90 days to close and greater than 90 days really
with few principal areas.
But when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, considering the growth we've had which is mostly seasonal, our
pipelines aren't low historically, they're lower than they were at the beginning of the quarter slightly. So let me be
clear: There's still opportunities within the pipeline. We've cleared out the 90-day bucket with good fundings.

thinking about the near-term, kind of what's repricing. Just remind us. I thought that there was not much that had

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Yeah. I would say higher. I mean [indiscernible] (00:52:55) has a lot of moving parts. We gave guidance on
margins in cash levels and all the [indiscernible] (00:52:59). So, the dollars in net interest income I think they're
the most helpful. The floors are really insignificant. I mean it's under $100 million of [indiscernible] (00:53:09) not
even something we talk about.
If you look at some of the key drivers, remember Brian that in the – we still have that excess cash on the balance
sheet and we have a slide there that quantifies that. I mean that's a 16-basis point drag on the margin in the
second quarter. So with that cash continues to get deployed that 16 basis points will go away. So again
directionally that helps the percentage.
The purchase accounting and PPP benefits are 3 basis point and 1 basis point respectively that's going the other
way. They're very low at this point and PPP will [indiscernible] (00:53:48) and the purchase accounting, I will
probably say around that level. So, that 16 basis point drag goes away with benefit to the percentage for sure.
Some of the other kind of key drivers that we talked about in the past is the consumer CDs. We bought about [ph]
1.75 to 2.25 (00:54:08) a month that are maturing from 22 basis points to 43 basis points. And today in the month
of June where we are, we're kind of CDs on around 60, 65, 70 basis points. So there's that dynamic there.
If you look at the portfolio rate on the CDs, we were 67 basis points at the end of December, bottomed at 55 basis
points in April and ended June at 63 basis points. So still at a very low rate, but it's definitely kind of bottomed and
started to move up a little bit just given the commercial and municipal side of the house with some pricing
adjustments that we've made there. And then I guess the last piece I would comment is just the new loans made
during the second quarter and those came out at [ph] 3.79 (00:54:56) for the second quarter. That was [ph] 3.09
(00:54:58). So that's a nice move up and it's also about the portfolio rate. So kind of some of the other drivers I
would comment on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. No, that's helpful. And maybe just last one just on the on the fee income side of the house, maybe
just – can you talk about just kind of where some of the greatest opportunities are here with the two acquisitions
and then maybe just kind of the mortgage outlook? I mean I guess when you look at kind of this quarter's level, is
this kind of a floor where that level is sustainable given kind of the trends you're seeing? You talked about the
refinance activity and just the origination activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say on the mortgage side, I guess a couple of comments. Yeah. We're down a $0.5 million from the first
quarter. The MSR valuation recovery down by $2.1 million, so the kind of underlying number was up $1.6 million,
but the absolute level obviously affected just by [ph] bank-stated mortgages (00:56:03) and rates having moved
up so much.
As you look into the next couple quarters, I mean our guidance has that [ph] 6-ish (00:56:09) number coming
down to the number that more as a four-handle to it just given kind of the expected activity within the year. That's
all that's all baked into our guidance.

that we've created to help us offset the slowing and we've got a fairly granular set of businesses that provides the
income for the company. I mean international banking has been doing pretty well. There are some stuff in the
pipeline for them. Capital markets, as I mentioned, is doing well. Syndications derivatives. While derivative we
thought which was lower. I think clients are trying to hedge the future interest rate risk so when that came in a little
better than we expected and I would expect there to be activity throughout the rest of the year in the interest rate
derivatives category and certainly management has done very well.

The other thing I would comment on too, Brian, is just looking in our slide, I mean the wealth management side of

having some really good success.
