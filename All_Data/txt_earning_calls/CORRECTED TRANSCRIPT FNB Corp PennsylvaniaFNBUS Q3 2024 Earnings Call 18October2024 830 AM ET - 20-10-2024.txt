Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer, and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB reported third quarter operating net income
available to common shareholders of $122 million or $0.34 per diluted common share after adjusting for $15
million of significant items impacting on. The third quarter's results demonstrate our ability to produce quality loans
and significant deposits throughout our footprint while maintaining stable non-interest bearing deposit balances of
approximately $10 billion. We generated linked quarter revenue growth, strengthened our balance sheet with the
record CET1 ratio of 10.4% and drove shareholder value with tangible book value growth of 15% year-over-year
and an operating return on average tangible common equity of 14%.
We are also particularly proud of our ability to gain market share in a number of MSAs across our footprint, and
achieved a number-two traditional retail deposit share position in Pittsburgh, despite competition from some of the
nation's largest banks. In this environment, it's important we continue to manage our capital and liquidity position.
During the quarter, FNB completed a $431-million indirect auto loan sale, allowing us to remove lower yielding
assets from our balance sheet with minimal impact to forward earnings while improving capital and the loan-to-
deposit ratio. Vince Calabrese will provide the details about the sale during his remarks. Total loans ended the
quarter at nearly $33.7 billion, a 4.6% annualized linked quarter increase when excluding the loan sale. FNB's
loan growth has once again exceeded the published H.8 data as we continue to gain market share.
This can be attributed to our business model and its emphasis on a diverse and attractive footprint, as well as
ample capital and liquidity to support our clients. Total deposits ended the quarter at $36.8 billion, an increase of
5.1%, or $1.8 billion from the second quarter, benefiting from new production that was generated through
successful deposit initiatives, as well as seasonal deposit inflows. Our strong sequential deposit growth highlights
the successful efforts of our commercial and business bankers to establish and deepen client relationships. We
also have leveraged our digital and data analytics capabilities to effectively market and capture deposits from new
and existing retail households through data-driven lead generation. We made strides in consumer and small
business deposits through our omnichannel Clicks to Bricks environment, leveraging our diversified geographic
branch footprint and award-winning eStore Common App.
Our loan-to-deposit ratio improved significantly to 91.7%, a decrease of nearly five percentage points from the last
quarter. This linked quarter change demonstrates our ability to execute strategies to manage the loan-to-deposit
ratio when needed. In the third quarter alone, FNB generated nearly $1.8 billion of deposits, completed a loan
sale and supported $391 million in loan growth. We will continue to manage the loan-to-deposit ratio through our
long-term strategy of being our customer's primary operating bank across both the consumer and commercial
portfolios, aided by our advanced digital tools, Clicks to Bricks strategy, and product bundling capabilities. This
quarter's total revenue growth of 2.3% was driven by an all-time high non-interest income of $90 million and
stronger net interest income levels.
We will further advance our strategy of diversifying revenue streams and leveraging ongoing investments,
including a focus on expanding business lines in our capital markets segment. Operating non-interest expense
totaled $234 million driven by higher salaries and benefits partially associated with strategic hiring necessary to
grow market share and our continued investment in our risk management infrastructure. We strategically
increased marketing expenses $2 million to support deposit initiatives that led to our robust deposit growth.
Expense management remains a high priority, and we expect fourth quarter expenses to be down sequentially.
Our ongoing expense management and growing diverse revenue streams led to a peer-leading efficiency ratio of
55.2% in the third quarter. Another area of ongoing focus is maintaining consistent and conservative underwriting
guidelines, enabling us to continuously serve our customers.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Over the last decade, our credit team has built a comprehensive framework to effectively and proactively manage
credit risk in concentrations through various economic cycles. This long-standing approach to credit risk
management continues to serve us well.
With that, I will now pass the call to Gary to review the overall credit performance. Gary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter with our asset quality metrics remaining at
stable levels. Total delinquency finished the quarter up slightly at 79 basis points or 15 bps from the prior quarter,
with NPLs and OREO ending at 39 basis points, up to 6 bps. Net charge-offs totaled 25 basis points and 17 basis
points on a year-to-date basis, reflecting solid performance in the current economic environment. Criticized loans
were down 22 basis points on a linked quarter basis, reflecting improvement across the portfolio. Total funded
provision expense for the quarter stood at $22.9 million and covered charge-off. Our ending funded reserve
stands at $420 million, an increase of $1.4 million; ending at 1.25%, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter. When
including acquired unamortized loan discounts, our reserve stands at 1.34% and our NPL coverage position
remains strong at 352%, inclusive of the discounts.
The non-owner CRE portfolio credit metrics continue to remain at satisfactory levels with delinquency and NPLs
up slightly at 69 and 31 basis points respectively. The early-stage delinquency increase was primarily related to
several performing credits that had matured and were in documentation, a number of which were renewed in the
normal course of business after quarter-end and are now current. The NPL increase was driven by one credit that
was placed on non-accrual status. We remain committed to our strategy of proactively managing and reducing the
non-owner CRE exposure as reflected on page 11 of the earnings slide deck. On a monthly basis, we review
upcoming and previously resolved maturities, largest exposures, and market conditions for the various property
types across our footprint that we have communicated in the past.
As Vince mentioned, we believe our proactive approach to credit risk management allows us to quickly engage
our experienced special assets team when necessary, working with our customers to minimize any potential
losses. On a quarterly basis, we perform targeted reviews of various portfolios along with a full portfolio stress
test. Our stress testing results for this quarter have once again shown lower net charge-offs and stable provision
compared to the prior quarter's results with our current ACL covering approximately 90% of our projected charge-
offs in a severe economic downturn; again, confirming that our well-balanced loan portfolio enables us to
withstand various stressed economic scenarios. In closing, our credit metrics ended the quarter at solid levels and
our loan portfolio continues to remain stable. We continue to invest in credit risk management systems and staff
that align with our consistent underwriting and core credit philosophy.
Our tenured leadership strives to maintain experienced banking teams to enable the company to attain prudent
loan growth while proactively managing credit risk through various economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to
Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.

Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will focus on the third quarter's financial results, including details on
the indirect auto loan sale and walk through our guidance for the fourth quarter. Third quarter operating net
income totaled $122 million or $0.34 per share when excluding the $11.6 million loss on the indirect auto loan

sale and $3.7 million software impairment. $431 million of performing lower-yielding indirect auto loans were sold
as part of our ongoing balance sheet management strategies. Loan sale positively impacted the loan-to-deposit
ratio by approximately 120 basis points and the CET1 capital ratio by approximately 10 basis points. Excluding
the loan sale, total loans and leases increased $391.4 million or 1.2% linked quarter for a period-end balance of
$33.7 billion. Consumer loan growth of $299 million, excluding the loan sale, was led by residential mortgage
originations as volumes remained elevated given the pullback in mortgage rates during the third quarter.
Commercial loans and leases grew $93 million linked quarter, in line with our expectations given the significant
level of commercial loan closings in the second quarter and reflective of lower revolver balance. Total deposits
ended September at $36.8 billion, a robust increase of $1.8 billion or 5% linked quarter, benefiting from our
successful deposit initiatives which demonstrate the value of our granular deposit base across a very attractive
geographic footprint. Third quarter deposit growth was led by a $1.3 billion increase in interest-bearing demand
deposits and $783 million increase in time deposits. The mix of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits
totaled 27% at quarter end compared to 29% last quarter, reflecting the strong interest-bearing deposit growth
and non-interest-bearing deposit balances remaining fairly stable, around $10 billion.
Last quarter, I discussed our goal to reduce our loan-to-deposit ratio organically through slower loan growth and
deposit seasonality alongside several loan and deposit initiatives our team has implemented. Success of our
ongoing balance sheet management and deposit gathering initiatives led to a loan-to-deposit ratio of 91.7% at
September 30, nearly a 5 percentage point improvement from 96.5% at June 30. We expect the loan-to-deposit
ratio to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as deposit growth continues to be a strategic focus. Net interest
income totaled $323.3 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 2.4% from the prior quarter, primarily due to earning
asset yield increasing 8 basis points to 551, and higher loan balances, as well as a favorable mix shift in interest-
bearing liabilities as total borrowings decreased $1.6 billion or 28% linked quarter.
This was partially offset by the cost of interest-bearing deposits increasing 15 basis points to 3.08%, continued
growth in higher yielding deposit product balances. Third quarter's resulting net interest margin was 3.08%, stable
with the second quarter margin. Since the Fed began raising interest rates in March of 2022, our total cumulative
spot deposit beta equaled 40% on August 31, 2024, outperforming our peers through the rate hiking cycle. We
continue to manage our balance sheet towards a more neutral position as interest rates are lowered. Since the
Fed's decision to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September, we have strategically lower
deposit pricing on several deposit products, including our current CD and Money Market promotional offerings. At
quarter end, we have nearly $7 billion of non-maturity deposits that are currently priced at or above 4.25% and a
$7.7-billion CD portfolio with a nine-month duration and $2.9 billion maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024 at a
weighted average rate of 4.75%.
Additionally, we have $2.8 billion of short-term or floating rate borrowings, with an average rate of 5.15% and
around $1 billion of swaps that mature beginning in January of 2025, with rates between 75 and 100 basis points.
Turning to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income reached an all-time high of $89.7 million, a 2%
increase from the prior quarter. Capital markets income increased $1.1 million, with broad-based contributions
from syndications, net capital markets, customer swap activity and international banking. Mortgage banking
operations income decreased $1.4 million from the strong levels in the prior quarter, driven by net MSR
impairment of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, due to accelerating prepayment speed assumptions, given
recent declines in mortgage rates, offsetting the increase in saleable production volumes.
Total income increased $3.1 million, reflecting higher life insurance claims. Operating non-interest expense
totaled $234.2 million, an $8.4-million increase from the prior quarter after adjusting for the significant items. The
largest driver for operating expense was a $5.1-million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to
5

production-related variable compensation, and lower salary deferrals, even reduced on balance sheet mortgage
production, as well as strategic hiring associated with our focus to grow market share and continued investments
in our risk management infrastructure. Marketing expense increased $2 million, tied to the timing of opportunistic
marketing campaigns for successful deposit initiatives. We continue to manage our expense base in a disciplined
manner. As we prepare our 2025 budget, we are working on a number of cost-saving initiatives to bring revenue
and expense growth into better balance.
With some of the incremental expense growth tied to revenue growth, the efficiency ratio remains at a peer-
leading level of 55.2% for the third quarter, up slightly from 54.4% last quarter. FNB's capital levels reached all-
time highs with a tangible common equity ratio at 8.2% and CET1 ratio at 10.4%, providing flexibility to deploy
capital and create shareholder value. On a year-over-year basis, tangible book value per common share
increased $1.31, or 15% to $10.33, demonstrating our commitment to internal capital generation. Let's now look
at the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. Loans are expected to grow mid-single digits on a full year basis,
inclusive of the loan sale. Total projected deposit balances are expected to grow mid-single digits on a year-over-
year basis, up from the previous expectation of low-single digits.
Our projected fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be between $310 million and $320 million,
assuming a 25 basis point rate cut in November, and another 25 basis point rate cut in December. Given the
continued strength of our non-interest income generation, the fourth quarter expectation is between $85 million
and $90 million. We anticipate fourth quarter non-interest expense to be lower than the third quarter level and
we're guiding to a range of $225 million to $235 million. Fourth quarter provision is expected to be between $20
million and $30 million, dependent on net loan growth and charge-off activity. Lastly, the full year effective tax rate
should be between 21% and 22%, which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur. As
we have previously mentioned, renewable energy financing transactions are part of our leasing company
business model, with deals in various stages and sizes in the pipeline with uncertainty on when the recognition of
the investment tax credit will occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Thank you, Vince. FNB's success includes the deep relationships we build within our communities. On behalf of
FNB, I want to offer our support to those impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton, including our fellow team
members, customers and neighbors. FNB continues to work with partners in the affected areas to support
recovery and healing in the coming days, weeks and months. We encourage our customers who were directly
impacted by the hurricanes to reach out if they require assistance. FNB's strong reputation is evident in the top
deposit share we hold in markets throughout our footprint. We deepened our penetration as we grew or
maintained deposits in nearly 90% of our MSAs over the past year, with FNB now ranking in the top-five in nearly
50% of the MSAs we operate in, across seven states. Our performance once again garnered recognition with
additional national and regional awards this quarter for our workplace culture, diversity to inclusion and client
experience.
Notably, we received global recognition as one of TIME's World's Best Companies; Newsweek's designation as
one of America's Most Admired Workplaces; in Global Finance Magazine's best bank for small and medium sized
enterprises in the mid-Atlantic. Our performance also conveys the quality of our workforce. We focus on hiring
and retaining the most talented and experienced individuals. Our investment in our workforce enables us to scale
effectively. In fact, 90% of our senior management team has larger institution and/or public accounting experience
and bring a wealth of knowledge to our risk management, operation and revenue-generating areas. As I've often

stated on these calls, the high caliber of our employees translates directly to stakeholder value. FNB's successful
navigation through various economic cycles is directly [ph] correlated (00:22:01) to our diverse and experienced
team.
Their ability to effectively grow revenue, mitigate risk, optimize our balance sheet, and execute on our proven
strategies, result in our ongoing success. I thank our teams for their dedication, and our shareholders for their
support.
Thank you. And we will now open the call up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time we will pause
momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. You know, obviously always a good time to be bringing in core deposits. But could you
just talk about the average rate you're seeing on these inflows? And Vince you mentioned, moving towards a
neutral – a more neutral interest rate position, wouldn't all this growth on the deposit side work against that a bit,
at least in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah I would say a couple of things. You know, as we said last quarter, we had significant growth in short term
borrowings to fund this very strong loan growth that we had in the second quarter. So the goal was to bring in
meaningful deposits, and we did. I mean, we brought in $1 billion of new money. In total, it was $1.8 billion – $1
billion of new money, around 4.25% at rate, and nature of those deposits are very short-term, combination of
Money Market and very short-term CDs, five-month CDs. So, we have a lot of flexibility as we move forward to
reduce the rates. On the liabilities we brought in, I think it positions us well from a loan-to-deposit ratio. We were
in the 96s; our goal was to bring it down and we brought it down meaningfully to 91.7%.
And if you look at kind of the balance sheet as a whole, as we sit here at the end of the quarter, we have $11
billion of liabilities that are repriceable today, subject to market forces, of course, about $11 billion. And we have
another $5.4 billion in CDs that mature in the next six months, $2.9 billion of that in the next three months at a
4.75% rate. And then we have $1 billion in cash flows from the investment portfolio that kind of rolls off around to
2.91% and they were investing between 4.25% and 4.50%. So, there's a lot of levers obviously there that help us
reprice. With the Fed moving 50 basis points in September, kind of bigger than maybe what was expected, that
has an impact on our loan portfolio over a three-month period. So, we'll be kind of playing some catch-up there,
but we have the levers here that can kind of offset that. And our team is very well-positioned and we've already
started to bring interest rates down. We brought rates down 50 basis points on our CD offer and a variety of
different deposit categories.
7


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
We've started to bring rates down and kind of ready to continue to bring rates down. So, I said a lot there, but we
have – feel that we have the levers positioned well moving forward so that we can kind of adjust as rates move
down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right. Okay. And then you were – I think FNB was a bank that was pretty conservative in your expectations of
deposit beta on the way down, at least I mean in the first few rate cuts. So, just wondering now that we've seen
that 50 basis points, you mentioned, you've already cut – you have cut some deposit rates, any updated thoughts
on what a sort of early deposit beta could look like for these first few cuts through the end of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say our guidance has obviously the 50 basis point plus two more 25 basis point cuts kind of baked
into that. What our guidance implies is like a 15% beta by the end of this year. I'd like to think we can do better
than that. Let's say we're all – everybody is geared up to be able to adjust prices. A lot of our competitors have
been lowering rates so that there's an ability to do that. So, kind of what's baked in is 15% and our goal would be
to do better than that by the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just lastly, on the indirect auto sale just kind of thoughts on additional opportunities on the
balance sheet here. Was any of this kind of moving the credit box a little bit or – and at this point, are you looking
to just exit this business, given the yields?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We're not looking to exit the business. We, we saw an opportunity for us to move some low-yielding assets
off the balance sheet was not a credit play. It was more about managing the overall balance sheet and particularly
– in particular, our loan-to-deposit ratio. We looked at it basically with our deposit – with our ability to generate
deposits and coupled with the sale of those loans, we were able to bring it down fairly substantially. And there
were some questions in the last earnings call about our ability to do that, and our ability to grow deposits in this
competitive environment. I think we proved that we're capable of doing those two things. I would say that in the
normal course of business, in that indirect auto portfolio, there will be loan sales from time to time. We've always
used to this kind of a way to manage the balance sheet and manage our loan-to-deposit ratio. It's you know,
we've done it a number of times, but we retain the servicing, so we're still maintaining the clients.
We do use the information on those clients to try to cross-sell other services to them. So, that works pretty well for
us. But it's not – it was not a credit play.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's a very short-term asset. I mean, two-year life to it. So from an income statement standpoint, given the
borrowings we paid off, there's really no impact on earnings, on a go forward basis. And it – it add – added capital
CET1 ratio, we picked up 10 basis points and just that alone added 100 or reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio by
120 basis points. So, it's attractive [indiscernible] (00:28:49).

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's an attractive transaction and you know it helps with capital and essentially puts us in a much better position to
support our clients. I think loan demand will pick up. Just based on the earnings calls that I've listened to and read
about, it seems like credit is more benign than folks would have thought and the economic environment is a little
better. I think there's a lot of wait and see right now. Once we get past the election, I do think irrespective of who
wins there'll be demand in the C&I book in particular, so we want to be positioned to take advantage of that. And I
think, Frank, the other thing is on display here over the course of the past year and during this last quarter, great
financial institutions are able to fund themselves and they're able to generate deposit balances. And we've talked
about our business model, we've talked about leveraging data analytics and how we're positioned in the markets
and the prominence that we have in the markets, our share in the markets.
There have been a lot of – there's been a lot of talk among some of the larger bank CEOs about the inability for
mid-sized and regional banks to gain share; we've proven that wrong. So, our business model works; we've
grown share. If you look at Pittsburgh, I mentioned it, we passed up the legacy Mellon Bank franchise here with
deposit share. So – just in the last turn, and those are real customer deposits, so we're doing very well in regard
to acquiring names. We're doing well at becoming the primary client, which is why our demand deposit balances
have been sustained at around $10 billion; others have seen migration at a much faster pace. All the things we've
said that are embedded in our business model have proved out in this quarter, so I just want to emphasize that.
And I know we've said it over and over again; I think the proof is in the results.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
...start on – good morning, guys. On expenses, if you could just revisit 3Q results for a minute, what the drivers
were that took you guys to the high end of the prior guide and then provide some color around the bracket for 4Q.
Is that simply tethered to fees or what could keep you towards the higher end of that range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. Expenses on an operating basis for the quarters came in at $234 million. The guidance range we provided
in July was $220 million to $230 million. The key drivers to that were a couple things. $2 million increase in
marketing which we decided to do to grow the $1.8 billion in deposit, so that was something that we – obviously
was a strategic decision to spend some more money on marketing, bring in the deposits and it worked very well.
And then $5 million increase in comp benefits, that was driven by a few things. Higher production-related
incentives, the success we've been having on the non-interest income side; there's commissions related to that,
deposit raising and the fee income. We mentioned in the release opportunistically hiring some producers in some
key markets for us and investing in risk management staff just to support our continued growth. And then just for
fun, we had an extra work day in the third quarter that's another $1 million.
So, those were kind of the drivers to get us a little bit above the range. But if you look at the efficiency ratio, we
continue to post top-quartile results. I mean, last quarter we were 54.4% which we were the third best among our
21-bank peer group. This quarter is 55.2% and I think we'll compare well again. And then, as you go ahead to the
fourth quarter, so we're using a range of $225 million to $235 million, up $5 million from the prior guidance, but –
and it's a few things. Continued variable compensation supported the strong non-interest income; seasonally
slower loan production; in effect, the FAS-91 cost deferrals would be lower; FDIC insurance levels kind of staying
at a higher level and then the impact of the hiring. But, you step back overall, the absolute level in fourth quarter,
we expect it to be down from the third quarter which is key.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. That's a great color, Vince. I appreciate it. And then, maybe just looking forward or taking that
conversation forward. You guys remarked about bringing revenue and expense growth into balance. So, as we
look to 2025, is positive operating leverage something you guys expect to be able to deliver? Or do we really
need to see a Fed easing cycle and deposit cost catch up to drive the efficiency more meaningfully lower and
deliver positive operating leverage for 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No. I would say obviously getting to a more positive slope yield curve later next year will make a difference, so I
think having it for some portion of 2025 versus 2024 is definitely achievable. But I think having that yield curve will
be kind of the key driver of getting us there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Having an appropriate slope in the curve drives our – if you look at our balance sheet and how we're
positioned, we perform extraordinarily well in that environment. So, that is key to our success, obviously, in that
we're no different than other banks. But if you look, that's the ultimate scenario for us in terms of profitability. So,
hopefully, we see some adjustments on the short end of the curve [ph] against (00:34:51) the slope of the curve
and the appropriate position for us to benefit.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Understood, and then just last one for me. You guys reiterated a mid-single-digit growth guide for the
year. As you guys look forward, is there any optimism for being able to accelerate that pace? Or are we – should
we be thinking about headwinds like paydowns or potential additional portfolio exits that would keep you guys at a
mid-single-digit [ph] clip (00:35:31)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't think we're in a position right now. We haven't given guidance for next year, but I would look back
historically. I think we've done a very good job over a long period of time. I've been here for almost 14 years in
this seat, 19 years overall. I think we've grown loans and deposits just about every year I've been here. Maybe the
pandemic was a time when loans didn't grow one quarter, but we've put up pretty consistent organic loan growth.
It's in the mid to high single-digit irrespective of the size of the balance sheet over time. And as we've grown the
balance sheet, we shifted our strategy to move into markets that would provide us with opportunities, right, so we
could sustain our growth trajectory irrespective of the size of the balance sheet. So, I think that's played out over
time. So, I'm – I can't say I'm optimistic because there's so much uncertainty about next year, but I do believe that
we're in the best position of anyone to generate that loan growth once the market comes back, demand picks up
in a way that is a growth scenario, put it that way.

Good morning, Timur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...the deposit acquisition strategy, just looking at the new money cost this quarter at 4.25%, I mean, that's still
dilutive to the overall rate. I'm just wondering as we look into 4Q and I had just the composition of the deposit
growth and the 50 basis point reduction in CDs, is that off of that 4.25% level or is new money acquisition still
north of 4% here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I don't think we're going to get into specific strategies around how we price so that our competitors don't
listen in. But I will tell you that you've got to look at it in total. While that is the new money rate coming in, that's
basically on the Money Market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's Money Market and five-month CDs, so, sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, yeah, CDs and the Money Market that are driving that. There is a component of demand deposit, there's a
run-off now or shift in mix, but we are bringing in primary clients. So, we do have operating accounts as well that
have the rebalances. So, I would expect us to be able to benefit as we move along. And then I also would note,
based upon your comment that it's not accretive, it actually – we replace short-term borrowings that were at a
much higher rate...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[ph] Much higher (00:38:32).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
They were 5%, so it actually was beneficial. So, the way I look at it, Scott and I go back and forth depending on
the interest rate environment – Scott's our treasurer. I basically say, hey, I'd rather have clients, new clients, than
rely on wholesale funding or some other source of funding that's institutional in nature. So, this trade was actually
a very good trade for our shareholders.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah bringing loan-to-deposit ratio down as much as it did, gives us the flexibility to be able to actively reprice rest
of the portfolio. So, there's...

And I'm going to say it again because in the context of the competitive environment we're in, we are not outsized
from a pricing standpoint relative to our competitors. So, our business model is working and we are driving share
in the market in a way that is accretive to our margin and our profitability. So – and over time, having new clients,
we have the flexibility to price according to changes in the market. So, it ultimately leads to higher profitability on a
per-client basis as well. Anyway, that's the strategy behind what we accomplished.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah I would just add one last thing, too, is we have a meaningful pipeline on the commercial side of additional
deposit accounts that we're going after and pursuing. And we've had great success in the past quarter and there's
still a very meaningful amount that we're going after to bring in new relationships.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. That's great color there. And then just maybe, again, circling back to the auto sale or indirect
auto loan sales, just any kind of underlying characteristics of the loans sold? I guess, how did you choose which
portions of that portfolio were divested this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I'll let Gary answer that question because that actually reports up through Gary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Timur, it is just a across-the-board sample of current transactions in the portfolio. That portfolio sale did not
include any account that was past due. So it was high-FICO, high-quality paper with an average life of two years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then just lastly for me, there's been some growing speculation of mid-Atlantic M&A, your name
kind of into the mix. Just would love to get an update as to what your thoughts are around capital deployment
going forward and where M&A might fit into that mix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Okay. We haven't changed our position. We've indicated in the past that we are not looking to deliver tangible
book value in a material way. I don't think that – I don't want to comment on specific transactions, but we're still
focused on doing deals in-market, smaller in size, if that was even available to us, we're being opportunistic in
terms of what's out there. So, in-market acquisitions with cost saves are on the list. The deals would have to be
immediately accretive to earnings with limited tangible book value dilution, as I've said, and then the return has to
be well above our cost of capital. So, no, I don't think we've deviated at all and there are a lot of rumblings out
there, but we're going to stay true to our strategy. I think it's – we've done well over the last few years, focusing on
tangible book value accretion and returns, and that's going to be our focus as we move forward.

Good morning Dan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just starting on the 4Q guidance for NII, for net interest income, just some clarification trying to get a sense
for what the margin compression could look like to fit into your guidance. Is there – on the balance sheet side, is
there something that was in the third quarter in terms of the pace of growth that would impact the average
balances in fourth quarter? Is that something where you – you could see that number come down? Just trying to
think about rightsizing how to get to the margin number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think it goes back to what I said earlier, Danny, about the implied beta that's in there, right? So, the Fed moved
50 basis points in September and we only had a partial month impact of that. So you have the full quarter's impact
of that, and then there's two more 25s. So, I think there's some conservatism in our NII guide, but we're using a
15% beta by the end of the year. We can do better than that and there's upside to that. We don't have any other
portfolio exits or anything like that teed up as we sit here today. So, we'll just be kind of normal activity. For fourth
quarter, like Vince said earlier, there's some seasonality to some slower activity. And then you have the
uncertainty with the election and everything. So, no, there's still some level – our mid-single digit guidance on the
loan side is still the same guidance that we've been giving. So there's nothing unusual. It's just us managing the
rates down we get between now and the end of the year.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Understood. So the average earning assets likely increase in the fourth quarter and it's a margin issue in
the fourth quarter before we start to see that stabilize at some point next year; is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes. And I would just say that – I would characterize the margin as flattish. I mean, if it's down, it's down a few
basis points, not a lot. So, just a starting comment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe one for Gary on the kind of the credit environment,
specifically, just net charge-off environment, obviously, you got volatility a little bit higher in the third quarter. But
just interested in your current thoughts around how you think about what might be a good run rate for net charge-
offs for the bank as you think about the next – the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You know, Daniel I think that we're very aggressive from a risk management standpoint and staying ahead of our
clients with information flow, and understanding their position and the risks in the portfolio. We've continued to
perform exceptionally well from a risk management and a charge-off perspective. And all the credit metrics have
been at or near record low levels for quite some time now. This quarter we were 25 bps, on a year-to-date basis,
17 basis points, which is really, really strong result in this environment which continues to be a bit uncertain. And
as we all know, the CRE environment is truly continuing to see some stress here. So, I would expect continued
performance as we have put up over the last number of years and is it going to edge up a touch? I mean, it may
normalize, but I feel very good about where we sit, and as we look ahead, continuing to outperform from the
industry's perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Gary and his team have done a fantastic job of making sure that the risk ratings are current. So, he mentioned
gathering the information. I think that where we stand today is where we're going to stand tomorrow, basically with
the exception of any major shifts in the global economic environment. So, we're not going to be sitting here with
surprises, let's put it that way. We do a pretty thorough job of underwriting and assessing risk ratings on a
frequent basis, stress-testing and evaluating risk. So, what you see is what you get. And I think that's a – that's
been true for a very long time for us. And Gary has done a fantastic job, so – keeping us there.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. I hate to beat a dead horse, but I just want to button up
a few more things on the margin. On the prepared commentary about the 15% beta by the end of the year, just a
point of clarification, wondering if that's interest-bearing or total deposit beta, one; and then two, I know you
haven't done the budget for next year, but just from a high level, wondering how you anticipate deposit betas on
the way down more broadly as you look ahead past this next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, that 15% Kelly is total deposit beta by the end of the year. And we've talked about historically kind of a mid-
30s level on the down, kind of – we have some statistics we look at from the past cycle. So, that's kind of what's in
our head. So, I don't know, by the end of next year could be around 30-ish, I would say, kind of as a level total,
again, total deposit beta by the end of next year is kind of what's in our heads at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the loan side of things, just wondering what you're seeing in your markets
and in terms of how spreads might be holding up for commercial loans, and if you're seeing any differences
between how that's performing in the Carolina markets versus into your more legacy mid-Atlantic markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Surprisingly, it's fairly consistent across the board and you would expect it to be different regionally, as your
question implies, but it has been fairly consistent. I think with Capital exiting the CRE space, there's a little more
pricing flexibility in that bucket. You know, if you find a high-quality CRE opportunity, you're able to get a little
more margin out of it today. That's a function of banks pulling back and financial non-banks pulling back as well.
So, I would say there's not a lot of demand from a C&I perspective kind of across the board right now.
Everything's on hold. I would expect that to change as we move into next year. I don't have a crystal ball, but my
gut and 30 years of experience tells me that there's quite a bit being held back. So, I would suspect that moving
into next year, we'll be able to see a higher level of demand, particularly for C&I. I expect that to happen.
And then on the consumer side, I – consumer home equity and direct installment's been pretty benign. I would
expect that to pick up a little bit as well. And our mortgage company has done a remarkable job of gaining share
pretty much across the board. So, we would continue to, I hope, continue to succeed there. I don't know if that
answers your question, but it – it's pretty...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's interesting. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the expense, again, I know it's too early to start
talking about next year, but one thing you have talked about is the double carry of the rent expense with the build-
out of the new headquarters. Just wondering the timing of that, if that's still kind of on track to – I think it was about
$7 million come out of next year as you move over to the new space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I don't know that it's actually $7 million, but it – the building's on track. We're scheduled to move in on
November 25, I think is the date. I think we picked the worst possible Thanksgiving. I don't know what it is. But it's
– that's when we'll all be moving over there. You know, we'll have nearly 800 employees moving into one location.
We're in seven buildings here on the north side of Pittsburgh, we're scattered all over the place. If – I think we'll
eke out efficiency just by being together in productivity. Our people are in the office pretty much, so I think that will
help us immensely. That rent that we talk about, that's basically because we had a year of free rent, right? So,
that gets built – baked into the total length of the lease, gets carried out over the lease according to GAAP
accounting. And we still have rent expense in this building, so that's why that's occurring if you've forgotten.
So, I would expect that to come back. Portion of that $7 million, it's not the total amount, but a portion of it will be
coming back next year. Now, there might be demand for additional space. It's going to be hard to see. I can't lay
that out apples-to-apples, but theoretically yes, we should be receiving a benefit from a GAAP accounting
perspective. The other rent is non-cash.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Hey, Brian.

Hey, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, it's just one question just on the – going back to the deposits for a minute, Vince, and the success of this
quarter. The DDA did come down a bit, and I know you guys have talked about kind of being the primary bank for
your customers and then also the new commercial, Vince, you talked about that you see opportunities on. I mean,
does that – I guess, is your expectation that that stabilization in that level is still kind of a way to think about the
DDA as you kind of look at the next couple quarters here, at that 27% level? Or do you see it drifting lower from
where it's at today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Look, the mix moved down. Obviously, we're in a period where you see some outflows in the demand deposit
category, plus we brought on a lot of new money so it's going to shift. But we've been running at around $10
billion pretty consistently, so you saw as rates went up we were able to maintain that. I believe as rates come
down we should be able to maintain it and grow it over time. So, I can't speak to the overall. If you look at the total
deposits and you look at demand deposits as a percentage of the total, sure, it's going to be smaller. But that $10
billion in non-interest-bearing deposits has really been beneficial to us. And if you look at our cost of funds overall
and compare it to peers, we can match up pretty well. So, that's the main reason. So, I would say we have
opportunities to grow the non-interest-bearing category because as customers grow and we brought new clients
on, and we're able to stand up all the Treasury management services in these balances to pay for services where
they're dispersing funds out of operating accounts that we have, we'll have a pickup in demand deposits over
time.
But there's still – it's a very difficult environment to maintain demand deposits because anybody that has excess
balances is looking to get a higher yield, right? [indiscernible] (00:56:02) versus where we were during the
pandemic when everything was close to zero, right? There's nowhere to go. So – but I think we've done well and I
would expect us to continue to do well in that category.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I was going to say, Brian, we also saw about a 1% reduction in revolver balances which also is going to
impact DDA balances, moving from the DDA to pay down some debt as customers, being cautious during these
times with everything that's going on in the election on top of us, did make some decisions to pay down some
revolver balances. So, there's a slight impact there as well.

relationships. And that's been a focus over time really, to be the full bank for our customers.

bit more than maybe people thought. Any pickup in just dialogue with your customers, kind of getting the sense
that there's that optimism for next year on the loan growth side? And I know you guys will give more color next
quarter, but it seems like a handful of people, other banks have said that first rate cut really dispersed some new
interest from their customers. And didn't sound like you were getting that sense yet, maybe the election and
getting past a few things here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I'm not as close to the customers as I used to be. But interacting with the bankers and talking with some of the
clients, I'm not seeing that yet, to be honest. I think it's still kind of let's wait and see. And they're expecting
additional costs, so there may be dialogue but they're thinking, hey, I'm going to get a much better opportunity
down the road here because everybody is signaling that there will be additional rate cuts, right? So, I'm not seeing
everyone leaping forward and saying I'm going to take advantage of this 50-basis point reduction. I think they're
kind of sitting back and saying, hey, let's see how the election plays out. But a lot of things can happen. Post-
election, corporate taxes are on the table. All kinds of things that impact our clients are on the table, so they're
going to sit back and say, hey, I want to wait and see what's happening, and that's kind of what I'm hearing and
seeing. And again, I don't have as much insight as maybe – I don't know, Gary, if you want to add anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Vince, I would agree with everything that you said. That's kind of the way it feels right at the moment. I would
expect, based on this period where we are here pre-election, that once we get into 2025 and the middle part of
the year, when things start getting quite active, that we'll see some stronger demand.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I've been out the last few months, Brian. I mean, I've been in Winston-Salem – I've been all over the place.
Winston-Salem, I've been in Ohio, around Pennsylvania, so I'm hearing the same thing; I'm not hearing anything
different.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But again, I don't have the picture. I mean, I might be getting biased information. I don't know.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. And maybe just one on the margin. It sounds like, and maybe just Vince can remind us what the immediate
– I think you went through some of the stuff that reprices, but the immediate on the loan side, what reprices. And
then, it just sounds as though, secondarily, the – I guess if you – maybe the expectation is to see a little bit of
pressure here on the margin, modest in the fourth quarter. And then, if you are neutral, I guess the expectation is
you can kind of keep the margin relatively stable. And then, as you get into next year and if you get the yield curve
steepening, you get some pick up later in the year. Is that, just in general, how to think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think you said it perfectly fine [indiscernible] (01:00:07). But to your initial question, slide 15 does a good
job laying out the moving parts. Just to remind everybody, that's 47.5% you see in the chart there, of the $33.7
billion, that reprices on the loan side over a three-month period. And as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the
levers that we have, we have $11 billion of liabilities that are repriceable today. We have another $5.4 billion in
CDs that will mature in the next six months, $2.9 million in the next three months at a 4.75% rate, and then $1
billion in cash flows in the investment portfolio that, it's coming off at 2.91% and being reinvested today at least
between 4.25% and 4.5%. So, that kind of gives you the key moving parts that are there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. Yeah. And then I think you mentioned Vince, or somebody mentioned on the call some hiring that
you guys had done on the – maybe on the fee income side, maybe just – if you can just point us to what you're
doing there. And then just one just modeling question. It sounds like the fee income this quarter, the BOLIs maybe
– I don't want call it non-recurring or – and then the – there was also a negative, you said on impairment on the
mortgage that...

Yeah, it was an MSR impairment of $2.8 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So they offset each other. If you look at...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q

Yeah, it's a offset. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...the fee income, Brian...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

No, it's not.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And then just the hiring that you've done, I guess there is an area you're focused on. Was it capital
markets, Vince, that you talked about as far as – I think there was some comment about hiring and I'm just trying
to understand where there might be more...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we've added – you know we've added folks – yeah, we replaced people. In certain markets we've up-tiered
with the replacements. You know, we had – that's one area that's driving a little bit of the increase in the salary
expense, so we've been able to bring some really talented people. And then we've been building out our risk
management framework and we stood up an operating efficiency group for our operations area because we felt
that with the changes that are going on with AI and our investment in our data hub, we're going to be able to drive
efficiency in operations. So, we hired – we made some changes. There was a press release that was put out, but
we brought in some very talented people, some process engineers to help us drive efficiency and improve
customer satisfaction and deal with risk in the back office. So, while that's not a front-end hire, that should benefit
us over the long haul.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And that's really what's embedded in the increase in the run rate of expenses, salary expenses. It's not as large
as the total amount that we're reporting because there's all kinds of pieces in there. Some of it's directly related to
production right higher production in those fee income areas. We're paying out commission. But I think we're
putting ourselves in a pretty good position moving into next year, both with funding, right, so if there is a pickup in
demand, keeping that funding short, short duration in our strategy, so we can reprice down, take advantage of the
changes in interest rates that occur, and then investing in areas that produce revenue and create efficiencies. So,
those are the factors that drove all of our decisions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. That should be it for me, and I guess, just remind me, from a sensitivity standpoint, are you guys –
you're pretty neutral, is that what I heard? I guess nothing's changed then on the sensitivity of where you guys are
at today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, I would say – I mean, we're still asset sensitive, but we're clearly moving towards neutral. I mean, all the
different levers I've talked about, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So if you looked at our 10-Q, it still shows asset sensitivity, but I would say we're more neutral than what the rate
calculations show and towards that. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q

Yeah. Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the question, guys.

[indiscernible] (01:04:30)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
So, a lot of my questions have been answered, but can you just dive a little bit more into where you're seeing the
market share gains in deposits, what geographies are driving it best and kind of where you expect continued
momentum?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we saw some fairly [indiscernible] (01:04:51) Carolinas was double-digit. You know I think that's one area
we've had great success. Pittsburgh, we continue to have success. I think because we have such a huge market
share here, it feeds on itself. I mean, we now have the scale to be able to compete effectively here and bring new
clients on and [ph] better (01:05:12) relationships. And that's still happening. So, that – we're benefiting there. In
the central part of Pennsylvania, we've done extraordinarily well. So we brought in [indiscernible] (01:05:23) there,
and then as you move into the mid-Atlantic region, we've had some success in the markets that we're expanding
into. And then also Charleston, South Carolina, and the South Carolina market that we're moving to [ph] should
get good (01:05:39) results for us.
Those are – it's pretty much – I guess it's pretty much everywhere. I think we've done well in a bunch of markets.
But I would say the Carolinas and the central part of Pennsylvania is probably leading the charge, right, and then
Pittsburgh.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we had growth in 35 of the 57 MSAs that we operate in and from a either increase share or maintain, it was
91% of the MSAs that we're in. So, I think yeah very good result. And then in the Carolinas, we had increases in
six of the markets that we're in there. So it was very [indiscernible] (01:06:12)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I was just referring to the increase quarter-on-quarter. I wasn't referring to...

...the market share data, but it's pretty consistent. It's pretty similar story.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
To shift for a second, if we do get significant rate cuts by middle of next year, what's kind of the fee upside we
see? You're gaining new relationships in the Carolinas. Could that convert quickly to improved mortgage
business? Can you just kind of talk about that? Fee upside with lower rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, the mortgage business really hinges on – for us, it hinges on demand because we're a big purchase money
lender. So, hopefully there's more housing supply out there, more people decide to sell. But I think that'll be good.
I think the swap income that we get from commercial customers – somebody else asked the question, I think it
was Brian, what are you seeing out there? One thing that I can tell you is that the customers that are looking to go
to a fixed rate swap, they're watching what's going on, and they're not moving yet because they're hearing
repeatedly in the media that there's additional cuts coming. So that – when you dialogue with them, they say well,
I'm not going to do anything yet. But I think that business has an opportunity to grow. I think our syndications
business, over time, will have opportunities because there'll be more M&A, particularly in the middle market and
the lower end of the middle market, which plays favorably for us.
We've also – we're also expanding several areas. We're getting into the advisory business. We're building out our
public finance capability. So, there are things that will need to be generation in 2025 that we don't even have
today. So, I think – and they won't be – it won't be gigantic, but it will have an impact. Anyway, those are the
things we're thinking about as we look forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then debt capital markets is at record here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah debt capital markets obviously has been good and that should continue, right, because – and the numbers
Gary mentioned, online utilization, we've looked at the larger clients, and really have very few capital markets
events driving reduction in revolver balance, which is why you said – Gary said, hey, that's going to zap your
demand deposits, right? Our clients are using their cash balances to pay down debt moving into this next quarter.
So, that's what we've seen and there's probably a little bit of reset going on within the customer base and their
balance sheets. They're preparing themselves too, for what's coming. Anyway, that's – so, those areas...
