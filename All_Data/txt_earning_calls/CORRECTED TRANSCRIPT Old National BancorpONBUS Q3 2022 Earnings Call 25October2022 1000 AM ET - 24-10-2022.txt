Thank you, Forum. Good morning. We are pleased to discuss our outstanding third quarter results and update
you on our transformational merger. We completed our systems conversion and branding changes during the
quarter. Internally, we have branded our merger as Better Together and these last two quarters of strong results
demonstrate how we are truly better together to all stakeholders.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team members for their hard work and
dedication to serving our clients, communities and supporting one another throughout this process.
Let's start on slide 4. We reported GAAP earnings for the third quarter of $0.47 per share. The third quarter
included pre-tax charges of $23 million in merger expenses. Excluding these charges from the quarter, adjusted
EPS was $0.51 per common share. This quarter's adjusted EPS was almost 11% higher than the second quarter.
Our adjusted return on average tangible common equity and assets were a strong 23% and 1.35%, respectively.
And our adjusted efficiency ratio was at low 51%, which is the best efficiency ratio I can remember in my 20-year
plus career at Old National.
Our focused execution in our merger, strong deposit franchise, and growing commercial business drove these
robust results and leading returns. We saw higher balances in every portfolio in most markets across our
commercial business. Total loan growth was 14%, and the commercial business grew 17% at an annualized
basis. The higher loan growth, paired with the benefit of a strong deposit franchise, contributed to a 38 basis point
margin expansion.
Our commercial pipeline ended at a strong $5.4 billion. Overall credit quality remains strong and we continue to
be diligent giving the increasing economic uncertainties. However, corporate balance sheets remain solid, and
personal clients retain higher savings rates than we saw in previous cycles. We were pleased to grow deposits on
a quarter-over-quarter while maintaining our deposit pricing discipline with just a 5% deposit beta.
A quick update on hiring. We successfully welcomed 25 new client-facing commercial and wealth management
relationship managers during the quarter. Our talent pipeline remains robust and we will continue to make these
strategic investments. We recently expanded our wealth presence with a new office in Nashville, Tennessee,
hiring seven wealth management professionals. The experienced team will be led by Steve Cook, who also
serves as our Market President, and the office will operate under our new 1834 high-net-worth wealth
management brand. This was a fantastic opportunity and we are already adding new clients to the Bank. Over
time, we will look to expand and offer other banking services to this high growth dynamic market. This further
expansion builds upon last year's strategic investment in a high net worth team in Scottsdale, Arizona.
We were also pleased to announce the hiring of Brent Tischler as our Community Banking CEO. Brent is
responsible for all consumer and retail banking segments. I'm excited about his extensive knowledge and
experience in leading consumer and small business segments, as well as the optimism and enthusiasm he brings
to our organization.
In early December, we will have several enhancements to our overdraft protection programs to provide clients
with more flexibility. The changes will include eliminating the NSF fee and we believe our program will be
consistent with current best practices.
In closing, we will continue to demonstrate the strength of our expanded franchise with commercial loan growth
for the third quarter of nearly 17%, significant improvement to our net interest margin because of our deposit
franchise, and continued strong credit, capital and efficiency metrics. As we look forward, we expect the loan
portfolios to continue to grow, margins to continue to expand driven by our below-peer deposit cost, organic
growth of our wealth management client base, disciplined expense management, and continued savings from our
merger synergies and strong relative credit measures. I believe we are well-positioned to withstand any of the
challenges that lie ahead.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brendon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Jim. Turning to the quarter's results on slide 5, we reported GAAP net income applicable to common
shares of $136 million, or $0.47 per share. Reported earnings were impacted by $23 million in merger-related
charges. Excluding these charges, as well as debt securities losses, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.51,
up 19% year-over-year.
Slide 6 shows the trend in total loan growth on a historical combined basis, excluding PPP loans. Q3 represents
our ninth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth, with total loans increasing 14% on an annualized basis.
Commercial loans grew an annualized 17%, while consumer loans grew an annualized 7%, driven by residential
mortgage. The investment portfolio decreased [ph] 8% (06:25) quarter-over-quarter due to rate-related fair value
adjustments and reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in support of loan growth. We expect investment cash flows
of $850 million over the next 12 months.
Slide 7 provides further details of our commercial loans and pipeline. The strong second quarter growth was well
distributed with 17% annualized growth in C&I and 15% in CRE. Q3 production put some pressure on the
pipeline, but loan demand remained strong and we did see a marked increase in the [ph] excessive (06:57)
category, which was up $400 million over prior quarter.
Turning briefly to pricing. New money yields on C&I increased 109 basis points from Q2 to 5.29%, with new CRE
production yields up 88 basis points to 4.55%.
Slide 8 shows details of our Q3 commercial production. The $2.4 billion of production was well-balanced across
all product lines and major markets, and as always, was consistent with our disciplined approach to credit. In
addition, all of our product segments posted quarter-over-quarter balance sheet growth, which demonstrates the
success we've had in retaining lenders and clients in Chicago, our successful entrances into new expansion
markets, and the quality of our commercial teams throughout our footprint.
Moving to slide 9, end of period deposits were up 1.5% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in municipal
deposits. We are pleased with the stability of our commercial and retail deposit balances, particularly our non-
interest-bearing accounts. Our low loan-to-deposit ratio, coupled with asset liquidity in the form of our investment
and indirect book, provides flexibility heading into this competitive deposit market. That said, we are actively
defending deposit balances through competitive rack rates and pricing exceptions.
We are also playing offense to various deposit specials and select geographies, where we have limited market
share. These actions put upward pressure on rates in Q3, with average total deposit costs up 6 basis points
quarter-over-quarter to a still very low 12 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were up 9 basis points to 18
basis points, resulting in a cycle-to-date beta of just 5%. Our granular, low-cost deposit base should continue to
give us a beta advantage relative to peers throughout this rate cycle. But pricing is expected to increase in Q4. As
a reference point, we ended the quarter with a spot rate on interest-bearing deposits of 33 basis points on
September 30.
Next, on slide 10, you will see details of our net interest income and margins, both improved more than expected
due to Federal loan growth, higher interest rates and better-than-expected deposit pricing life. Net interest margin
expanded 38 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.71%. Core margin, excluding accretion and PPP income,
increased 48 basis points to 3.46%.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Slide 11 provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range. Core margin is
expected to continue to expand meaningfully over the next quarter, albeit at a slower pace. The assumption in our
outlook includes a Fed funds target rate of 4.5% at year-end and a 4% yield on 10-year treasuries. Our outlook
assumes deposit betas increasing from 5% today to a cycle-to-date beta by year-end of 15%. This equates to a
marginal 4Q beta of 30%. We believe the current quarter should allow us to expand margin beyond 2022. Margin
expansion is expected to slow, but we believe we can manage margin deposit betas at or below our asset betas
into 2023.
Also, while remained well-positioned for rising rates, we have been proactively hedging the balance sheet over
the last several quarters to protect our margin from the possibility of a hard economic landing and quick reversal
in Fed policy. We added $600 million in hedge protection this quarter with an average floor strike of 3%.
Slide 12 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $81 million for the quarter. This is generally in
line with our expectations as market conditions continue to put pressure on mortgage and wealth revenues. The
linked-quarter decrease was also impacted by $4 million and discrete Q2 items we discussed last quarter.
Next, slide 13 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusting for merger charges and tax credit
amortization, noninterest expense is $241 million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was historically low at 50.7%.
Expenses were higher than anticipated due to $4 million in provision for unfunded commitments related to Q3
loan growth, a $3 million incentive accrual increase and a $4 million conversion-related reduction in deferred loan
origination costs. This total $7 million impact of incentives and deferred costs are not expected to recur.
Despite the moving parts in Q3, we continue to run ahead of our planned cost synergies and are on track for the
promised merger synergies in the fourth quarter. Q4 expenses are now expected to be $225 million, a $2 million
improvement from our prior-quarter estimate, which equates to approximately 90% of cost synergies achieved by
year-end.
Slide 14 shows our credit trends. Credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios
continue to perform exceptionally well. Net charge-offs were a modest 2 basis points, excluding 8 basis points of
net charge-offs and PCD loans that has an allowance established through acquisition accounting. Our special
assets team is continuing to work through our PCD loans and we would expect charge-offs from this portfolio
remain elevated. The provision expense impact from this effort is expected to be minimal as we carry $61 million
or approximately 5% reserve against this book.
On slide 15, you'll see details of our third quarter allowance, which stands at $302 million, up from $288 million at
the end of Q2. Reserve build was driven primarily by strong loan growth with relatively small increases due to
portfolio mix and a marginally worse economic forecast. The financial health of our clients remained strong and
while credit metrics are stable, we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated qualitative reserves given the
uncertainty in our base case economic outlook. In addition to the $302 million in total reserves, we also carry
$112 million in credit marks.
Slide 16 provides details on our capital position at quarter-end. Our CET1 ratio remains strong at 9.9%. Our TCE
ratio declined 38 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to increases in unrealized losses in our investment book.
Total OCI is now impacted TCE by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic
stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
As I wrap on my comments, here are some key takeaways. We grew adjusted earnings per share of 11%.
Profitability ratios continue to be strong with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.6% and a return
on average assets of 1.35%. We posted another strong quarter of loan growth and better than peer margin
expansion, aided by an industry-leading deposit beta. Expenses also continue to be well managed with a record
low efficiency ratio of 50.7%, with meaningful savings yet to come.
Slide 17 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We ended the quarter with a strong
commercial pipeline, which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth, albeit, at a slower pace in Q3.
Deposits are expected to be stable excluding the impact of the HSA sale.
Net interest income and margins should benefit from continued loan growth and Fed rate increases consistent
with the margin guidance we outlined earlier. We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite
headwinds with wealth management and mortgage following industry patterns. Commercial activity should
support continued strong capital markets revenues, albeit at a lower level in Q3.
We have also finalized plans to implement changes to our NSF OD policies in December that are largely
consistent with industry best practice. We estimate this impact to be minimal in Q4 and approximately $5 million
for the full year of 2023.
Turning to taxes, we expect approximately $4 million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of the year, with
a corresponding full year effective tax rate of approximately 24% on a core FTE basis and 20% on a GAAP basis.
Lastly, our sales of HSA deposit is expected to close in mid-November. Real estate repositioning, as well as other
strategic investments, are expected to partially offset the gain from that sale.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. We do have a full team available, including Mark
Sander, Jim Sandgren, and John Moran.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper
Sandler. Scott, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. How's everybody doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
We're doing great. Great to see you take your rightful place back as number one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
You know, I even jot it down. I've been in the queue since 9:16. I've got to get a life at some point here. I'm glad to
get in the queue. So, I appreciate you taking the question.
Maybe, Brendon, first question, the most appropriate for you. So, obviously just a huge ramp up in the margin and
NII with great deposit betas. Just curious, given some of the steps you've taken to kind of protect things, what do
you think is your ability to grow NII and the margin sequentially once the Fed stops raising rates. And just maybe
kind of qualitatively, how much of this margin is levitating just on a transitory basis and how much can you kind of
harvest and keep for a longer period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We had a lot to unpack there. And a lot of it will depend on deposit betas and deposit pricing post the Fed move.
That said, we have a pretty good view of our margin with a forward curve out to 2023. And we feel really confident
we continue to expand the margin as the Fed continues to move rates.
Post that, we'll continue to have opportunities to reprice our fixed rate book at much higher levels than what it's
running off at. And that'll help offset additional deposit costs. I think the big question is how long do the Fed stay
there, will be a big determining factor in how long we can hold on to the margin at the peak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I'd also add, Scott, we continue to have a mix shift, right, on a lower-yielding assets and the higher-yielding
commercial assets and that will continue to help – let the margin grow, regardless of what the Fed does or doesn't
do.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Perfect. And then, just sort of a cleaner question. Brendon, can you sort of repeat what those
offsets were to the anticipated HFA gain in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We're evaluating a number of things. The biggest ones are thoughts around all of our real estate, both
branch and non-branch real estate, and we're working through that now. So that will have an impact and we'll
likely spend some of that gain in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. So, in other words, kind of a one-time gain and that potentially one-time charges offsetting maybe
some portion of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yes, which should also lead to some additional savings in the next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Yeah. Perfect. All right. Good. Thank you guys very much.

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
We're watching you dialed in first and we saw that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I was curious. I mean, I know that you guys have a pretty large footprint now relative to the past five years. So, I'm
curious, just from a kind of a macro perspective, what do you – what are the kind of the conversations you're
having with clients today, some of their concerns? And kind of juxtaposed against the lending portfolio, does that
open up any opportunities for growth or any areas you might want to potentially pivot away from? I know you guys
don't change your credit standards throughout the cycle, but it's kind of that macro conversation you're having
with clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
The macro conversation with clients is – we think we have opportunities across our geographies and across our
four lines of business and you already saw that this quarter. Real estate was the largest growth driver this quarter,
but all three of our other lines in commercial, middle market, business banking and specialty, all grew about $100
million. And it was widely dispersed geographically. And I think we have the team to compete and win in every
market we're in, Ben. So, we don't favor one versus the other. I think there's just a lot of good opportunities to
grow. Jim, anything you would add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
No. And we're going to continue to look to expand in other markets. Obviously, we talked a little bit about
Nashville and St. Louis and Kansas City continue to perform well and looking at other potential metro markets that
can help support growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. That's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I think franchise, power of the franchise – Ben, I would just add the power of the franchise is getting noticed in
some markets that we hadn't been noticed before, and I think that's really getting people excited about joining our
company. And as we talked about, we were able to hire 25 client-facing folks this quarter and we continue to do
that. There isn't a week goes by that we don't have somebody come through headquarters here looking at an
opportunity to join the team, and I'm really excited about that. It's great to tell our story. The story resonates really
well with folks, and I think it's going to allow us to continue to make those strategic investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. That actually dovetails nicely to my next question. I know you just said the plus 25, and then you
highlighted Nashville specifically from a lender perspective. Is there any cities or MSAs you wanted you could
highlight? I don't know if I tried to build them correctly or not.

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
No. I would just say in our existing footprint, we continue to have opportunities. Adjacent to our footprint, we're
having conversations. So, we're not looking at expanding outside the Midwest at this point in time. We still feel like
we're very comfortable, solid in the Midwest. We do think there's an opportunity to build on Nashville the wealth
management presence. We're in early days there. We really just got started with our office. The great news is
they are making – referring lending opportunities to our team, and so we're servicing those opportunities today,
but we'll be looking to add folks in that team selectively where it makes sense. So, that may be the only place
really outside the Midwest that I would note. But it's mostly inside the Midwest, inside our existing footprint or to
maybe some adjacent markets where we have opportunities to continue to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
And most of the hires reflect our footprint, Ben. We've hired over the last two quarters seven REIT people in
Chicago, seven REIT people in Minneapolis, a few in Indianapolis. I mean – so we've got a handful in a number of
other markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We're early stages of estimating that, but I don't think that's far off what we're hoping to achieve with that with that
repositioning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just sticking with expenses, the $225 million run rate for 4Q expenses, and then you've got
some remaining cost savings in the early part of next year. How should we kind of think about – and maybe you
could frame kind of your expense expectations for next year, or is it still too early, given what you're going to do
with some of the real estate repositioning?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. I think $325 million is a good launching point and based – to move off of into 2023. And you layer in some,
you know, merit increases. As we talked about, we're not going to stop hiring, but we also have some cost
savings to come. But I think $225 million is a good base with merits et you gets in the ballpark of how we're
thinking about next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Perfect. And then maybe just a point of clarity, the 15% deposit beta, was that by the end of the fourth quarter of
this year? And if so, what are your thoughts on, call it, through the cycle deposit betas as we think about the end
of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. That is through the end of the fourth quarter. So it'll be the cycle that may – cycle-to-date beta 15%. Who
knows where this deposit beta ultimately goes. We've been pleased that we've been able to underperform –
outperform our expectations today. I can just tell you that last cycle the combined organization of SMB and OMB
had a significant advantage in the deposit betas. We expect to continue to keep that advantage in this rate cycles
no matter what deposit betas do.

Hey. Good morning. Hey, Brendon. Brendon, maybe I have a question on just the size of the balance sheet. You
talked in your guide for the Q4, a static balance sheet X the deposit sale. In your prepared remarks, you talked
about around $800 million or $900 million of cash flows on the bond book to come off. How should be thinking
about just the size of the investment portfolio? Or maybe another way, what are your expectations for deposit
growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
So, I think we're going to fight to hold deposits stable. I think deposit stable next year is a win, I think, given what
we've seen in the industry. And so, we're going to fight to hold that. We're going to allow investment cash flows to
help provide liquidity. We also have an amount of asset liquidity and a few transaction books including the indirect
book. And we have lots of wholesale funding capacity. We just feel like we have a lot of options for liquidity
heading into this that we don't have to fight for every deposit, but we're going to go out there and take care of our
clients. And we think we have room for – and we're starting from a low loan-to-deposit ratio base as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
And his comments exclude the HSA sale as you remember that, that will come off the top during the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. So, the $800 million – just to go back to that $850 million bond cash flows, the expectation
is the bond portfolio would shrink to fund loan growth to some degree?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe, Jim, just a higher level question. You were talking probably about the 51% efficiency
ratio, which is a great metric. Maybe comment about trajectory from here?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Yeah. I think if you look at Brendon's expense guidance and expanded margins. I think modest improvements are
expected. But it's not going to be and maybe as quickly as we got to 50%, 51%. But I think all the trends are
heading in the right direction to see that number improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just a quick credit question. I think in your prepared remarks, you said expect a little bit higher
charge-offs on the PCE book. Maybe any higher level question or comments about what you might be seeing in a
legacy FMBI book, which I think gets a little bit more attention.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Nothing that is unusual or that we haven't seen before, Chris, I guess, is what I would say. This is Mark. Our
commercial clients are still seeing strong demand and profitability and liquidity overall. There's a little growing
sense of caution out there. So, nothing different than what we're all hearing in terms of economic outlook. So, I
know we feel good about our credit metrics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Thanks, Mark.

Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, Jon. Yeah. Good to hear from you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sorry. I dialed in at the top of the hour, and I know I was going to be last. Just a quick follow-up on Chris' last
question. You talked a little bit about moderating growth. But give us a little bit more in terms of what you're
seeing there in terms of moderation, and severe is the wrong word but how material is it? And then, talk about
kind of your approach to the marketplace as well, if you've been any more cautious?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Yeah. I don't really think we're being any more cautious. I think like everybody else, we're wondering about what
next year brings us. But the pipeline was our second highest pipeline at $5.4 billion. Brendon told you our
accepted category is up meaningfully. I mean, so we continue to expect the portfolios to grow. Just the pipelines
now that have to be closed, $2.4 billion this quarter. But we're really not slowing down at all.
And I think our view is really consistent with what other CEOs are thinking about. I think everybody is looking
forward and cautious about a potential recession, but there really have not been much signs of it from our
borrowers today, particularly in the Midwest. And Mark or Jim?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Said in another way but the same thing, our near-term outlook is favorable because the pipelines are still very
strong and clients are still doing quite well. I mean – but again, some of the CRE markets, they are immune to the
impact of rising rates. But there is plenty of room to run in the form of equity levels and debt service coverage
ratios of our clients. So, look, the pipeline is still really strong there still as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
You follow us a long time, Jon. 17% annualized growth is a strong number by any measure. And so, I think, we're
all just cautious that, how we continue to grow these kinds of levels over the long term. I think the answer is it's
probably going to get revert back closer to some long-term average.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
And as what we said at the end in the second quarter and we're surprised on the upside about this quarter, we'll
probably be – we'll still grow in Q4, but at a little lower pace than this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Yeah, it's an interesting time. No doubt about it. Brendon, slide 7, you talked about average new
production yields. Give us an idea of where things are coming on today on C&I and CRE in terms of yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, they're marginally up from there. So, today, September yields are up a little bit, 10 bps to 15 bps in
commercial real estate. But not much higher. But I expect those continue to go higher given where the five-year
has moved and certainly what we expect the LIBOR to do over the next year – and SOFR to do over the next 60
days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Just two more wealth management, you've talked about a little bit, like Scottsdale and Nashville, and
understand you expect the numbers to be down. But can you talk a little bit more about organic growth, what
you're seeing in terms of progress there? I don't know if it's new households or how you measure it, but take the
market impact away, what are you seeing?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
All right. We've seen organic growth and it's all about focusing on what you can control. And we know we can't
control market values, but we can control what we produce and what retention we have. And we feel really good
about the opportunities not just these teams that we hired, that's incremental, but each of our existing markets.
We see organic growth. We measure it by net new clients and net assets under management.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Any numbers in terms of net new clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
We monitor them. We don't disclose them, I guess is the best way to say it. So, it is growing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I think, internally, we are meeting our own expectations around our growth in that business from the organic
acquisition of new clients.
And Nashville and our high-net worth teams are off just a really strong start. I mean, we're getting some at bats
that we've never had a chance at before, given the sophistication level of the new team we're bringing on. We
brought on last year and the new team in Nashville, I mean, they're bringing in just great new opportunities for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then, just last one smaller item. You talked about playing offense in deposit gathering where you
have limited market share. Can you give us some example of that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So, we'll go out in an area in Michigan, maybe pick a Grand Rapids where we have relatively low market
share and we'll put a pretty heavy write-down and a money market, a new money market account at a fairly high
rate. Generally, a teaser rate. We'll run some [ph] price ECD (32:28) specials in those markets and try to be
annoying to some of our bank competitors in that space. And that's worked really well for us last rate cycle, and
it's allowing us to grow some deposits in this cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Got it. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Operator: Thank you for your question. We now have a follow-up question from Chris McGratty with KBW.
Chris, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Brendon, just a clarification on the non-interest income guidance. It sounds like the run rate on the service
charges will make its way to 18%, 18.5% once the implementations go in, and I heard you on the trust. What
about the other income line? It's kind of been all over the over the board and just trying to get a sense of if we
take all these pieces together, what's like a reasonable range for just total fees entering next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think the other income item is $11 million on the slide. I think that's a good base to go from. The noise
really was in 2Q and we had that $4 million of kind of an odd set of factors that hit Q2. But I think the $11 million is
a good run rate base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So that would put kind of the total run rate around $80 million something like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think that's fair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
