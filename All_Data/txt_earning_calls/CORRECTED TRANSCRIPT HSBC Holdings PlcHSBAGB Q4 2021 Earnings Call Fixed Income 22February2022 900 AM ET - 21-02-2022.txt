MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to today's HSBC's
2021 Annual Results Fixed Income Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be some
opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I must advise that this
conference is being recorded today.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Carlo Pellerani, Group Treasurer.

Carlo Pellerani
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you very much, Martin, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Carlo. I'm joined today by two individuals
that need no introduction, Richard O'Connor, Global Head of Investor Relations, and Greg Hayes, Head of Debt
Investor Relations.
I'm not going to go through the slides that we posted nor going to give a very long speech. I'll limit myself to
making a few highlights about the results. And then I'll go through into a bit more detail on the financial resources
and then pretty quickly go into Q&A.
In terms of the highlights for the results, 8.3% return on tangible, quite helped by the release of ECL provisions.
But we have very good earnings diversification with all the regions being profitable. Revenues grew by 2% in the
quarter and we have, given the rate environment, more confidence on a positive NII trend. And you would have
seen that we have announced that we are now flagging a 10% return on tangible for 2023 onwards, one year
earlier than previously planned. In terms of balance sheet dynamics, we had $38 billion of loan growth across

wealth and personal banking and commercial banking and as well we had $24 billion of growth in deposits for the
quarter.
Our credit quality remains good. We had low stage 3 charges and you would have seen that our stage 3 loans
represent about 1.8% of the total loans, and they have been stable at that level. We have now released about
85% of the COVID reserves that we had put during 2020, and we have $600 million of those still remaining. We
are expecting our ECL charges to normalize somewhere around 30 basis point during 2022. You would have
seen that we took some charges on China CRE and we have given you some slides in the document and some
more information where you can see our exposures and details around those.
Turning to financial resources, taking each of them in turn, first from a capital perspective our capital ratios
continue to be quite strong. 15.8% CET1 ratio at the end of the year, dividends of $0.25 and we have announced
a new $1 billion buyback on top of the up to $2 billion that we had announced in the last quarter.
As a reminder, we have flagged that we are planning to be back within our target range of 14% to 14.5% CET1
ratio from this year onwards. From a liquidity perspective, liquidity continued to be super strong, LCR of 138%.
But that, of course, masks the surplus liquidity we have in all the subsidiaries which gets deducted from the HQLA
ratio. So if you were to take into account that, the total HQLA that we have as a group is $880 billion. We continue
to pursue initiatives to increase the returns and efficiency on the excess liquidity in addition to our desire to
increase our customer lending book.
MREL ratio, very, very healthy at the end of the year. Please note that our requirements have actually gone down
by 170 basis points on the back of the UK leverage computations which affect both the leverage base
requirement but also the sum of the parts given that a lot of the entities are leverage constrained from an MREL
perspective.
From a funding perspective we have been until now in a building out phase of our MREL stack. We have ended
that phase and now we're getting into a refinancing and rebalancing mode of the stack, so we should be
expecting pretty much zero net senior holdco issuance for the year.
We are flagging about $10 billion from a gross perspective. We are likely to be in the market for AT1 this year. We
don't quite have much of a need. Of course, we reserve the right to be in the market should we think that's
appropriate. We are conversely planning to return to the Tier 2 market. We have been absent from that market for
about five years. And you would have seen that we are saying that we are planning to have around $4 billion of
issuance for the year, and we have added some disclosures in terms of our legacy capital stack and some
updates on our position on IBOR.
That's all I wanted to say. So, in summary, a very strong year, return of targets have been brought forward by
about a year, improved rate environment which gives you a nice tailwind, capital funding and liquidity positions
are all very, very strong, net issuance substantially down on prior years and our MREL stack now at a steady
state.
So, with that very brief introduction, I'll open up for question. Martin, back to you, please.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 22-Feb-2022
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Lee Street from
Citigroup. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Strategist, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Hello. Thanks for taking – thanks for doing the call and thanks for taking my questions. I have three for you.
Firstly, just on the slide 21, the fixed income slides, and we've had a fair few questions always about how the
infection risk works that you highlight there. Now, [ph] clearly it doesn't highlight there's (00:06:26) anything new,
but could you just clarify exactly how it works? Secondly, as you highlighted, you're returning to the Tier 2 market,
I think you flagged about $4 billion of issuance. Obviously, you've got a significant volume of operating company
Tier 2 still outstanding. A lot of that's not going to work any longer.
I guess the question is why wouldn't you look to do some form of liability management? And then finally, on
additional Tier 1, and you highlight limited needs, just any thoughts around that, because obviously it looks like
you've got quite a few components coming up to call over the forthcoming year and why you need to be quite so
limited. That would be my three questions. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks very much for the questions, Lee. So, on the first one on infection risk, infection risk can be mitigated
when we voluntarily de-recognize the securities. So you would have seen that that is kind of the plan that we have
for each of the components of the stack. So we don't think that that poses any issue at the moment that each of
the securities lose kind of eligibility. In terms of Tier 2, yes, you're right, we have a number of Tier 2 outstanding
that have lost as well some value on some of those that will lose value in the future.
Liability management is always one of the potential options that we'll have. We will look at each of those. In turn,
we will continue to look at all options available. In terms of AT1, yes, I mean, you should for now assume and
that's what we have in the plan that we would let those transactions to come and we wouldn't be replacing them.
So we have no plan at the moment to replacing those AT1s for this year. Again, depending on market conditions
we may want to get ahead of [ph] next year or few years (00:08:10).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Strategist, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
So just to clarify, so you have no plans to replace them or you will only look to replace them. So I'm not sure I
understood.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So we have no plan for issuing any AT1 this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Strategist, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Okay. And can I read anything into [ph] retention (00:08:26) with regards of the calls that are coming up?

Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
No, you shouldn't.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Street Q
Strategist, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you for your time.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question today comes from the line of Daniel David of Autonomous. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel David Q
Analyst, Bernstein Autonomous LLP
Hi, thanks for the call and taking my questions. I also want to focus on the legacy risk. I think there's quite a lot of
interest there. Just focusing on the legacy Tier 1 and noting your comments and I can see that they're not MREL
capital. Can you just help me with the rationale for leaving these bonds outstanding, given the CET1 headroom
you've got and what they're costing you? And are these bonds swapped? So could the interest rate be hedged
when you come to potentially do a May call?
The second question I have just goes back to your point on derecognition from an FX risk point of view. I had
understood the EBA guidance is quite clear that you can't do this unless you call, change terms or LME to
mitigate the infection risk. So my question is, is the UK's approach different to the EBA's as the PRA, I guess,
rolled over and let you take this treatment? I'm just a bit surprised to read this.
And then finally, just on the resolvability assessment framework, could you just help us understand the timelines?
Have you submitted all your information and when do you expect the results? And do you expect to be told on the
PRA stance before the public disclosure in June? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks. Thanks, Daniel. On the legacy securities, so when we're assessing the legacy securities that are
outstanding, we always look at, if you want, three different components and the blended result of those three
components drives whether we will be taking any action on those securities. Those components are, first of all,
the regulatory requirement. We are in ongoing discussions with the regulators around those. Maybe we'll get more
information around mid-year about those.
But it's fair to say that the regulatory treatment of the legacy securities is not black and white. I mean, there are
shades of gray there in all sorts of securities. I would note that some securities are particularly challenging and
that includes [ph] near loss (00:10:43) securities where, as you know, even if we wanted, it would be impossible to
pretty much eliminate a full stack. So the point I'm trying to make is this is not a black and white. Obviously, from a
regulatory perspective, it would be better for those securities not to be there. But given the complications and all
the different components, I think the regulatory treatment tends to be a little bit grayer than that.
The second component is, of course, yours and investors' interest. We are a long-term issuer in the market and
we want to have a long-term constructive relationship with investors and, as such, we will take those interests in
mind. But, finally and very, very importantly, we look at the economics of those securities and the economics of
5

those securities as an outsider, outside in from the firm, is not totally straightforward for you to see how those
economics play out because you need to look at the accounting treatment that we have for those securities
internally.
We need to look indeed as to whether we have those securities hedged or unhedged from an interest rate
perspective, we need to look at what is the optionality value of those securities for future funding, like, for
example, we have at the moment in the case of Discos. So there is all sorts of economic components that affect
whether those securities are or not in our interest to be called.
Clearly, I'll leave it at that, but that basically drives whether we would or not call some of the securities. In terms of
hedging, we're not going to comment on individual hedging, on individual securities, but likewise we shouldn't
assume that we have hedged them all.
In terms of the recognition, I think you pretty much you answered it in your question, it is the UK rather than the
EBA approach. From a UK perspective, we can deal with that by voluntarily derecognizing the securities that is
acceptable way of dealing with infection risk in the UK. And in terms of the rough timeline, we submitted our self-
assessment last year.
We have been in contact with the Bank of England and [indiscernible] (00:12:59). They have sent a number of
questions. On the back of those, we actually sent an update to that a couple of weeks ago in line with everyone
else in the market. And the next step of the process is mid-year, just in June, there is going to be a public
disclosure made by both the Bank of England and ourselves on the status of that assessment. I guess we'll have
to wait for that one. Obviously, we will have discussions with them ahead of that in terms of what is it that we're
going to be disclosing and we'll be aligning communication.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel David Q
Analyst, Bernstein Autonomous LLP
Thanks, [indiscernible] (00:13:39). Just to double check also on the voluntary derecognition point, on the slide you
say subject to regulatory approval. So has this been approved or is it waiting to be approved?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
That is part of the discussion on the self-assessment and on the rough, and you'll see, I guess, the effect of that at
middle of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel David Q
Analyst, Bernstein Autonomous LLP
Okay. All right. Thanks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for doing the call. Just following up on one point then another subject. You mentioned the Discos, if
you were to leave those outstanding, how would they be categorized within the liability stack? And then two other
questions, one, you made a large provision for real estate in China. Could you talk about the Hong Kong real

estate market and if there's going to be any need for provisions there given the economic slowdown and the
moves we've seen of personnel out of Hong Kong? And then, third, on UK mortgages, swap rates moving much
faster than you could probably reprice mortgages. So, could you talk about the impact on your margin for the next
couple of quarters on that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Robert. So in terms of the [ph] DISCO state (00:15:08) de facto becomes senior debt. And
that senior debt is actually not that expensive. So the discos are LIBOR plus 10 to LIBOR plus 25 perpetual
funding. So we look at them in the context of funding value. Most of the discos are issue out of a non-ring-fenced
bank, which is an entity that is naturally in funding need long term. So having that optionality is actually quite
valuable. So that's how we look at the discos. And...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
...in terms. Sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
No, go ahead – sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
In terms of China CRE, yes, I think the segment of the China CRE that is most impacted is the offshore segment.
We have exposures to that segment in Hong Kong. We have about $11.6 billion of exposure there. About half of
that book is in what we call enhanced monitoring mode. The other half is investment grade and better.
And so there is always of course a chance that you will get more impact at this stage. We have reserved what we
think is appropriate for where we are. Just note that we have announced or we have mentioned that we're
expecting that we will be returning to around a normalized 30 basis points of provisions for the year. That 30 basis
point include as well any foreseeable impact that we can at this stage see on the CRE market. Having said that,
of course the situation is fluid and we will continue to look at it. I mean, if you were to look at developments this
year, there seems to be a little bit more support for the China CRE market coming in terms of commentary and
some of the dynamics in the market. But again, trying to predict that ahead is treacherous. So I think we will have
to see how that develops.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just to add one thing, clearly the public companies you've read about having liquidity and other issues are
Mainland China public companies [ph] much of which was because of exposure to (00:17:33) offshore. The
question was very much more, I think about Hong Kong incorporated public companies who have been – who we
have very strong relationship with for decades tend to be very well resourced, very, very conservative LTVs. The

Hong Kong property market has been very, very resilient and indeed still very, very good prices clearing in both
the commercial and residential property market in Hong Kong. So clearly we keep an eye on all our portfolios, but
the issue is really that Mainland China offshore market at the moment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
And in terms of UK mortgage pricing, yes, your observation is right, the swap – I mean, a lot of the mortgages in
the UK, of course, are fixed and the dynamics of the swap markets are slightly different to the dynamics on the
short end. So, yes, it is quite possible that that market will continue to have a little bit of competitive pressure. It is
a very, very competitively priced market. We continue to originate new mortgages on returns that are higher than
our cost of capital. So at the moment we are comfortable with those mortgages even at the compressed spreads,
but of course, is something that we will keep an eye on. I don't know, Richard, if you want to slide in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. The other thing is clearly the market tends to look at mortgage prices in the newspapers today versus swap
rates today, but clearly there's a lag between swap rates either moving up or down and [ph] companies are
themselves (00:19:08) moving mortgage pricing. We don't move it every day. Clearly, we move it on a regular
basis, but there's always a lag between mortgage pricing going up and down versus swap rates. So clearly just as
a reminder swap rates have moved and inflation moved dramatically in the last six weeks, but just bear in mind
there's normally a lag there before mortgage pricing starts to reflect that.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question today comes from the line of Alvaro Ruiz of
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Ruiz de Alda Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Thank you very much for taking my questions and apologies, because I have three questions, a lot of them about
legacy. And the first one is about HSBC 5.844% and if I follow with what you just said that there are three angles
to LME or to exercise the make-whole call of the security, you are looking at regulatory requirements, investor
interest and accounting treatment. I think it's quite clear that the security is useless from a capital perspective
issued from [ph] an SPB (00:20:29) and with all the details that you already said in the pillar 3. Then if you can
provide some color on the security, that will be great.
The second one is about Tier 2 more broadly. You said that you are going to issue Tier 2 for first time this year
[ph] and another two LMEs, the opco (00:20:46) Tier 2 securities, do you need to issue it first? In other words, an
approval to LME, the securities is subject to replace all other Tier 2 securities, assuming from obviously from the
holding company. And my third question is about the Discos. I think we discussed this point in the past, but one of
the Discos is issued from the Hong Kong subsidiary. Can you please confirm that you look at this security in a
different way to the other three? Thank you.

Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Alvaro, despite the questions are all on legacy. Your first question, I think, is on the non-ring-fenced
bank trust preferred security. Yes, you have identified correctly, I think, one of the three conditions, the regulatory
treatment. I mean, we haven't called the securities. So it must mean that the other conditions kind of affect why
we haven't made a decision a little.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Ruiz de Alda Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
I'm sorry, which condition, investor interest, I mean, or accounting treatment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, it must be also the economics.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Ruiz de Alda Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
It's not economical to exercise the make-whole call of these securities is what you're saying?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
That could be one of the conclusions. Overall, we haven't made a decision to call them because on balance that
doesn't work for us at this stage, we will continue to look at it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Ruiz de Alda Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, in terms of the Tier 2s, no, I think we don't have a specific requirement on the Tier 2 stack, right? We have a
capacity to have Tier 2 in our stack up to a certain amount that at the moment we have underweight, right? So, it's
not a precondition for – one is not a precondition to the other. So we will continue to look at all the options for Q2,
I mean, that could include SMEs, it could include exchanges. It would be issuances.
We will look at all of the above. In terms of discos, yes, I think the only similarity between the Hong Kong
securities and the ones who are non-ring-fenced is the type of instruments. The two are very different because
the legal entities have very different needs. You could say that our Hong Kong entity is less of a natural funding
need entity than it is the [ph] non-retail (00:23:37) bank. And also from a regulatory perspective, the Hong Kong
Discos are no longer counting from a regulatory perspective. So we don't treat them the same. We would make
those decisions individually in each of the entities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Ruiz de Alda Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Hello. Sorry and thanks very much. Don't keep you very much longer. And guess what, it's on legacies, which you
should be very proud of because it means no one's concerned about anything fundamental or anything else. So
it's actually quite a good thing that we focus on these sort of the trends [indiscernible] (00:24:49) of these
securities. But I've got one question, which I don't know if I missed earlier, I only heard Lee on the first one which
is normally the first question, so I don't think I missed anything, but LIBOR. I know you put a slide in there after
the, I think, slide 22 on the slide deck.
How are you thinking in terms of your fallback language on the Discos because it's really not clear, it talks about
sort of lowest deposit rate, sort of as a base of the fallback of LIBOR? SOFR is not based on deposits. So I was
just wondering what you're thinking in terms of whether you fix, whether you've got an alternative? Is there an
alternative that I didn't know about? I'm sure there is. I mean, just talk to me a little bit about your fallback
language on the discos, if you may. Thank you.

Hi, Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, so, Sterling [ph] near low (00:25:33) instruments, for those the US
legislative solution doesn't quite work. Of course, the conundrum with those securities, like for all the [ph] near
loss (00:25:47) securities is that we will not be able to successfully consent for 100% of the securities given the
dynamics of the new law. So we are looking at the options with those securities. I mean, just...

Yes, in terms of those securities, we are looking to offer similar consent solicitation as we did with the other
securities. We'll come with those in due course. I mean, those securities, we have time until 2023 for them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Sure. But do you think based on the language in the documentation that you can use software and then maybe
upscale the coupons as compensation as you did with the sterling liable bonds or would you use a different base
rate? I mean, clearly it can't square the circle in terms of what the language in the bond says about the lowest
deposit rate and what you're talking about in terms of offering a new – what the lowest deposit rate sort of
replacement would be if it's not a SOFR? Because it is not [ph] corporate rate (00:27:17)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Some...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
...it's the treasury rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, the fallbacks on those securities are questionable at this stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So it's not...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Would you consider fixing or would you consider just actually getting rid of the damned things and stopping these
irritating questions from people like me?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
It is tempting. It is definitely tempting. We will listen, and we will leave our options open at this stage. I mean,
overall, we are committed in seeking to remediate or mitigate anything around [ph] IBOR rates (00:27:55) and we
are going to work together with investors to find a solution that works for everyone and this is a complex space
highlighted by the goal.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 22-Feb-2022
You should go into politics, honestly. Right? Okay. So basically there's no firm answer. There's no guidance. It's
just like, let's hope for the best and not for the worst. Is that the kind of thing [indiscernible] (00:28:21)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. Yes. I think it's more than that, right. In terms of the English law securities included in the discos we expect
to offer a similar constant solicitation as the one we did for US LIBOR securities. I think that's the best I can say at
this stage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Right. Okay. All right. Well, as and when you know what the possible base might be and do please let the market
know, we'd be I'm sure very appreciative.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlo Pellerani A
Group Treasurer & Group General Manager, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Jenkins Q
Analyst, Jefferies
Thanks very much.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
