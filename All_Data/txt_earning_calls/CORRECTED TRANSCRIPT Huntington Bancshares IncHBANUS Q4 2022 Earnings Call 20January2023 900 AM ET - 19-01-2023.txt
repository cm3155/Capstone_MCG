Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are very pleased to
announce our fourth quarter results, which included GAAP net income of $645 million and adjusted net income of
$657 million. For the full-year, reported GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and adjusted net income was $2.3
billion. Both results reflect record earnings for Huntington.
2022 marked a year of numerous successes, driven by our team's execution of organic growth initiatives,
realization of both expense and revenue synergies from the TCF acquisition, and unwavering focus on credit
discipline and proactive balance sheet management. We ended the year with substantial momentum.
Clearly, the economic environment is becoming increasingly challenging. However, Huntington is better
positioned today than at any time since I joined over a dozen years ago. And over those years, we've transformed
the risk profile of the bank and remained highly disciplined. We are taking proactive steps now to again position
Huntington to outperform, and we enter the year with solid capital levels, top-tier reserves, a growing core deposit
base and strong credit metrics. We continue to see opportunities to grow revenue and profit.
Now, on to slide 4. First, we finished the year with our fourth consecutive quarter of record pre-provision net
revenue. This was supported by higher interest income, driven by earning asset growth, and an expanded net
interest margin. Revenue growth has been exceptional over the course of the year and we intend to protect and
grow that revenue base.
Second, we delivered broad based loan growth, ex PPP, of 10% year-over-year. As we drove this growth, we also
optimized for return while still exceeding our loan growth outlook. One example of this optimization is indirect
auto, where our production in the quarter was approximately 15% lower than the prior quarter, while our new loan
yields increased by over 100 basis points.
Importantly, we continued to grow our deposit base with multiple consecutive quarters of growth. We believe this
is a differentiator for Huntington in this environment. It also demonstrates the breadth of our franchise and our
colleagues' ability to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships.
Third, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the top-tier return profile and were at or above
our medium term targets. These results demonstrate the earnings power of the company and we expect to
continue to deliver on these targets. As we intended, we delivered common equity Tier 1 capital to the middle of
our 9% to 10% operating range. We are also very pleased to announce a new two-year share repurchase
program.
Fourth, we ended 2022 with strong momentum across the business that we carry into this new year. We remain
focused on growth, aligned with our risk appetite. Importantly, we have the capital, credit reserves and strength of
balance sheet that give us confidence to continue to deliver on our organic growth priorities.
Slide 5 highlights the tremendous earnings power of the franchise, which has improved sequentially over the
course of the year. PPNR is over 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Our return on tangible common equity is
top tier. We managed our asset sensitivity throughout the year and deliberately positioned the company to benefit
from higher interest rates, which resulted in significant revenue growth. We've also been prudent in taking actions
to protect this revenue base should we experience lower rates over the next few years. We will continue to be
dynamic in this regard with our goal of reducing volatility and creating a tight corridor around the path of spread
revenue.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
At our Investor Day in November, we shared with you our highly defined set of strategic priorities. We expect
these strategies will drive sustained revenue growth and support gains in efficiency over the long-term. As you
also heard, this management team is a group of experienced operators. To further accelerate the execution of
these strategies and support increased efficiency, we will be taking a series of actions during 2023 to align our
organizational structure with a focus on our critical priorities.
We expect these actions will result in new growth and efficiency opportunities. We will share more details on
these actions as they're finalized over the course of the first quarter. However, one element will be a voluntary
retirement program for our middle and senior management. Overall, I believe this program will be important to
support our colleagues and create value for our shareholders.
In closing, we are well positioned for continued growth. We have the strategies, the momentum in our businesses
to support growth. We also benefit from highly engaged colleagues who've consistently delivered outstanding
customer service and are a true differentiator. We've the credit discipline to outperform and remain focused on
rigorous expense management, investment prioritization and capital allocation. We remain committed to our long
track record of managing to positive annual operating leverage and are intently focused on driving shareholder
value.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported
GAAP earnings per common share of $0.42 and adjusted EPS was $0.43. Return on tangible common equity or
ROTCE came in at 26% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 26.5%. Further adjusting for
AOCI, ROTCE was 19.8%.
Loan balances continued to expand as total loans increased by $1.9 billion, and excluding PPP increased by $2.1
billion. Deposit balances increased by $1.6 billion on an end of period basis, while average deposits were
essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Pre-provision net revenue expanded sequentially by 4.2% from last
quarter to $893 million, and on a full year basis, year-over-year increased by 36% to $3.2 billion. Credit quality
remains strong, with net charge-offs of 17 basis points and nonperforming assets declining to 50 basis points.
Turning to slide 7, average loan balances increased 1.7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by both commercial and
consumer loans. Commercial loans continue to represent the majority of loan growth. Within commercial,
excluding PPP, average loans increased by $1.9 billion or 2.7% from the prior quarter. Primary components of
this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $900 million, tied to continued normalization
of dealer inventory levels, as well as seasonality with shipments of winter equipment arriving to dealers.
We also saw the continued long-term trend of demand within our asset finance businesses, which drove balances
$300 million higher in the quarter. Commercial real estate balances increased by $500 million, largely as a result
of production late in the third quarter and lower prepays. End of period balances were higher by $180 million. Auto
floorplan utilization continued to normalize, which drove balances higher by $300 million. Additional increases in
line utilization over time represents a substantial ongoing opportunity.
We also saw higher balances in specialty verticals, such as mid-corporate and tech and telecom, which were
offset by lower balances in other areas as a result of our return optimization initiatives. In consumer, growth was

led by residential mortgage, which increased by $500 million as on sheet production outpaced runoff and was
supported by slower prepaid speeds. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto balances, which declined by
$230 million and RV/marine, which declined by $50 million.
Turning to slide 8, we delivered $1.6 billion of deposit growth for the quarter and $4.6 billion for the year on an
ending basis. On an average basis, deposits were lower by 0.2%, while increasing 2.4% year-over-year.
Competition for deposits has intensified beginning in earnest in September and continuing into the fourth quarter.
Notwithstanding that, we are pleased with the traction we saw over the course of the quarter as our teams
delivered robust production, demonstrating the deposit gathering capabilities across the bank.
Ending deposit growth was led by consumer, which increased by $1.6 billion. We saw a mix shift in line with our
expectations, including incremental growth in both money market and time deposits. We continue to remain
disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at 64 basis points for the fourth quarter. We
will remain dynamic, balancing core deposit growth, the competitive rate environment and the utilization of a
broad range of funding options.
On slide 9, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net
interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $67 million or 5% to $1.459
billion. Net interest margin expanded 10 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and expanded 11
basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion.
Slide 10 highlights our high quality deposit base and diversified funding profile. For the current cycle to-date, our
beta on total cost of deposits was 17%. As we have noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher
from here over the course of the rate cycle. Overall, our beta continues to track to our expectations.
Turning to slide 11, throughout 2022, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset
sensitivity. We also incrementally added to our hedging program to manage possible downside rate risks over the
longer term. During the quarter, we executed a net $3.2 billion of receive-fixed swaps and $800 million of forward
starting swaption collars.
At this point, based on the current rate outlook and yield curve opportunities, we believe we have optimized the
size of the program. We are comfortable with our position today as we balance near-term costs versus longer
term protection. As always, we will be dynamic as we monitor the outlook and the yield curve. We maintain
unused hedge capacity that we could deploy should the curve revert and/or steepen to a level where we would
add incremental downside rate protection hedges.
On the securities portfolio, we saw another step-up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We are benefiting from
reinvestment as well as the hedge strategy to protect capital. We will continue to reinvest cash flows of
approximately $1 billion each quarter at attractive new purchase yields around 5%.
Moving to slide 12, noninterest income was $499 million, up $1 million from last quarter. We drove record activity
within our capital markets businesses during the quarter and throughout 2022. Capstone continued to perform
well and our underlying capital markets businesses outside of Capstone finished the year strong, up 26% year-
over-year. We remained pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business
with another positive quarter of net asset flows.
On a year-over-year basis, we saw lower mortgage banking income as a result of the higher rate environment and
from lower deposit service charges from Fair Play enhancements we implemented during 2022. Offsetting these
5

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
factors were higher capital markets revenues and payments revenues. Importantly, we're executing on our
strategy to drive higher value revenue streams and our fee mix continues to trend favorably.
Moving on to slide 13, GAAP noninterest expense increased $24 million compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted
for notable items, core expenses increased by $19 million. This quarterly increase in core expenses was primarily
the result of revenue-driven compensation tied to capital markets production. Additionally, we saw seasonally
higher medical claims in the quarter, which increased by $16 million. Underlying these results, core expenses
were well-controlled, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined expense management.
Slide 14 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.44%. Our tangible common equity ratio
or TCE increased to 5.55%. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.3%. We ended the year having delivered on
our plan to drive common equity Tier 1 to the middle of our 9% to 10% operating range. Going forward, our capital
priorities have not changed: fund organic growth, support our dividend and provide capacity for all other uses,
including share repurchases.
After having held back on share repurchases for the last several quarters, our expectation is that over the course
of 2023 and beyond, we will now return to a more normalized capital distribution mix, including share
repurchases. Our board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2024. Given the
current economic outlook, our thinking is that we will not actively repurchase shares during the first half of 2023 as
we watch the path of the economy. This may result in capital ratios continuing to expand in the near term. We like
the flexibility the program provides and we believe it is prudent to maintain an authorized share repurchase
program as part of our overall capital management framework.
On slide 15, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 17 basis points for
the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 5 basis points from the prior year as credit
performance continues to normalize. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced
for six consecutive quarters. Criticized loans have similarly improved for four consecutive quarters. Allowance for
credit losses was up slightly, driving the coverage ratio higher to 1.9% of total loans.
Turning to slide 16, you will note a strong reserve position. As I mentioned, the portfolio has continued to perform
extraordinarily well and we believe our disciplined approach to credit through the cycle underpins the overall
strength of our balance sheet. We were pleased to update our medium-term financial targets at Investor Day in
November, and these form the foundation of our expectations over our strategic planning horizon. We believe
these metrics are at the core of value creation, profit growth, return on capital, and the commitment to drive
positive annual operating leverage.
Turning to slide 18, let me share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook. As we discussed at Investor Day, we
analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action
plans. Our targets are anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook and
the forward yield curve as of December 31. The baseline assumes a mild recession in 2023 with modest net GDP
growth for the full year. The economy is expected to exit the year on a path toward recovery, with inflation
gradually subsiding.
Since Investor Day, the economic outlook is incrementally worse and is likely at the lower end of the baseline
scenario outcomes. Our baseline outlook for 2023 is for average loans to grow between 5% and 7%, led by
commercial, with more modest growth in consumer. We will continue to focus on optimizing for returns and driving
loan expansion in select areas. Deposits are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, reflecting continued
growth and deepening of customer and primary bank relationships.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Net interest income is expected to increase between 8% and 11%, driven by continued earning asset growth and
expanded full year net interest margin. Noninterest income is projected to be approximately flat. We expect
continued robust performance from our areas of strategic focus, capital markets, payments and wealth
management.
During 2023, several other factors are offsetting that growth, including our anticipated holding of the majority of
our SBA loan production on sheet, thereby reducing near-term fee revenue in favor of longer term high returns
spread revenue, lower income of approximately $23 million associated with purchase accounting accretion in
fees. Please refer to slide 30 for more details. Lower operating lease revenue as we continue to transition to more
capital leases. Importantly, we expect this will result in lower operating lease depreciation expense as well; lower
mortgage banking income for the full year 2023 versus 2022.
And finally, in light of the economic outlook, we are implementing risk mitigating deposit policy changes that will
result in a lower incidence of overdrafts and related service charges. In addition, we are reducing NSF fees to
zero in the first quarter. This will result in an approximate $5 million reduction in fee income per quarter, which we
expect to be more than offset by lower associated charge-offs.
As you know, the first quarter is generally a seasonal low for overall fee income. We expect fee income will grow
sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. On expenses, as Steve noted, we intend to hold growth to a
low level given the environment, even as we remain committed to funding critical long-term investments. We plan
to manage core underlying expense growth between 2% and 4% for the full year. This level of expense growth
benefits from the ongoing efficiency initiatives we've discussed previously, such as Operation Accelerate, branch
optimization and the organizational alignment actions that Steve highlighted.
Added to the core expense growth, we expect approximately $60 million higher expenses from the full year run
rate of Capstone and Torana, and $33 million of increased FDIC insurance expense associated with the
surcharge. In addition, we expect the first half of the year to include some amount of restructuring charges
associated with the expense management actions we are taking. We will provide more details about these actions
later in the quarter.
Overall, our low expense growth, coupled with expanded revenues is expected to support another year of positive
operating leverage. We expect net charge-offs will be on the low end of our long term through the cycle range of
25 basis points to 45 basis points. Our 2023 guidance reflects the current macroeconomic outlook. We will
continue to be diligent in analyzing the macro environment and we'll react as needed to manage as the year plays
out. We ended 2022 in a position of strength and have good momentum. We have every expectation of continuing
to outperform this year.
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers. Tim, over to you.

Hi, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Question on deposit growth, you mentioned deposit competition has intensified quite a bit. And we can see
from the CD rates that you're offering in the market, that you've been proactively raising those CD rates and
offering more 14-month CDs. So just given all of that, can you talk about how much of the projected deposit
growth in 2023 will be driven by CDs and what the overall deposit mix is likely to look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. This is Zach. I'll take that question. Thank you for asking it. Generally speaking, we're seeing our
deposit growth continuing to trend pretty well in line with the outlook that we've given, between 1% and 4% growth
for the full year. So we think we're on that run rate. I think it will be balanced between both consumer and
commercial.
And to your point, we'll continue to – the mix of that deposit gathering will continue to trend as we expected and it
is baked into our overall rate and beta expectations for higher rate products, like time deposits, like money
markets, et cetera. I think we're operating in this rate cycle clearly at a lower level of mix of those products than
we were, for example, in the last rate cycle. So we'll clearly see that trend higher throughout the course of the
next several quarters, but in line with our general expectations. It all comes back to our focus of deepening
relationships with our existing customers and our primary bank relationships. And so we think it's working pretty
well and expected to continue as we go out to 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then maybe on the NIM trajectory from here, can you comment on if we're close to peak? And given
what you said on the hedges and the fact that you're through the program at least for now, how should we think
about a floor for NIM from here over the course of the next four to eight quarters, if the Fed does start cutting
rates? Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Yeah. On the topic of NIM, I think let's take a step back. We've significantly benefited over the last three quarters
from our explicit actions to manage NIM and to manage asset sensitivity, seen more than 60 basis points NIM
expansions in the last three quarters alone, and it was very intentional with a mind toward continuing our top tier
performance in NIM over the course of long periods of time that we've done.
As we stand now, as we start to look into 2023, we do believe there's more room to go on asset betas, and we'll
see yields continuing to increase out over the next few quarters. However, we're further along in that process,
probably three-quarters of the way through than we are on the deposit beta side where we also expected, as we
said, rates continuing to track higher over the course of the next several quarters. We're probably only about
halfway through the deposit beta cycle. And when you couple that dynamic with what is currently the expectation
on yield curve that we'll see short-end rates fall towards the latter part of 2024, it is reasonable to project a
somewhat downward trajectory of NIM over the course of 2023.
Our goal will be to manage NIM, as we've said on a number of occasions previously, within as tight a corridor in
2023 as we can, really protecting the downside with our hedging program and ultimately driving toward sequential
and sustained growth in net interest income on a dollar basis. And I think when we couple what we expect to be a
pretty strong NIM level overall with the loan growth that we expect to continue to drive, again, to the guidance 5%
to 7% over the course of this year, we'll see that NII on a dollar basis continuing to expand, and so that's the
focus.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
I want to start, sort of follow up Zach, with the NIM expected to trend down, given all the hedges and protection
you've put in place to sort of tighten that band, can you frame for us how much downside could we see? What's
the range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks, Steven, for the question. Look, I think the trend is something on the order of single digits
reduction on a kind of a quarterly basis as we go throughout 2023. There's a range of uncertainties. So I want to
be clear, and not being overly precise, you just think about all the factors that are going to play into that. The Fed
funds actions, which, as you know from starting at the dot plots, are not aligned with the market expectation. And
so how that all plays out, I think, is going to be the most important factor, the pace of the trajectory of beta, which
at this point seems to be fairly well linear across time, but we'll have to wait and see how that goes. And clearly,
the big one is the economy and where that tracks over the near term. So it's difficult to be overly precise, so I'm
trying not to, and bring back to the dollar growth. Our goal will be to drive NII on a dollar basis. But as I said, I do
expect some downward trajectory in NIM, and it's probably something on the order of single digits on a sequential
basis each quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then, Zach, when we look at – you're obviously expecting more loan growth than
deposit growth and fairly large issuance of sub debt this quarter. Could you walk us through the funding strategy?
I know you said you expect the overall growth in average earning assets, but what's the funding strategy? It
seems like you have to do much more than just on the deposit side and maybe what will be the cost of that.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's an important point and it's something that we feel like it's a point of strength and an advantage at
this point in the cycle, given that we're coming to the early to middle stages of this cycle at still a very
advantageous overall position in terms of loan to deposit ratio, the mix of important categories of deposits like
time deposits and our noncustomer funding kind of relative to history. And so it allows us, as I've mentioned on a
number of previous occasions, to utilize the balance source of funding.
If you look back at what happened in 2022, we grew loans at 10%, deposits were more than 2.5% range. Clearly,
loan to deposit ratios tracked up and we used a broad range of other funding sources like long-term debt, like the
FHLB and other noncustomer sources to balance out. The same is going to be true for 2023, albeit to a somewhat
less degree, thinking about loan growth in that mid to high-single digits range, 5% to 7%, deposit growth in the 1%
to 4% does imply we'll continue to see loan to deposit ratios tick up and you'll see us therefore continuing to utilize
other balanced funding sources like the Federal Home Loan Bank and other noncustomer sources of funding
there. The rates that we're seeing are pretty reasonable. The incremental economics certainly on that loan growth
continue very accretive to return on capital and the overall cost of deposits and funding within that beta
expectation [indiscernible] (00:30:59) NIM expectation that I just talked about...

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning. Hey, Zach, I wanted to ask you, I know we talked about this last quarter, the security swaps
that you had added a nice amount of net interest income again. And I'm just wondering, can you help us
understand just the benefit from that if ineffectiveness helped that again and just how does that grow? Like, well,
how do we track that going forward relative to just interest rates in terms of the benefits that you should get from
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. They were a very powerful benefit. I think they're protected as you know, about a third of what would've
otherwise been AOCI [indiscernible] (00:31:52) reduction, which was their primary intention originally, but also
have played out in terms of really strong reported yields on the securities portfolio. Roughly half of the
approximately 50 bps increase in securities yield was from that hedging program, to give you a sense of the
scale, and I think where it goes from here in terms of incremental benefit is going to be to some degree a function
of just where that mid portion of the curve goes. And at this point, it's fairly well topped out. I'm not expecting a ton
more lift there. The lift from that has reduced somewhat from the third quarter, but that's still very accretive. We're
not adding to that portfolio now. And so I think we're getting the benefits that we expected from it.

Okay. Great. And then one follow up on deposit beta, 17% total cumulative so far through the cycle, can you just

think you guys usually do talk on total.

Yeah, sure. So it was 17%. To give you a sense, just kind of tracking across time, it was 6% in Q2, 11% in Q3,
17% in Q4, so continuing to track and kind of in that additional 5% to 6% to 7% range each quarter. And the
expectation as we go out to Q1, it's going to be sort of more of the same, continuing out over until we get into the
middle part of the year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Our planning assumption, Ken, is something on the order of 35% total beta through the cycle, which would
indicate we're about halfway through to the prior point that I made. With that being said, I'll tell you, where we're
intently focused is on the day to day management of this and really very, very rigorous looking client by client in
the commercial portfolio, geography by geography in the consumer portfolio and ensuring that we can stay
competitive and ensure that we've got a strong deposit franchise. And so, we'll continue to wait and see and
manage against that. So if the outlook changes, we'll let you know, but at this point, it continues track according to
that broad expectation.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to...

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. You mentioned on slide 18 that you expect to be at the low end of your net charge-off range. The
tone very quickly changed this week from soft landing to hard landing. I guess my question here is, this may be
obvious to us that have covered the company for a while, but what makes you confident despite the deteriorating
economic outlook that you could stay at the low end of that already pretty low range. And given some of – there
was a, I wouldn't call them a peer, but there was a company that reported pretty eye-popping delinquency
numbers in auto this morning. I'm wondering if you could give us what's going on with auto credit trends
underneath. And again, re-remind us why you feel confident about how that portfolio would perform in an
economic downturn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Erika. It's Rich. Let me take that. I'll go with – I'll answer your second question first with respect to auto. So
we are seeing delinquencies in our portfolio. And again, remember, this is a prime and super prime portfolio. And
as we talked about at Investor Day, we've been in this business for decades and we've got very sophisticated
custom scorecards that we use in our client selection process. So, we feel very good about where are those
businesses today and it's been through numerous cycles and it's proven itself that it can outperform peers from a
loss content through various cycles. So we feel good about that.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
The delinquencies right now are right where we would expect them to be from a seasonal standpoint. If you go
back and you look at where delinquencies would have been in that 2018 and 2019 area, we're still trending below
those pre-COVID levels. So, we feel good there. And we've been very proactive as it relates to how we're
managing our loan to values in that space as well. So, I don't have any real concerns about our indirect auto
space. I feel very comfortable with how that business is growing.
With respect to the overall comfort that we have in our net charge-off forecast, I think it goes back to our customer
makeup. But, again, as I talked about at Investor Day, on the consumer side, we are overwhelmingly a secured
creditor. 95% of our loans are secured. And again, we've got that prime and super prime focus and high FICOs of
origination around 770. So it is a very strong book. And throughout all of that book, I know I just talked about auto,
but even RV/marine and resi, all of those portfolios are showing very well flows from delinquency standpoint. So
we feel good there.
On the commercial side, we have taken a lot of steps to reposition this book over the last several years, going
through into more specialty businesses, more larger companies, public companies. So we feel that we've
mitigated the loss content in that portfolio as well. So even though, as Zach pointed out, we're looking at more of a
mild recession than a severe landing, that's why we feel comfortable with where we are from a charge-off
forecast, that low end. Now, clearly, if the economy worsens, where we land within that range is going to depend
on where the economy goes and how the Fed reacts. But at this point, we're comfortable with where we put that
guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, Erika, this is Steve. Remember the guidance is through the cycle and we've been well below the through the
cycle average. And at this point, we're guiding to the lowest end of the range. And we've been strategic on how
we positioned the lending activities now for a dozen years. We've been very disciplined, Rich and team, along
with the lending teams have adhered to the disciplines, didn't open up in some of the areas [indiscernible]
(00:38:40) frothy and recent vintages. So we've got a really good core book on both the commercial side and as a
super prime and secured lender generally, on the consumer side, we actually think of that as a lower risk book.
So, our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile and discipline over many years will serve us well, certainly in auto
and frankly the entire portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you for that. And my second question is on that 6% to 9% PPNR growth medium term target. Clearly, you
expect to hit that this year. And I'm wondering, obviously, it gets more difficult if the Fed is cutting, which a lot of
investors expect for 2024, and maybe the question is, I know we'll hear more from you on this expense
management actions that you're taking, for which you will incur a restructuring charge. But is that an example of
the commitment that Huntington has to deliver this PPNR growth range with consistency over the medium term,
on an annual basis, even if the revenue tailwinds dissipate, like rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Erika, this is Zach. I'll take that one. And the answer to your question is yes. We – in terms of – that very much is
a sign of our trying to look ahead, look at not only 2023, but also over the entirety of the strategic planning horizon
and ensure that we're setting up the overall financial performance in terms of revenue and the growth rate of
13


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
overall expenses, such that we can achieve the objectives in terms of profit growth. That is a very deeply held
objective and we're not looking at short term, but the long term to achieve it.
So as we talked about a fair amount in the Investor Day, there are multiple strategic levers that we use to be able
to manage overall expenses to grow less than revenue to support that PPNR growth, even as we drive a faster
growth rate of the expenses – sorry, the investments within expenses to drive ultimately business growth over the
long term, but the efficiency drivers, Operation Accelerate that is going in reengineering major customer-facing
processes, taking waste and costs out of the system even if we improve productivity, our long track record of
optimizing the consumer and retail branch distribution network, which is still very relevant, still matters, but does
represent an opportunity over time to reduce and to harvest expense saves and things like this organizational
alignment, which are designed to help us to improve efficiency and hold cost growth at a low level.
I will note, it's in the guidance that I've given in terms of overall core expense growth for 2023, but importantly also
helps us to achieve our strategic objectives, align our organization yet even more toward our most important
strategic priorities and to operate as efficiently and at pace as we can. So we are extremely focused on driving
that long-term efficiency program, which is an important component of the PPNR guidance, and I do expect we'll
achieve the financial medium term targets this year, that's what's baked into and implied by our overall guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I think Erika, it's Steve. If I could add on just a bit, and as you'll remember from the Investor Day deck, we shared
a number of economic scenarios. And when we were asked a question and commented that we would take action
that the scenarios – if the economy worsens and the more challenging scenario emerge. We've already closed, I
think, 32 branches this month. We are taking action consistent with our prior statement and the commitment
around driving towards these medium-term financial goals. We're looking ahead as well to 2024 with how we're
positioning the reinvestment off of the expense actions. So team's doing a great job. It's a quick pivot, if you will,
from a record year and record quarter, but it's with a very clear set of actions and plan that we're executing.

Good morning.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a follow-up on Erika's first question, you guys talked about your buyback being on pause because you're
watching the path of the economy in the first half. You talked a little bit about the economic outlook since the
Investor Day was slightly worse, yet, Rich, you sound pretty confident. It feels like you feel good about your credit
outlook. Just help us square that a little bit more. Are you actually seeing erosion maybe outside of your portfolios
or help us understand your overall thinking because it seems like it's pretty positive from my view?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, I would say it's positive right now, and we're certainly cautious as we enter a downturn. But everything that
I'm looking at right now, Jon, is holding water exactly where we thought it would be. Our delinquencies, both in
commercial and consumer, are right where we would expect them to be. We had a very sharp drop in our
commercial delinquencies and our commercial real estate delinquencies are essentially nothing. The current class
NPA momentum that we've got, both down 20% year-over-year, puts us in a really good stead as we enter the
downturn.
So, we're looking at everything, every portfolio we're going deep into to make sure that we're proactive in
identifying potential issues and trying to get ahead of them in terms of working with customers and service
potential problems. But, certainly, the headwinds are there in the economy, but we feel good about where the
portfolio is positioned. Like I said, we're [indiscernible] (00:45:25). We do have higher losses forecasted in 2023
than we had in 2022. So we understand that's going to be more challenging environment, but we feel good where
we're sitting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then can you guys touch on – the one fee line that stood out was capital markets. Can you touch on
what you're seeing there? You talked about Capstone and then some of your other businesses. Are these
referrals coming to Capstone internally, is it business generated on their own, and what do you think there in
terms of the longer-term runway? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
In terms of – this is Zach, Jon. I'll take that one. Capital markets is a real bright spot for us. The core underlying
capital markets, excluding Capstone, grew 26% revenue year-over-year in 2022, and we expect another run rate
of double-digit teens or above revenue growth as we go into 2023. So we're seeing just really sustained traction,
and the underlying strategy there is to deepen relationships with additional clients, continue to penetrate that set
of services and products into our core customer base and reap the benefits of it. It's been an area, as you know,
we've been investing in considerably over time, and we're seeing that play through into incremental revenue
growth.
And then Capstone, to your point, is a nice addition to that. And I would tell you that Capstone is doing really,
really well. They beat the plan for Q3, overall, more than the $100 million run rate, if you look at the back half of
15


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
(HBAN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
revenues, I think look at the back half of 2022 and we expect that to continue and sustain and just continue to
grow as we go into 2023.
It's early days, I would say, in getting client referrals from the Huntington base, but it's beginning. We are seeing,
particularly as it relate to the pipeline and in the future, a lot of positive engagement of core Huntington clients
with the Capstone team and with the service set there. And so, it's going to be an area that just continues to bear
fruit and we're quite bullish about the opportunity to grow Capstone's what was previously $100 million revenue
run rate up into something that continues to perform well and above that as we go forward over time. So it's
definitely a strong point at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Add to that a little bit, Jon, if I can. So Capstone's had a good performance thus far. They had a very strong
pipeline coming into the year. Obviously, multiples have changed. Valuation is impacted by that. Timing becomes
a little more uncertain. But we're really pleased with that. The integration into the bank channels is going very,
very well.
The core businesses, foreign exchange, a record year, institutional sales and trading, commodities has had a very
good performance. So, a number of the businesses are doing very, very well at the core and expect that they'll
continue to show that the laggard is, as you would expect, the rates businesses, given the inverted curve but this
is an area of strategic growth for us. We're continuing to invest in it. And the integration of both Capstone and the
combined efforts of our core teams, which [indiscernible] (00:49:04) at the Investor Day make us very bullish
about 2023 and beyond.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. I just wanted to ask one back on credit, just sort of in light of your updated economic assumptions, what sort
of additional reserving needs do you think Huntington might have? I mean, you're already starting with 190-plus
reserve here. So, I mean, does that seem sufficient in light of what you're thinking or would it continue to drift
upward of it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Scott. It's Rich. I'll take that. So, as you saw, we held our coverage levels flat in the second quarter and then
we had two incremental builds in Q3 and Q4. So, the [ph] 190 basis points (00:49:57) coverage that we're sitting
with today we think is fully reflective of the current economic scenario. Now, where the reserve goes from there is
really going to be a function in the short term where the economy is heading, right. If we see significant
degradation, we'll have to react to that, or if it isn't as bad, we'll react there. So, it's hard to answer it.
We go through that process every quarter in terms of looking at the economic scenario that's in front of us and
what the potential for improvement and degradation is, and we make the call at the end of the quarter based on
all that. So, the near term is really going to depend on where the economy shakes out. I would say that, longer
term, as we get past the downturn however long it might be, we do think that we will bring that reserve coverage
down over time. It's just a question of the timing around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And then year-end reserve, Scott, reflects this adjusted thinking in terms of the baseline economic scenario with a

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you. And then, Zach, sort of a [ph] piggy-back (00:51:08) question, just the expense guidance for
the full year, I'm presuming that includes the restructuring charges to which you alluded earlier. I know you said
you'd talk in more detail about those later, but do you have maybe an approximate level of what we might expect
just to get a sense for what sort of underlying expense growth might look like from here on out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Scott, for asking the question. I want to take the opportunity to clarify. The guidance given is 2% to
4% growth in underlying core and then on top of that, the run rate for Capstone and Torana, which is around $60
million, plus the FDIC surcharge, we estimate to be $33 million to be relatively precise about that. We have not
17


Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
yet fully sized the potential restructuring costs from the organizational alignment actions that Steve mentioned. So
that is yet to be included in that guidance, just to put a very specific point on that.
And then I don't expect it to be overly large, but we'll have to see. Ultimately, it'll be a function of a number of
factors, including the final nature of the changes. And importantly, as Steve noted, we're instituting a voluntary
retirement program, which by its very name has a function of employee selection and take up on their own, and
so there'll be some degree of variability until we have a sense of where that program lay in. So that – more to
come on that. There's a few opportunities during the first quarter for us to provide additional updates around the
nature of the program, the size that we're on, and we intend to do that as we get further out into Q1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Appreciate the clarification.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
There's some pickup on that expense, that onetime expense that we would expect to see just in the run rate in
2023 and then maybe other things we could do to absorb that [ph] also not the (00:53:04) forecast.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just wanted to push on the buybacks. You've got almost 9.5% CET1 capital and you've got very
strong reserves. You've got very strong capital generation, solid loan growth, but not going to consume a ton of
capital. You seem pretty confident on credit. So I guess I'm just trying to better understand why you wouldn't buy
back stock in the first half? And then just to kind of throw it out there, it feels like the uncertainty might increase as
we look to the back half. So what would make you kind of more confidence to buy back in the second half,
heading into maybe more macro uncertainty?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, it's a good question. I think just take a step back broadly to frame it. The expectation now is, as we
get out over the course of the totality of 2023 and certainly as we think about 2024 and beyond to get back to a
more normal mix, overall payout ratios between dividends and share repurchases and retaining capital to grow,
and so I think you could see this buyback is – program, with the repurchase program is being indicative of that
part of that and I think a really healthy sign. When we thought a little more tactically, zooming in into the near
term, just really want to see the depth of the economic environment during the course of 2023 before we make
any substantive or significant commitments and I think hopefully the logic of that is understood.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
How long exactly does it take to get the clarity, to your point is somewhat uncertain, but I suspect we'll know a bit
more over the course of Q1 and as we get into Q2, if it's more resolved at that point, then I think we'd be more
active, but still highly uncertain, we'll have to see a new dynamic. But generally speaking, the size of the program
was designed to keep us in the middle of our CET1 operating range over the course of the preceding periods.
And so that will be our plan to generally manage in that way, ideally we'll get more clarity in the near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then as we think about potential uses of the capital besides buybacks, just remind us your appetite for
bolt-on deals, and I guess specifically within fees, right, because we kind of step back right now in net interest
income, maybe it's not peaking, but it's probably not going to be a key driver of growth as we get through this year
and beyond. And I know you guys have been talking about kind of better balancing some of that fee mix over
time. So what's the appetite to do something, whether smaller or maybe bigger than you have in the past? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Matt, it's Steve. We are interested in building our fee income opportunities in that revenue stream. And so if we
can find things that we think makes sense that would enhance our current business lines and/or what we can offer
to our customers, we'd be interested. Just as the last year, we were fortunate to get Capstone work and a fintech
payments firm called Torana. So we'll be looking as the year progresses whether it makes sense to bolster via
acquisition on the fee side of our businesses. But that's not sort of an intended set aside on that buyback
[indiscernible] (00:56:57) our capital priorities haven't changed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

with a lot of momentum. We think we're well positioned to manage through a mild recession, and we remain
