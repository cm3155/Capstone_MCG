Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
First quarter of 2023 was a memorable one for the banking industry, unfortunately highlighted by high profile bank
failures that caused dislocation across the system. The good news is that the industry remains fundamentally
strong and well capitalized, and the near-term view is less volatile than a month ago.
Webster's results in the quarter are reflective of our resilient business model and a shifting environment for
banking. We continue to deliver for our clients, and in the quarter, we prudently grew loans and core deposits. We
generated solid returns, and our asset quality profile remained effectively unchanged from the prior quarter.
On an adjusted basis, we generated EPS of $1.49. In light of the market dislocation and out of an abundance of
caution, we took actions to augment our balance sheet liquidity, including increasing our cash position and
utilizing higher-cost funding sources. We also saw a decline in fees as a result of reduced direct investment gains
and overall client financing activities, among other effects.
Due to these actions and some seasonal factors, our PPNR was down 6.6% from the prior quarter. Our adjusted
ROAA of 1.46% was up from 1.37% a year ago, and our return on tangible common equity was a strong 21%, up
from 17% last year. Loans grew 2% on a linked quarter basis with a focus on strategic categories with attractive
risk profiles. Our total deposits were up 2%, also on a linked quarter basis with core deposits up 4%.
While it seems like ages ago, many of you attended our Investor Day on March 2, just days before the market
disruption. During that event, we provided a transparent look at our go-forward strategies and differentiated
businesses with a focus on our unique funding profile and credit and risk management practices, all of which are
especially beneficial during times of stress and uncertainty. While I'll touch again on some of the points we made
in early March, I would encourage you to revisit the Investor Day presentation and webcast that are posted on our
website as we believe the attributes we outlined will continue to benefit our company and drive outperformance
regardless of the operating environment.
Let me spend just a minute on deposit and deposit trends and then provide you with an update on our office
portfolio, two topics that I know are of significant interest. I'm on page 3 of our presentation. The unique qualities
of our deposit franchise remain a core strength of Webster. Our deposits consist of $24 billion of consumer
deposits, largely originated in our retail footprint to long tenured clients. $8 billion of HSA Bank deposits, the
entirety of these deposits are individual customer accounts and nearly all are within FDIC insurance coverage
limits. And as you know, HSA deposits are long duration and low cost. $2 billion of business banking deposits
within our Commercial Bank. Generally, these are smaller dollar and behave similarly to those in the consumer
book. $5 billion of public fund deposits within the Commercial Bank, the majority of which are collateralized with
highly predictable behavioral characteristics.
Our remaining commercial deposits of $11 billion are diverse by industry, customer type and geography. There
are no sector concentrations, and these deposits are relatively small balance in nature with an average balance of
less than $200,000 per account. I refer you again to Chris Motl's presentation at Investor Day where we broke
down the multiple deposit generating businesses in our Commercial Bank franchise.
And finally, interLINK, the acquisition of which we completed in the first quarter, has already proven to be highly
valuable, provides readily available core deposit funding to almost all FDIC insured deposits. And we have access
to these funds at a very low cost of acquisition.
In summary, between the Consumer Bank, HSA and interLINK, 63% of our total deposit accounts are consumer-
oriented small balance accounts that are long duration in nature.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
The past month of deposit activity highlights the tremendous value of our deposit franchise. Customer activity
within the Consumer Bank and HSA was business as usual throughout the entire quarter, and both of these
categories grew in Q1.
In mid-March, within the Commercial Bank, we saw elevated two-way activity for a few days as clients looked to
diversify their deposit concentrations, but that activity quickly resumed its normal course. I would also note that we
have opened approximately 500 accounts, primarily operating accounts that are in the process of being funded
with new commercial depositors since the middle of March.
In addition to the strength of our overall deposit franchise, we maintained significant alternate sources of liquidity.
This is displayed on slide 4. As of yesterday, we had $16 billion of immediately available liquidity between cash
balances and undrawn borrowing facilities. This represents 118% of our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits.
We expect this ratio will continue to grow over the short term.
As it relates to credit, at Investor Day, Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer, detailed the quality of our loan
portfolio. We are proud of our credit risk framework and our risk selection. For many quarters, our origination
efforts have been focused on existing customers and higher-rated loans. Our strict underwriting standards include
stress testing, economic and interest rate sensitivity, and we continue to perform robust reviews of portfolio
segments that are sensitive to environmental trends.
We proactively sold loans last year where we believed it would maximize our economics and help reduce future
credit risk. The net result of all of our actions is that the weighted average risk rating in our loan portfolio has
improved over the past year, each quarter, and is unchanged on a linked quarter basis. As you will see in our
disclosures, the level of classified assets in our portfolio has remained stable as well.
On slide 5, we have refreshed and augmented our disclosures on our office portfolio. As you can see, our
nonmedical office portfolio represents just 2.8% of total loans, has a low at-origination LTV, a strong current and
updated debt service coverage ratio profile, has limited lease maturities, and each of the next two years is
diversified across geographies, and thus far continues to perform well. In fact, criticized assets have fallen to
4.7% of loans from 6.6% of loans in the fourth quarter of 2022.
I'll also remind you that the $1.4 billion in office exposure is down $260 million or 15% from the close our MOE as
we were proactive in managing this portfolio during 2022. And we've originated only a nominal amount of office
exposure since the two banks came together a year ago.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn to review the financial statements in more detail.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 6 with our GAAP in adjusted earnings.
We reported GAAP net income to common shareholders of $217 million with earnings per share of $1.24. On an
adjusted basis, we reported net income to common shareholders of $259 million and EPS of $1.49 after excluding
one-time after-tax expenses of $42 million. Merger expenses were related to professional fees, severance and
other compensation-related charges, and a provision adjustment for acquired unfunded lending commitments.
The strategic initiative expense is related to repositioning of our securities portfolio.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Next, I'll review balance sheet trends beginning on slide 7. Total assets were $74.8 billion at period end, up of
$3.6 billion from the fourth quarter as we bolstered our balance sheet liquidity and had $1.2 billion in loan growth.
Our securities balance increased modestly in the quarter. As discussed at our Investor Day, we sold $400 million
in lower yield securities in January, recording a loss on sale. The proceeds were used to purchase higher yielding
securities, resulting in an earn back of less than one year.
AOCI attributed to unrealized losses against our AFS portfolio improved to $560 million from $631 million last
quarter. In a steady interest rate environment, we anticipate roughly $85 million of this will accrete back into
capital annually. Loan growth was $1.2 billion, driven primarily by Commercial Banking. Deposits were up $1.2
billion from quarter end, reflective of growth in interLINK, HSA, and our CD portfolio and matched our quarterly
loan growth. From quarter end through April 19, deposits have grown another $2.8 billion. Borrowings increased
by $2.3 billion as we enhanced our liquidity position in light of recent market events. Our borrowings included $8.6
billion of FHLB advances.
While we continue to enhance our liquidity profile, as the funding rate environment stabilizes, we anticipate
holding more normalized levels of cash while replacing wholesale borrowings with deposit funding. Our capital
levels remain strong, as evidenced by our common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.4% and a tangible common equity ratio
of 7.15%. And lastly, we continue to grow tangible book value, which ended the quarter at $29.47 per share.
Loan trends are highlighted on slide 8. In total, we grew loans by $1.2 billion, or 2.3% on a linked quarter basis.
Loan growth was diverse by category. Commercial grew by $540 million, commercial real estate grew by $900
million, and residential mortgage balances were up modestly. The yield on the portfolio increased 55 basis points
as loan yield outpaced increases in deposit costs. Excluding accretion, loan yields increased by 56 basis points.
Floating and periodic rate loans remained approximately 60% at quarter end.
We provide additional detail on deposits on slide 9, with total deposits of $1.2 billion from prior quarter, or 2.3%. In
addition to growth in interLINK and HSA, we added $370 million in CDs. Our total deposit costs were up 51 basis
points to 111 basis points for a cumulative cycle-to-date beta of 24%. It's worth repeating that between Consumer,
HSA and interLINK, 63% of our deposits are in consumer-oriented long duration categories and, to a large extent,
fully FDIC insured.
In our HSA business, the average account balance is under $3,000. In Consumer Banking, our average account
balance is under $25,000. And in Commercial Bank, our average account balance is under $200,000.
On slide 10, you see the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions. We anticipate our total cycle-to-
date deposit beta will increase to 38% by the first quarter of 2024, with a more significant ramp in the second
quarter, followed by fairly steady progression throughout the remainder of the year.
Moving to slide 11, you can see our reported to adjusted income statement compared to the adjusted earnings for
the fourth quarter of 2022. Net interest income was down $7.1 million, or 1.2% linked quarter, reflecting a shorter
day count and a funding mix shift inclusive of the actions to augment our liquidity. Adjusted fees were down $19
million, while expenses remained effectively flat. I'll provide additional line item detail on subsequent slides. The
net interest margin was 3.66%, down 8 basis points from the prior quarter, and our efficiency ratio was 42%.
On slide 12, net interest income was down $7.1 million linked quarter, or 1.2%. Day count was roughly 2% – a 2%
headwind to net interest income growth quarter-over-quarter. Excluding accretion income, net interest income
would have been down $4.4 million, or just 0.7%. Net interest margin excluding accretion decreased 6 basis
points from the prior quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
While yield on earning assets excluding accretion increased 50 basis points over the prior quarter, the decline in
NIM was driven by higher funding costs as we enhanced our liquidity position. Total cost of funds was up 60 basis
points quarter-over-quarter.
Slide 13, which highlight our fee income for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, fees were down $19 million linked
quarter. The primary drivers of the decline were lower direct investment income, lower client hedging activity and
valuation marks, and lower client contract fees. I will detail our outlook for the year later in my remarks, but we
expect to recapture a portion of the hedging and valuation mark, as well as the direct investment income as we
move through 2023.
Non-interest expenses are highlighted on slide 14. We reported an adjusted expense of $303 million in line with
prior quarter. The results reflect lower compensation and marketing expenses, which were offset by an increase
in the FDIC assessment rate, intangible amortization on interLINK, and operating costs associated with strategic
investments including the Bend and interLINK acquisitions.
Slide 15 details components of our allowance for credit losses, which was up $19 million over prior quarter. After
recording $25 million in net charge-offs, we incurred $38 million in provision expense with loan growth
representing $12 million and the macro and credit factors of $26 million. Additionally, we completed the adoption
of the TDR accounting rules effective January 1 of this year. This resulted in a $6 million increase in reserve,
which was recorded as a charge to retained earnings. As a result, you'll see our coverage ratio increased
modestly to 1.21%.
Slide 16 highlights our key asset quality metrics. On the upper left, nonperforming assets declined $19 million
from prior quarter and represent 36 basis points of loans. Commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial
loans declined to 1.47% from 1.5% despite a modest increase of $6 million on an absolute basis. Net charge-offs
on the upper right totaled $25 million or 20 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis.
On slide 17, we continue to exhibit strong capital levels. All capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and
internal targets. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 10.4%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 7.15%. Our
tangible book value per share increased to $29.47 a share, and $29.07 in the last quarter. Including both AFS and
HTM marks on our securities portfolio, our TCE ratio would be approximately 6.4%, and our common equity tier 1
ratio would be approximately 8.4%, both as of March 31.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 18 with our full-year outlook for 2023. We expect loans to grow in the range of
4% to 6%, with growth focused in strategic segments. We expect a full-year core deposit growth of 8% to 10%,
with a year-end loan-to-deposit ratio in the range of 85% and 90%.
We expect net interest income of $2.375 billion to $2.425 billion on a non-FTE basis, excluding accretion. We
expect $25 million in accretion would be added to that interest income outlook. For those modeling our net
interest income on an FTE basis, I would add roughly $65 million to the outlook. Our net interest income outlook
includes the growth expectations above, along with a 25-basis point rate hike in May. We assume that Fed fund
rate remains flat for the remainder of 2023 at 5.25%.
Fee income should be in a range of $375 million to $400 million. Core expenses are expected to be $1.2 billion or
$1.225 billion, with an efficiency ratio of roughly 40%. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22%
to 23%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
We continue to be prudent managers of capital. Capital actions will be dependent on the market environment. We
continue to target a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.5% over time.
With that, I'll turn it back over to John for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, Glenn.
On page 19, I'll briefly hit on the next steps of our merger integration as we have or soon-to-complete the largest
aspects of bringing our company together. Most notably, our core conversion is approaching in a few months'
time. We successfully ran our first mock conversion last weekend and have several others planned through our
go-live date. The list of additional integration activities outstanding is short as we approach our core conversion,
though we will continue to use the scale of our platform to invest in our technology, people, and continuing to
improve the client experience.
We're fortunate to operate from a position of strength. Our interest rate risk management, diversity of funding and
growing deposit base, efficient operations and ability to invest in our platform position us well for the future. We
maintain high levels of capital both on a stated and marked basis, and exhibit robust internal capital generation,
and the ability to consistently grow tangible book value per share going forward. While the shift in operating
environment will weigh on our NIM to a degree, our loan yields continue to reprice higher, and we will continue to
lock in the benefits of a higher interest rate environment.
The full-year guidance we provided today is based on our best thinking around our base case for the impact of
macro factors. And it's too early to anticipate all the effects of the recent events, including future regulatory costs
or the depth of a potential recession later in the year. With that said, it's our strategic aim to ensure we continue to
position our bank to support our key clients and business segments through any operating environment. We'll
continue to prudently grow loans and add franchise, enhancing full relationships all within the confines of the
credit, economic and funding environment. This will likely mean closer scrutiny of new and existing businesses
and continued focus on funding loans with growing core deposits. We'll continue to be good stewards of capital,
and we'll manage our balance sheet in an efficient and prudent manner, depending on the environmental
opportunities and/or challenges.
In summary, we expect we will continue to generate return to the top of our peer group, thanks to the strength I've
highlighted today. I want to make this important point. We believe that based on our guidance we provided, our
year-end performance metrics will continue to meet or exceed the targets we set forth not only at merger
announcement, but at Investor Day last month. That's an ROATCE of approximately 20%, an ROAA in 1.5%
range, and efficiency ratio around 40%. We believe those metrics will still be kind of best-in-class in our peer
group.
Thank you to our colleagues for their exceptional work in this quarter. They made special efforts to engage and
stay in front of our clients and have kept our organization operating at a high level through an unusual period.
And before I conclude, I just want to express our support for our colleagues at Old National Bank after the events
that took place earlier this month in Louisville. We know a number of individuals there. They run an organization
of very strong character. And we want Jim Ryan and their entire team to know that Webster and the rest of the
industry has them in our thoughts.

Hey, John. Just want to make sure the 20% ROATCE, the 1.50%, and the 40%, what was the time period again?
Just want to make sure I got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A

The two years merger, so think fourth quarter 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. In terms of the balance sheet, could you help us with just your expectations for interLINK from here,
how much you're going to continue to pull on that? I mean, maybe the implications for borrowings, and ultimately,
where you wanted the loan-to-deposit to settle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey. So, Chris, let me take that. It's Glenn. Good morning. So, we think that the interLINK will probably
close the year closer to $5 billion right now. And so, November – as of now, we're at almost $3.5 billion as of
yesterday. So, we're well on the path there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
And, Chris, we've talked about the beauty of that as it's a lever we can pull, adjust it down from an accordion
perspective. So, if we continue to see momentum out of the business lines with respect to deposit growth, we can
throttle that down. But it's a wonderful tool to have particularly in this environment.

And then just lastly on the buyback, obviously, lot of your peers [indiscernible] (00:22:28) macro uncertainty. I
guess, where do you shake out in terms of thinking about this in terms of timing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's great. Obviously, with the uncertainty in the market, we – in the first quarter, we weren't active,
and in the second quarter, we'll likely won't be. But we do believe in our model now and our base case of what's
going to happen in the macro environment as things settle that there'll be several hundred million dollars in
buybacks in the third and fourth quarter. But again, I always want to caveat that with the fact that we'll be prudent
given the environment that we'll be in. But certainly, at this valuation, it's an attractive investment for us to return
capital that way.

Casey Haire Q

A couple of questions on the expense front. So, the strategic expenses up on the quarter, was any of that relating
to the control issues around – that caused the 10-K delay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. The answer is no. It has to do with what we're doing with respect to our conversion and other merger
related charges. So, we have not had material expense increases related to resolution of the MW. And we're well
on the path of remediation of all that too. So, it's not going to pop anywhere.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So, consistent with what you guys talked about at Investor Day. This is not going to have a – is not going to lead
to a meaningful impact on expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
No, no.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And just following up. So, the efficiency ratio, 42% in the first quarter. You guys are still shooting for that
40% level, which implies a sub 40% efficiency ratio in the remaining quarters despite you're keeping your expense
guide the same, but you've taken down your revenue. So, I'm just trying to square what appears to be a tougher
outlook and still holding that efficiency ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So, you saw our expenses for the first quarter at $303 million, basically flat quarter-over-quarter. So, we
think we have some opportunity there. But I think as you push it forward, we still feel good about operating in the
40% range. So, we were a little elevated this quarter. And I think it'll play off fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Casey, if you, again, look at the middle ranges of our guidance, I think that comes out to about a 41%, so
kind of flat. And I said around 40% with our targets. I think we do have opportunities and levers to pull once we
get through conversion on expenses. And so, I think that's where we'll be right in that 40% – low 40s, 40% range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Very good. Thank you. And just last one. Any commentary on HSA, up 6% year-over-year? I think that's a little bit
lighter than what you guys talked about in Investor Day. Although, John, I agree with you, that seems like a long
time ago now. But just color on a mid-single-digit growth rate in HSA year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think we're – where we are is kind of – the industry growth slowed a little bit. We're pretty happy with where
we are with respect to year-over-year and the first quarter growth. So, I would say, I don't think it's anything
unusual, Casey. We're still bullish. It's very difficult to find deposit growth in the high-single digits on low-cost
deposits. So, nothing unusual. And actually, I think we had a pretty good quarter relative to what Devenir – and
year-over-year relative to what Devenir showed in terms of industry growth.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Good morning. I wanted to touch on credit. First, could you just give us some sense on loan resets for commercial
real estate? What is the average kind of change in loan yield for loans coming out of, I'd assume, 2018, 2019
vintages to today? And what kind of impact does that have on debt service coverage ratios?
And then the second question I have is just same type of profile, right, 2018 or 2019 vintages to today. What's
kind of the average change in cap rates that you're using when you underwrite those properties? And how are
borrowers behaving and reacting to these changes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting. It's hard to give sort of a blanket response to that because what we're seeing is in
maturities, obviously, what we're doing is we're renegotiating with borrowers. They're putting in either more
proceeds, or rates are increasing if we're taking a little bit more risk on the LTV and debt service coverage ratios.
I'm trying to pull up some data I have around – I think we're a couple hundred basis points up from a cap rate
perspective. 6.2% was our kind of all-in yield. That's probably up – in March in commercial real estate, that's
probably up 250 basis points since the 2018 and 2019 range. And that's kind of what we're originating now.
I'd say some of the research we have, Matt, shows that, like, if a 10% decline in NOI increases – I'm sorry,
impacts DCR about 17 basis points – I'm trying to think of my LTV number that I had here. Give me one second.
Oh, 100 basis point increase in cap rates increases LTVs by about 10% to 12% in our portfolio as we've been
going down and reviewing all of those dynamics.
So, what I would say is, we're not seeing any issues with respect to current debt service coverage on our
commercial real estate. And as it's coming up for renewal, we've been taking really aggressive, proactive steps to
either rightsize the proceeds or work with the borrower to get additional enhancements if we're settling for a lower
debt service coverage ratio and a higher LTV.
So, so far if you look at all of our asset classes – we gave you a lot in office – we're in pretty good shape there.
And I think on one of the slides in office, we showed the maturities left this year. We've already kind of resolved
about $200 million in maturities in office in 2023. And we did that by either getting additional credit enhancements,
paying down the proceeds and working and getting additional equity from our borrowers. And obviously, as we're
settling those at the new yield, we're still comfortable that we've got reasonable debt service coverage and we're
still within LTVs.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay. Thank you. And then I was hoping you could just talk about the New York City market in the
wake of Signature and everything going now with some of the other players in that market being dislocated. Does
it change your view of how you attack or kind of man the field in regards to New York City? What kind of
opportunity is there to take market share in the wake of this disruption?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I guess we look at it two ways, right? So, you think about managing from a credit perspective all of our New
York City real estate exposure. And I think the critical thing is we look again at having strong borrowers, strong
sponsors, strong property, and conservatively underwritten loans. And so, while obviously we believe that they'll
be stressed particularly with the loans that Signature Bank will be selling and that New York Community Bank

didn't buy, we're not too worried about the impact on the overall market as long as we've got really good sponsors
standing behind their properties and we're able to work through borrowers.
And as we said, in our commercial real estate portfolio in New York, there's no cliff there, right? We've got limited
maturities, strong lease flows, good LTVs. And so, we're working with each of our individual borrowers as we
move forward.
I think as the dust settles, Matt, and we think about opportunities in the market, we do believe that there'll be
potentially teams available. We do believe that there'll be high-quality transactions available to us. I think, right
now, if you think about what our management team has been focused on for the last quarter, it's obviously what
you'd want us to be focused on, which is making sure that we've got strong liquidity, that we're looking at our own
credit, and that we're thinking about how we're going to be able to react in the future and how much flexibility we
have.
Given our funding advantage, given the fact that we think we can continue to grow deposits, I think we will
opportunistically take share, but we want to make sure we're doing it in asset classes we think are strong, with the
right relationships and at the right time. So, I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to smartly grow our
book there, but we're also very cognizant of the market dynamics in New York right now, the potential for a
recession at the end of the year.
So, what I'd say is, yes, opportunity in the future, but really prudent about how we go about deciding where and
when to take that share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Understood. Last one for me just on the interest rate sensitivity. I see in the down rate 100-basis point
scenario. I think NII is down now about 2.8%. This is off from, I think, 3% at year-end.
As you continue to move the ball forward on this front, by the time we do get to 2024 and potentially close to rate
cuts, where do you expect the balance sheet sensitivity on this metric to be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, let me take that, Matt. So, you probably see on the same chart, I think you're back on page 28 or so,
that we've continued for – we continue to reduce our asset sensitivity. And so, we've done some things that we've
talked about at Investor Day of loan swaps, collars, and things like that. So, we continue to manage that down. I
don't think we'll be at a neutral point, but I think we continue just to work that down.

Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tamayo from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just one question for me. I think, Glenn, you mentioned that you expect to hold a higher percentage of normalized
excess cash kind of going forward. Curious if that's similar to the amount that you're holding now or if you expect
that to grow and kind of the timeframe where you think that might have to stay on the balance sheet. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So, thank you and good morning. So, we are holding right now elevated cash levels. And I think over the
course of the next couple of quarters, we'll manage that down to a more normalized level and say that level is
about $1 billion as opposed to, I think, in the quarter were $2.2 billion.
I think you'll see that elevated in the second quarter a little bit because that's – we only closed out the quarter. So,
we continue to build some cash balances, but we'll continue to manage that down for the remainder of the year.
And, obviously, that has implications from a NIM standpoint, right? Because it's basically – it doesn't – it drives
two charges from NIM. So, you'll see probably a little bit more NIM compression in the third quarter. But then as
we deploy that cash and draw it down, then it should come back up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q

Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Mark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
First question I had. You had about $900 million in commercial real estate growth in the first quarter. Was any
particular concentrations that came in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
It wasn't – I can tell you, again, office is obviously disfavored. But if you think about kind of multifamily across our
footprint, industrial, mixed use, that's kind of where it is, Mark, and pretty spread across geographies. The other
interesting thing about commercial real estate, and quite frankly, all loan growth in the quarter, Mark, is that
prepays were down significantly. So, our originations were actually down materially from a year ago. But
obviously, market conditions are having it so that properties aren't trading in the regular C&I. And in the sponsor
book, the transaction volume is not as high. So, I just throw that in there for context that to get $900 million of
growth in the quarter, the level of originations did not have to be nearly as high as it was a year ago where there
was a lot more prepayments as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, secondly, I'm curious if you're seeing any pressure to boost HSA deposit rates. And is your
modeling assuming that your deposit costs there stay at around 15 basis points going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yes. So, we are modeling at 15 basis points. You probably saw, two quarters ago, we did increase the rate. So, it
went from like a 9 basis points or 10 basis points to 15 basis points. But as far as the data on that is at the very
low end of the range. So, it's one of those – obviously, one of those funding sources that are really important to us
at a time like now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, lastly, I saw in some of the local papers here in Connecticut that you expect – you had a
customer data breach. I wondered if you could share with us whether that's likely to result in a large charge in
coming quarters.

John R. Ciulla A

Yeah. We actually, Mark, don't think there'll be any financial impact to us. As we said, it's a third-party vendor that
we use for fraud monitoring that experienced the data security incident and had the release of our information,
and we've communicated with regulators and clients. None of our systems were impacted, and we believe that
there will be no material financial impact to Webster with respect to all aspects of putting that behind us.

open.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, John. Good morning, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, I wanted to start, in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank, can you walk us through what happened to your
deposit base? John, I thought you said there were inflows and outflows. And I'm particularly curious on the
Sterling side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Interestingly, there was no differentiation really between the two legacy banks, which I hate to say at this
juncture into our deal. And so, behaviorally, Steve, what we saw across the new Webster was the same across
our footprint, which was, as I mentioned, business as usual in Consumer and HSA. We literally grew organically
our consumer deposits across our branch footprint, which was a terrific job by the team there.
In Commercial, across all of our relationships and across all of our business lines, we had a handful of large
deposit commercial customers, think $200 million, $100 million, who either from pressure from their board or a

not-for-profit, they had a board that pushed on fiduciary duty. And, obviously, I'm sure you're hearing this from
everyone else. In those two or three days, that moved a portion of those deposits likely to where you work, Steve,
to JPM or the like.
And the interesting points there, Steve, no one closed accounts. No one drove their balances down to the FDIC
insurance limits. They took $100 million deposits, a $50 million or $200 million deposit to $100 million deposit.
And the more sophisticated borrowers and the larger corporate borrowers were the ones that kind of acted the
most from that fiduciary. We've seen – that settle down really, really quickly. And you can see it in our numbers.
Our commercial deposits were down some quarter-to-quarter. We're seeing some of that flow back. We're also
seeing a significant amount of new deposit openings. And I don't like to attribute it to the two bank failures, but
obviously, activities in our footprint, there are people that are reaching out to us. And so, we've got opportunity as
we fund those accounts to grow our commercial deposits again.
So, it was shorter lived than we thought with respect to the unusual activity. We did see some level of outflow,
which quickly stabilized. And now, we're on a trajectory where we think we'll continue to grow our core
commercial deposits and no difference across geography or legacy bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Very helpful, actually. If I could shift to the loan side. So, the downshift in loan growth, which
is modest, right? You took the ranges down by 2% each. But how much of that is tied to you guys tightening the
credit box first, just assuming there'll be less demand in the market just given the economic outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
It's a great question. I talked about this yesterday, Steve. I think there are three implications. Number one, and
probably most importantly, to put a fine point on your question, we probably lowered the guidance because of
organic lower Fed H.8 loan demand. So, the market there is less loan demand, and that's going to be a driver.
Two, I don't know whether it's us shrinking the credit box, but as we get into a more cyclical time, potential
recession, a little more choppiness, obviously, we're less inclined to lend into those industries that have significant
cyclicality and maybe others that are under pressure. So, that has the impact of sort of shrinking the credit box;
maybe not tightening standards, but shrinking the credit box.
And then, obviously, as it relates to liquidity and as liquidity continues to flow out of the industry, I think that'll have
an impact on everyone's loan growth as they get a little bit more selective and prioritize existing customers over
maybe new customers or national businesses that don't have deposit relationships with them. So, I think that's in
the order of prioritization the three things that will have us going from a high-single digits to mid-single digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's great. And maybe one last one for Glenn around the margin. So, if the Fed starts cutting rates
at some point – and I know your outlook is rates flat for the rest of the year, but let's say they assume cut – start
cutting either second half of this year or early next year, how do you think about the delay, the lag in terms of
either months or percentage of rate change we need before you could start reducing the cost of interest-bearing
deposits?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
On the deposit side, so I think – look, I think if you look at our deposit beta, we've lagged like two quarters or so in
rate increases. But I think on the way down, as the Fed begins to cut, it's probably within three months, you begin
to see it pretty quickly. So, I think the reaction on the way down would be more significant than the lag on the way
up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Perfect. So that – Glenn, if we did see that play out for the second half, we saw two rate cuts, would that
materially impact this 38% terminal beta you're calling out or would it not be material?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
No. Well, it depends on where you see it in the second half. I mean, we're thinking in the first quarter, we'd see a
rate reduction. So, it probably – if it's in the fourth quarter, you'd probably won't see as much, right, because it'd
be like 30 days or something like that, 60 days before you saw anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
I think what you're seeing here, Steve, is that this is the deposit base catching up along with growth in our deposit
base in part because of shoring up the balance sheet from a liquidity standpoint with things like interLINK, broker
CDs and stuff like that. So, that's really what's driving it.
And I think if you're thinking about it from a margin standpoint, like I said before, there'll be some pressure in Q2
because we're [ph] holding what's (00:43:20) excess cash, which is the prudent thing to do. But then as we get
more clarity on the future in the next couple of quarters, we'll manage that down. And so, you'll see the margin
come back up.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. It's Zach on for Brody. My question is just around the 20 basis points in charge-offs. Could you provide any
color on what loan categories drove that number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Mostly commercial. So, if you think about our $24 million, $25 million in credit charge-offs in the quarter,
Zach, just to give you some – because we've been talking about this the last several quarters. About $7 million of
that were related to strategic loan sales, about $350 million in the quarter. So, obviously, very, very small discount
on balance sheet optimization and proactive credit monitoring. The rest of the $18 million or so were all in about
four commercial credits with, actually, I think, four different business lines with no kind of correlated risk in terms
of – or anything that we're seeing with respect to sector or industry or geography.
And that 19 basis points annualized charge-off rate is actually at or slightly below our pre-pandemic annualized
charge-off rate. So, we felt like it was another good quarter, and I just wanted to give you that differentiation of the
$7 million of those charge-offs that were done through proactive loan sales by us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary Westerlind Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Thank you. And then just one other quick one for me. On the securities growth, could you just
provide, if you're able to, new purchase yields versus what's rolling off the book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, I think when we purchased that, it was a little over 6%, say, 6.13%, somewhere around there, and what came
off was at about 3.11%. So, there's about $200 million that came off and about $900 million that went on. And in
addition to that, we had, as I said in my prepared remarks, about $400 million in restructuring that we did, so
security sales effectively. And those were at about 60 or 70 basis points.

Hey, guys. Good morning.

John R. Ciulla A

Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Just looking at the quarter-to-date deposit growth, can you give the composition of where you were seeing
that, I guess, especially the contributions from Brio and interLINK? And then, to get to that higher 38% terminal
beta, are you expecting higher contributions from Brio and interLINK than, I guess, you were assuming before?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, for the – is your question about from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, Jared?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, I guess both. Yeah. And then what you've seen – what you called out as seeing so far in April.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, yeah. So, interLINK itself was – for the first quarter was $2.8 billion of the growth. So, basically, that's from
$0 to $2.8 billion. So, that was a big driver. The offset to that was we let some of the broker deposits run off. So,
they went from like $1.4 billion to $672 million, right? And then, the other areas where we saw growth, as I said in
my prepared remarks, were in like certificates of deposit that were up about $1 billion. And those were long dated,
a little over 4% retail type of CDs. So, that's how we ended the first quarter.
As I said in the prepared remarks, we're actually up in the second quarter by another $2.8 billion. And a big piece
of that, and I would say, about $500 million or $600 million of that is interLINK again, and then the remainder is
primarily brokered CDs.
And our idea with that – and there's some commercial growth, as John indicated. There's continued retail growth.
But in big chunks, that's what it is. And so, that we're using to pay down basically some FHLB borrowings and
things like that. So, it's sort of cost neutral from a NIM standpoint and things like that, but it also provides us more
off balance sheet liquidity, if you think of it that way. And so, we wanted to make sure we preserve the optionality
of that.
And then the other dynamic, as I said a few times, is that we're managing down cash. And so, you would expect
to see our FHLB borrowings to come down. The growth in interLINK as we go through the year, broker deposits
will probably flatten out because I think we have other sources of funding that we'll get, whether it's BrioDirect or
things like that. So, I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it.

...and money market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
So, interLINK is in money market, but I would point you to our slide – the slide presentation because we broke it
out there. So, if you look on page 9 of our presentation, you can see the interLINK piece. So, we sort of broke it
out by product type and then by line of business.
And so, you see in the corporate piece, which is the treasury piece, and John actually had it in his slide as well,
the net difference between interLINK and whatever else is basically wholesale funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just finally on interLINK, the cost of that for the quarter, is that similar to FHLB? I guess, where is the
cost on that [indiscernible] (00:49:30)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's like Fed funds. It's like 5% Fed funds plus 15%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Glenn I. MacInnes A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure.
