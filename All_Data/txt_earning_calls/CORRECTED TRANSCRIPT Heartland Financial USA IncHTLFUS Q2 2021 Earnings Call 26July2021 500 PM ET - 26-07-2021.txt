Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
For the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the call over to HTLF's President
and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance. Then Bryan McKeag, our EVP and CFO, will provide
additional color around HTLF's results. Also joining us today is Nathan Jones, EVP and Chief Credit Officer, who
will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Now on to the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2021, I'm very pleased to report that we had an
extremely strong second quarter following a very good first quarter. We set a new record for net income in the
second quarter at $61.6 million. And after our preferred dividend of $2 million, net income available to common
shareholders was $59.6 million, compared to $30 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $29.5
million or a 98% increase.
Year-to-date net income of $110.4 million was 102% (sic) [120%] increase over the first six months of last year.
We also set a new record for diluted earnings per common share for the quarter of $1.41, compared to $0.82 for
the second quarter of last year, an increase of $0.59 or 72%. Year-to-date earnings per share is $2.61.
While annualized return on average common equity and average tangible common equity for the quarter was
12.07% and 18.05%, respectively, year-to-date, that's 11.29% and 16.99%, respectively. Annualized return on
average assets for the quarter was 1.35% and, year-to-date, 1.27%.
The net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.41% for the quarter and 3.45% year-to-date. Our
efficiency ratio was 57.11%; year-to-date, 56.86%, and Bruce and Bryan will share more detail in their comments.
Book value and tangible book value per common share continue to increase, ending the quarter at $48.50 and
$33.98, respectively; and that's a 9% increase for both from a year ago. Tangible common equity ended the
quarter at 8.08%, in line with our goal of between 8% and 9%.
Well, given our record quarterly performance, history of growth, great credit fundamentals, and strong liquidity
position relative to peers, we share our analysts' optimism on their price indications.
Well, on the M&A front, we continue to have a very deep pipeline of acquisition opportunities across our footprint,
with a number of active opportunities currently in process. Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that Shelley
Reed joined our M&A team as EVP of Corporate Strategy & Development in June. With over 20 years in the
financial services industry, including 15 years of investment banking experience, Shelley has an extremely
extensive background with all related aspects of buy-side and sell-side mergers and acquisitions.
Well, at this month's board meeting, HTLF's board of directors approved a $0.25 per common share dividend.
That's nearly a 14% increase, payable August 30, 2021, to shareholders of record on August 16, 2021. The board
also approved a preferred dividend of $175 payable on October 15, 2021, to shareholders of record on
September 30, 2021.
And last, at our annual stockholder meeting in May, we elected two new Class I independent directors: Kathryn
Graves Unger and Chris Hylen. Also elected as Class I directors were Susan Murphy, Marty Schmitz and myself.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, HTLF's President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the company's
operating performance and credit. Bruce?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to share with you HTLF's record second quarter
results. They reflect our continued growth across markets and the economy's steadily improving conditions. At
HTLF, we see growth everywhere. In this quarter, we saw growth in commercial loans, consumer loans, deposits
and fees, resulting in record earnings per share and net income.
In the second quarter, we delivered a record $1.41 earnings per share, an increase of $0.21 from the linked
quarter and $0.59 or 72%, from a year ago. Total assets grew to a record $18.4 billion, an increase of $127
million from the linked quarter. Assets are up $3.3 billion or 22% from a year ago.
Pre-provision net revenue was a record $72.8 million, a 5% increase from the linked quarter and an 11% increase
from a year ago. And our strong results delivered another record quarterly net income available to common
shareholders of $60 million, a 17% increase from the linked quarter and a 98% increase from a year ago.
Let's start with organic loan growth. Loans grew $288 million across our portfolios, excluding PPP, an increase of
over 3% from the linked quarter and a 13% annualized. The $288 million of growth significantly exceeded our
guidance for the quarter of $120 million. We saw strength in each of our commercial loan portfolios. From the
linked quarter, commercial and industrial increased $97.6 million, or 4%. Owner-occupied real estate increased
$102.6 million, or 5.6%. Non-owner-occupied real estate increased $20.2 million, or 1%. Construction increased
$58.3 million, or 7.3%, and our ag portfolio was flat.
We added nearly 170 new commercial relationships in the quarter, representing $90 million in loan growth. Our
bankers are leveraging the expertise of our growing HTLF Specialized Industries team. I want to congratulate our
top performing banks: DVNT in Iowa, FirstBank in Texas, Arizona Bank & Trust in Arizona, Citywide in Colorado,
and Premier Valley Bank in California. Our commercial pipeline remains strong. We're forecasting $200 million in
commercial loan growth in the third quarter. I've been meeting with clients and bankers, and we share a cautious
yet optimistic outlook. Some headwinds remain, namely: the impact of the Delta and other COVID variants,
lingering supply chain challenges, workforce shortages, wage pressures, and inflation.
We're working closely with our customers on the forgiveness process for PPP1 and PPP2 programs. Currently,
over 90% of our PPP1 loans have been forgiven or are in the process of being forgiven. Many borrowers who
participated in PPP2 are now eligible to file for forgiveness. Bryan will provide more PPP financial details during
his comments.
Growth in our core consumer-based loan portfolios, which encompass both commercial and residential mortgage
loans, was strong, increasing by $49 million for the linked quarter. 12% of these loans came from new customers,
and 13% of loans originated using our new online capabilities. The strong growth in our core consumer-based
portfolios was partially offset by the continued runoff in our non-core legacy National Residential Mortgage
portfolio, which we retained when we exited that business in 2018. Overall, core and non-core net growth for
consumer and residential mortgage loans totaled $13 million. We expect continued strong performance and
forecast $20 million of growth in core consumer-based loans in the third quarter.
Turning to deposits, non-time deposits totaled $14.5 billion, an increase of $133.3 million, or 1%, during the
quarter. We saw total deposit growth for the ninth consecutive quarter. Total deposits were a record $15.6 billion,
an increase of $56.1 million from the linked quarter and $2.9 billion, or 23%, from a year ago. The growth this
quarter was primarily from commercial customers.
We've maintained our exceptional deposit mix. 40% of deposits are in non-interest-bearing accounts and 93% in
non-time account balances. Total deposit costs remain low at 10 basis points, a decrease of 10 basis points from

a year ago. Our efficiency ratio increased slightly to 57.1%. We are laser focused on efficiency ratio and investing
to support our growth, while gaining efficiencies due to technology improvements and achieving scale.
We reduced FTEs by 40 during the second quarter. We are deeply invested in recruiting and retaining top-tier
talent in each of our markets. Since the beginning of 2021, we have continued to execute our multiyear talent
strategy and have installed four new bank presidents and four new heads of commercial banking. Our investment
in talent also includes growing our specialized industry group and adding more than 30 experienced commercial
bankers across our 11 banks. We have considerable momentum in talent acquisition and energy across our
organization.
Turning to credit metrics, I am pleased to report that we continue to see stable and improving credit quality on our
already strong results. Nonperforming loans decreased to 85 basis points of total loans compared to 91 basis
points in the linked quarter. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets also decreased to 50 basis
points from 54 basis points in the linked quarter.
Our delinquency ratio remains low at 17 basis points. Non-past rated loans decreased to 10.4%, a decrease of
1.1% for the quarter. And lastly, net loan charge-offs for the quarter were $3 million or 12 basis points of average
loans. Our growth and solid credit metrics are enabled by our unique model. Our bankers deeply understand our
local markets and have strong relationships with customers.
This insight helps guide our strategies and investments. We are on track to deliver more service enhancements in
digital functionality that will enrich the customer experience. We'll be extending our video banking capabilities
beyond our consumer customers to our wealth customers and commercial customers who use treasury
management. We're expanding our document management capabilities to help reduce administrative burden for
our customers and bankers.
We're adding more convenience features like online appointment scheduling and live chat. We'll offer P2P
payments using Zelle. We are partnering with Temenos for robust online account opening, loan origination, and
digital onboarding. And we're excited about offering custom digital experiences in the future through our customer
portal that's currently in development.
Based on changes in customer behavior, including increased adoption of digital channels, we'll continue to
optimize our branch network. We expect a further reduction in the branch network of 10%. Our investments in
integrated payments technology have been well received as customers move away from check payments and
achieve improved cash flow and greater efficiencies.
We are proud to be recognized for the sixth consecutive year by Nielsen report for top performance in commercial
purchase card programs. While the purchasing fleet and corporate card industry was down overall for Visa and
MasterCard last year, HTLF saw a 21% increase on our purchasing card, the fourth highest increase out of the
top 50 card issuers.
HTLF's mission is to enrich lives, one customer, employee and community at a time. In alignment, we are proud
to invest in our communities and be a socially responsible corporate citizen. A few investments we've made
include financing the development of low-income housing, the rehabilitation of historic buildings, and we've also
invested in solar energy.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
We named Wendy Reynolds, HTLF's first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. This new senior position
reinforces our company's values and will lead our DEI efforts with the support from me, my executive leadership
team and our Employee Diversity Advisory Council.
In early July, we welcomed all HTLF employees back to the office, many choosing hybrid schedules. There's an
energy to serve our customers and communities that we are experiencing in person again.
I am proud of how we've embraced change over the past 16 months. We've been agile, we've anticipated and
we've responded quickly, creatively and decisively. We continue to be well positioned to benefit from increasing
economic strength. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to deliver strength, insight and
growth to our customers, communities and shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing our earnings release, which outlines our strong
quarterly results with earnings per share reported at $1.41, $288 million of non-PPP loan growth, improved credit
metrics, and continued deposit growth.
But before I go into my detailed comments, I'll like to remind you that you can find additional information on the
quarter in the second quarter investor presentation, which is available in the IR section of our website.
So I'll start my comments today with the provision for credit losses which totaled a $7.1 million benefit this quarter,
primarily driven by an improved economic outlook and included the following favorable trends.
First, as we've already noted, total loan balances grew $288 million, ex-PPP.
Second, I believe this is the first quarter since early 2019 that loan upgrades exceeded downgrades and, at the
same time, nonperforming loans declined $6.5 million or 7%.
Third, consensus economic forecasts have improved the past two quarters. As a result, the economic outlook
factors used to develop the allowance were upgraded to incorporate a portion of the forecasted economic
improvement. But the factors still retain a measure of caution and uncertainty that management deems
appropriate for lingering economic headwinds that are yet to be resolved.
And last, net charge-offs were manageable this quarter at just under $3 million or 12 basis points of total loans.
These charge-offs were on loans that had previously been identified and had established reserves and, therefore,
had minimal effect on the quarter's provision.
So at quarter-end, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for
credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments, stood at $134.7 million or 1.35% of total loans. When the PPP
loan balances are excluded, the total allowance stands at 1.47%. In addition, at quarter-end, unamortized
purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled $16.7 million or 16 basis points of total loans, excluding
PPP.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
Moving to the rest of the balance sheet, investments grew $176 million this quarter and comprise just over 37% of
assets with a tax-equivalent yield of 2.27%, duration under 6 years, and generate about $70 million of monthly
cash flow.
Borrowings decreased $66 million to end the quarter at $424 million or 2.3% of assets. The tangible common
equity ratio increased 54 basis points to 8.08% at the quarter end. The TCE ratio rose 25 basis points due to the
increase in market value of investments and gained 29 basis points from retained earnings net of balance sheet
growth this quarter. HTLF's regulatory capital ratios also remained strong with common equity Tier 1 at just under
11.5% and total risk based at just over 15%. So the balance sheet continues to be very strong and well
positioned.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $141.2 million this quarter which was $1.6 million
higher than the prior quarter. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was 3.41%. That's
down 7 basis points compared to last quarter. During the quarter, investment yields declined 1 basis point and
loan yields declined 13 basis points. These are offset by a 4 basis point drop in interest costs. The margin was
positively impacted by a $900,000 increase in PPP fees recognized primarily due to a full quarter of PPP 2 loan
amortization and increased the net interest margin by 2 basis points over last quarter.
We exited the quarter with just over $23 million of unamortized PPP loan fees remaining on our books. Also this
quarter, the net interest margin includes 9 basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was down 3 basis
points from the prior quarter. Noninterest income totaled $33.2 million for the quarter, that's up $2.8 million from
last quarter. Total mortgage banking revenue was down $3.1 million but largely offset by security gains, which
increased $3 million compared to last quarter. In addition, service charges were $1.5 million higher and trust fees
were up $300,000 representing an 11% and 5% increase, respectively compared to last quarter.
Shifting to non-interest expense. Noninterest expenses totaled $103.4 million this quarter up $1 million from last
quarter. Excluding acquisition, integration, restructuring, and tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, our core
expenses increased $2.3 million to $101.6 million compared to $99.3 million last quarter. The increase was
primarily attributable to professional fees where automation and other digital technology project costs were higher.
On the positive side both employee and facility-related expenses were lower as FTEs declined by 40 and the
remaining cost saves from our AIM integration were realized. So, as we look ahead to the second half of 2021
and start to develop some views about 2022, we believe HTLF will continue to deliver strong results, highlighted
by strong loan pipelines, leading to an expected loan growth rate ex-PPP in the 1.5% to 2% range per quarter
going forward as the economy continues to strengthen. Remaining round one PPP forgiveness will happen largely
over the next one or two quarters and PPP two forgiveness will occur mainly over the next two or three quarters.
We anticipate that PPP reductions will be replaced by non-PPP loan growth and some bridge investments. And
as a result modest growth in earning assets is expected going forward.
Non-time deposit growth is likely to slow and could even show some slight run off in the back half of the year with
moderate to low – low to moderate growth expected in 2022. The net interest margin will continue to be
pressured, however net interest income excluding PPP fees is projected to grow 1.5% to 2% per quarter going
forward as earning assets grow and our mix improves. Provisions for credit losses are expected to remain low
and could be negative again in the next quarter or two and then return to more normal levels as loan growth
continues and the economy stabilizes in 2022.
Non-interest income excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to increase modest modestly over
the next two quarters from the $30.4 million this quarter. Core expenses are expected to remain flat in the $101

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
million to $102 million range per quarter in the back half of 2021 as professional fees are projected to remain at
current levels as we continue to invest in and complete projects and initiatives. We believe a 22% tax rate is a
reasonable full-year run rate assuming we get no tax law changes. And lastly, we expect the TCE ratio to climb
back above 8.5% by year-end as we get about 25 basis points increase from retained earnings per quarter.
However, a return to higher interest rates would weigh negatively on the ratio.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

Hi, Jeff.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
On the loan growth front kind of more than doubled your expectations. Just wanted to kind of see what happened
in the quarter? Is it payoff subsided, new demand, a bit of timing? And then, so that's kind of part one. And then
part two just if you could color that with any geographies that were particularly productive and/or kind of within
segment? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Jeff. I think that we did in our minds kind of overachieve what our forecast was but it really was the
culmination of our pipeline and a lot of those new relationships which I referenced, about 170 new relationships.
That's been a focus going forward. And we're just very fortunate as we won new business and won market share
almost across the board in all of our markets and we were able to get those loans closed during the quarter. But
with that, we have a very strong and almost equal pipeline to what we had going into the second quarter. Some
areas where we saw that growth that was in core manufacturing, healthcare, distribution were key areas. And we
8


Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
saw the growth really both in the Midwest and in the West. We especially had solid growth in Colorado, Arizona,
California, Texas and in the Midwest, really the Dubuque in Iowa kind of led that group. So, it was very kind of
consistent across all of our markets. And as I went through the various portfolios, we had solid growth really
across the board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And maybe I'll circle back to Bryan. On the expense line, you talked about professional services
staying perhaps elevated. You talked about kind of the expenses flat to $101 million or $102 million. What's the
difference there? Did you have some one-time in the expense that we should back out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think obviously projects and consultants are in there. So, as we do projects some of that moves
around but I think that that line was higher than when I'd given guidance last quarter. Part of that is we did think
about upping our timing of some of our projects moving things forward given that we had the fee income benefit
that was going to come from PPP 2. So, it'll be a little bit higher than I thought for the last half of the year. We're
still working on what it's going to be for next year but we will continue to fund projects that we think have good
paybacks and work on digital technology and tools and applications. So maybe a little bit down next year than
what we spent this year but we're going to continue to invest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Jeff. This is Bruce. I would just say and I mentioned several of the investments that are ongoing for us. We
made a conscious decision to accelerate some investments that we had planned on in 2022 into 2021, and that's
why we're seeing those elevated expenses. But I would say they're all around customer experience and improving
how the customers interface with us from a digital perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And sorry, I just have one last one on the M&A front. And you guys have been pretty active on the M&A
discussions, and I think you've really signaled California was – there was quite a few conversations there.
Obviously, we've seen some deals. Just wanted to kind of check back in and see any territories in particular that
you're eyeballing or seem to have some momentum?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, this Lynn Fuller. We're seeing a lot of activity. Some of the activity we're just simply passing on
because it's too small or it's not a good fit. And we've lost a couple deals because where our stock is trading for a
larger transaction, it's a little difficult to make those work and still stay committed to our financial performance
metrics.
But we're still looking at deals in Colorado, Denver area, and Arizona and the Phoenix area, Kansas – and in the
Kansas City area, Texas, West Texas specifically, and California; and we'll be making a number of calls this week
in California. And last week I was in Montana. So there's no shortage of opportunities. It's just a matter of finding
the right ones and kind of sorting through them.

Hey, Terry.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Bryan, thanks for all the financial outlook. That's always very helpful. Maybe I'll start, the rollout of HTLF, was it in
April? We talked about it last quarter. I'm just curious, three months into that, what's been the early feedback?
And are you hearing what you were expecting and has it been effective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Terry, this is Bruce. It's met our expectations, I guess, is how we would say it. We think that HTLF is more
contemporary. It's easier for some of our customers to understand. And every one of our markets uses the kind of
financial strength of HTLF a little differently. And some of our tag lines are Rocky Mountain Bank powered by
HTLF to try to explain a little better than we have historically the $18 billion of resources and assets behind each
one of our member banks. And I think that we're starting to see that in a positive way as we've gone upmarket
and attracted new customers from a commercial loan standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. And maybe ask a question on slide 13, which is the HTLF digital strategy. Somebody put a
meaningful amount of time into that slide. Bruce, what's the key takeaway from that slide? And then, from an
expense standpoint, there's still a lot of work in progress icons there. Where are you and, maybe using the
baseball analogy, what inning are you in it in terms of the expense side to then kind of checking all those boxes
off, so to speak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I'm going to let Bryan take the kind of what inning we're in. But I think that the big takeaway here is that we
are focused on the customer and the customer changes or their behavior, and we're trying to get out in front of
10


Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
(HTLF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2021
what the customer expectations are. Clearly, our industry is being disrupted on many, many fronts, and we want
to become one of those disruptors and make it easier for all of our customers to do business with.
As I mentioned when I was talking about the consumer loan growth, I think it was 13% of all the loans that we
originated were done online. A year ago, we didn't have that opportunity for us. So those investments are
beginning to pay off for us. And that's what's enabling us to prune our branches as well as attract a different type
of commercial customer than we ever have in the past.
So, Bryan, from an inning perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say we're probably in the middle innings here. I think we've got lots of things that you can see that
are under flight that we're working on, a few we've got ticked off. I think the ones just generally on the top part of
that page are the ones that we're excited about. Those are going to really help our growth in our account
acquisition.
So some more to go, which is why I think I probably – and when we talked last quarter, probably didn't have this
factored in correctly and why our expenses are up a little bit. And some of these will go into next year as well. So,
they're not short, just quick hit projects. These are bigger projects that have – that take a little bit of time. We're
excited about them, and I think we're really committed to them and really enhance our capabilities.

And, Terry, I think Bryan said it right. The top half, those two are really, again, customer-facing. The bottom half is
much more about infrastructure necessary to support the top half. And one of the reasons those consulting
expenses went up is internally based upon what we already had in flight, we were pretty much at capacity. We
wanted to accelerate these, so we had to bring in outside resources to help accelerate them.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So you've covered most of my questions. Just one on the utilization rate on page – or slide 27. Obviously, trailing
five quarters have been depressed just given the environment. But where can that eventually get back to, and any
sort of timing on what you expect it could return to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Was it line utilization? Is that your question, Andrew?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, the 28% in the second quarter, I mean, the trailing five quarters only goes back to 30%. But that's kind of
early on in the pandemic. So I guess what would it have been before the pandemic hit, and any expectation on
your timing on when it could get back there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I think we would have been in the mid to upper 30s, if you would go back and look at, say, the end of 2019.
And honestly, Andrew, this has been one of the things that we've been, I guess, wrong on in the last couple of
quarters, because we thought that commercial balances in particular would not necessarily continue to grow. We
would start to see some additional utilization, but that's just not the case right now. So, I don't know that we can
give you good guidance on when it's going to start going up. We do think that we've sort of hit bottom, but we
don't think it'll continue to trend downward.

Damon DelMonte Q

Great. Most of my questions have been answered, but just kind of curious on the outlook here for the reserve
level going forward. I think, Bryan, you had mentioned that it could be potentially negative or very low for the

upcoming quarters. I think you're at 1.47% right now, 1.47% right now. What's a comfort level for you guys? How
far down would you let that go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Well, I guess, I would answer that. If you kind of look – and I don't know what page it is in our deck...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'll get the page, Bryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...but if you look back, when we implemented CECL, day one, we were at about 115 basis points, and that was,
as you might recall, under really good economic circumstances, we hadn't kind of hit COVID. COVID was still only
in Japan really or China. We hadn't really had any big impact here. Then if you look at the next quarter, it was
coming in. Yeah, it's on page...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
34.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...34. And if you look at the first quarter, when we started to have – give impact to that, the COVID, and the
economy was starting to have some worries, that bumped up to really 135 basis points. Bruce and I and Nathan –
and Nathan you can jump in – I think we're thinking somewhere in the range of ex-PPP, we should be in the 130
to 125-ish range under pretty decent economic conditions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. That's helpful. That's good color. And then just one other kind of question here, I think, Bruce, you
may have mentioned about a longer-term reduction in branches of around 10% over time. Was that like a hard
and fast decision you guys have made already, or is that something you're just saying in general, given the usage
trends of customers, you could see yourselves reducing branches by another 10%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'll answer it two ways. We definitely feel that we will be reducing by 10%. We do have a process that's ongoing,
and we expect to have it completed here in the third quarter on sort of specifically how many, and we should be
able to provide you guidance at the end of the third quarter on exactly how many and when.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. That's all that I had. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
