For the next few minutes, I'll discuss our highlights for the fourth quarter and the year. I'll then turn the call over to
Kevin Thompson, our new CFO, for more on our results. Also joining us today is Nathan Jones, Chief Credit
Officer, who can answer questions regarding the stable credit quality across our portfolios.
Bryan McKeag, our retiring CFO, is also on the call. I want to personally thank Bryan for his numerous
contributions to HTLF over the past decade. His expertise and stewardship have helped guide our significant
growth during his tenure, and we wish him well during his retirement.
The HTLF board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the company's
common stock payable on February 27, 2024. The board also approved a dividend of $175 for Series E Preferred
Stock, which results in a dividend of $0.4375 per depositary share payable on April 15, 2024.
For more than 40 years, HTLF has increased or maintained our common stock dividend every quarter. This
reflects our strength, stability, and confidence in our strategies and performance. Stockholders also benefited
from a significant increase in tangible book value per common share, ending the year at $28.77, a 19% increase
from 2022.
2023 was a year of significant progress and successful execution of our strategic plans. We completed charter
consolidation, strategically and structurally positioning the company to focus on our next phase, HTLF 3.0, our
connected set of initiatives that will drive efficiency, enhance EPS growth, deliver higher return on assets, and
more efficient use of capital.
One component of HTLF 3.0 was repositioning our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, HTLF sold investment
securities, with proceeds totaling $865 million and a pre-tax loss of $140 million. The proceeds of the sale were
used to repay high-cost wholesale deposits and short-term borrowings.
By selling low-yielding investments and reducing high-cost wholesale funding, we increased our net interest
margin, improved our balance sheet efficiency and flexibility, and significantly strengthened our capital position.
This in part resulted in a $72.4 million loss for the quarter to common stockholders and EPS of negative $1.69.
For the year, net income available to common stockholders was $71.9 million and EPS of $1.68.
Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $45.6 million available to common stockholders and EPS of $1.06, which
excludes losses related to the balance sheet repositioning, losses on sale or write-down of assets, FDIC special
assessment expense, and restructuring costs. Adjusted earnings for the year were $193.9 million available to
common stockholders and EPS of $4.53.
We're already seeing benefits from our balance sheet repositioning. In the fourth quarter, net interest income was
$156 million, an increase of $10 million, or 7%, from the linked quarter. For the year, net interest income was
$601 million, an increase of $3 million, or 1%, from the previous year.
We saw a notable expansion of our net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, rising 34 basis points from the
linked quarter to 3.52%. And total assets were $19.4 billion, a decrease of $718 million, or 4%, from the linked
quarter. The decrease was largely due to the securities sold to repay wholesale funding and short-term
borrowings. HTLF maintained strong momentum in commercial loans and we continue to see growth in customer
deposits.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2024
Let's start with loan growth highlights. In the fourth quarter, we saw strength in our commercial and ag portfolios.
In total, commercial and ag loans grew $224 million, or 2%, from the linked quarter, in line with our guidance. For
the year, commercial and ag loans grew $719 million or 7%.
In the fourth quarter, we added 234 new commercial relationships, representing $196 million in funded loans and
$54 million of new deposits. Our commercial pipeline remains strong at over $1 billion. It's distributed across our
regions with strength in the Mountain West and Southwest.
While we added more than 2,200 consumer relationships in the quarter, our consumer loan portfolio decreased
$12 million, or 2%, from the linked quarter and residential mortgage loans decreased $16 million, or 2%. For the
year, consumer loans decreased $14 million, or 3%; residential mortgage loans decreased $56 million, or 7%.
Turning to deposits, wholesale deposits decreased $958 million from the linked quarter as the proceeds from the
balance sheet repositioning were used to pay down high-cost wholesale funding. Our deposit base continues to
be diverse and granular. Customer deposits are diversified by geography and industry, with no industry
concentration higher than 10% across our portfolios.
Customer deposits increased $59 million from the linked quarter, the second consecutive quarter of customer
deposit growth. Average customer deposits were up substantially from the linked quarter, increasing $271 million,
or 2%. While we maintain a favorable deposit mix, customer demand accounts decreased to 30% of customer
balances, reflecting the ongoing transition to interest-bearing accounts.
Total deposits for the quarter decreased to $16.2 billion, largely due to the pay down of wholesale deposits. 61%
of total balances are insured or collateralized. Total deposits for the year decreased $1.3 billion, with customer
deposits declining only $367 million, or 2%. Importantly, we saw momentum in the second half of the year, with
customer deposits increasing $295 million combined in the third and fourth quarters for 4% annualized growth.
Turning to key credit metrics, our disciplined approach continues to enable strong credit performance.
Delinquency ratio increased – decreased, I'm sorry, to 9 basis points of total loans and our lowest ratio of 2023.
Net charge-offs declined to $392,000 or 1 basis point of total average loans.
Non-performing assets increased to 57 basis points, primarily driven by the downgrade of a well-collateralized,
long-term Midwest manufacturing customer who is experiencing cash flow challenges due to a recent acquisition.
NPAs have already improved in the first quarter of 2024, with the sale of a real estate-owned property decreasing
the amount by $10 million with no additional loss associated.
Market conditions continue applying additional pressure on commercial real estate across the country, in the
office market specifically. Our office exposure is low at 3.2% of our total loan portfolio. We're conducting targeted
reviews of our portfolios where we see stress or additional potential weakness. We continue to enhance our
ongoing portfolio management and surveillance and refine how we screen new opportunities for underwriting.
In 2023, HTLF continued executing our strategies despite industry challenges. We completed charter
consolidation and introduced HTLF 3.0, the next phase of our strategic plan, which includes repositioning the
balance sheet, reducing our retail delivery costs by centralizing our retail structure, decreasing the number of
retail leaders and increasing their span of control, and reducing real estate expenses through branch
rationalization, size, and location.

Our current footprint is also under review as we look to maximize our return on capital. We're investing in growth
by expanding middle market banking and adding talent in California's Central Valley, Denver, Kansas City,
Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Phoenix; expanding Treasury Management products and capabilities and creating a
digital platform to serve consumers and small business.
Each of these components are underway and at various stages, but all will help us better serve our customers
and drive efficiency, enhance EPS growth, deliver a higher return on assets, and more efficient use of capital. [ph]
For more (14:39) on HTLF 3.0, please refer to pages 5 through 12 in the investor deck.
HTLF is moving forward together in 2024. We're executing our 3.0 strategies, investing in quality revenue growth,
reducing our operating costs, improving EPS growth, return on assets and efficient use of capital, and most
importantly, serving our customers and communities. This is all due to the hard work and dedication of HTLF's
employees. I want to recognize and thank them for their continued commitment to delivering strength, insight, and
growth to our customers, communities, investors, and each other.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Thompson, Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and
financials.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Bruce. I first want to say how thrilled I am to be part of the HTLF team. I've long admired HTLF from
positions in peer banks and I'm very excited to be part of a talented team that's just in the beginning of the HTLF
3.0 strategic transformation. The unusual items in the quarter that Bruce described are detailed in our earnings
release and on page 13 of our earnings presentation. Most of these items are related to actions that will improve
the profitability of the bank going forward.
We had a pre-tax loss of $140 million related to a sale of securities. The proceeds from this repositioning were
used to pay down high-cost wholesale deposits and borrowings. This both improves our liquidity profile and will
result in approximately $6 million in improved net interest income per quarter going forward.
We had $4.4 million of restructuring expenses, $2.1 million related to sales and valuations of facilities, and $1.3
million of expenses as we consolidated our final bank charter in the quarter. We executed on projects to centralize
our retail management and to consolidate our footprint. These are just the beginning of the plans under HTLF 3.0
to increase our operational leverage, optimize our efficiency, and to serve our customers more effectively. Refer
to our earnings deck for more details on our strategic transformation.
Finally, we had an FDIC insurance special assessment as many banks did this quarter of $8.1 million. We
continue to see good economic trends in our business. Loan growth totaled $196 million and customer deposits
grew $59 million, with average customer deposits increasing $271 million compared to the prior quarter. Loans to
deposits increased to 74% as we decreased our wholesale deposits.
Investments decreased $832 million due to bond sales of $865 million and normal amortization offset by
improvements in fair value with the decline in interest rates. We are very pleased that our revenue growth
exceeded analyst and even our own expectations in the quarter. Net revenues increased 6% or $10 million when
adjusting for the securities loss. This is driven mostly by our expanding net interest margin, which increased to
3.52%.

Loan yields increased 28 basis points to 6.49% while interest-bearing liabilities only increased 10 basis points to
3.11%. The total cost of deposits decreased 1 basis point to 2.09%.
Non-interest expense was up in the quarter and adjusting for the $15 million of unusual items, expenses were up
$4.8 million. Professional fees were higher than usual, and we expect them to normalize going forward. Also, we
made additional investments in tax credit projects, which are offset with benefits in tax expense. These two items
account for $6 million of additional expenses in the quarter and excluding them, expenses would've been down
around $1 million. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 59% for both the quarter and full year.
Non-interest income, when adjusting for securities losses, was flat to the prior quarter. This included a decrease
of $600,000 in consumer NSF and overdraft fees in the month of December as we instituted new fee policies
across our single charter customer base. This is a permanent change to our consumer fee structure that will
impact our fee income going forward, but we expect to offset this with growth in Treasury Management, card fees,
and other strategic fee initiatives.
The provision for loan losses was $11.7 million in the quarter, with an allowance for lending-related credit losses
of 1.15% of total loans. The provision was driven by loan growth and one credit that moved to non-accrual status
that required a specific reserve. Net loan charge-offs remain low at 1 basis point for the quarter and 11 basis
points for the full year, and delinquencies were also low at 9 basis points to total loans.
Capital ratios are strong with the CET1 ratio of 11% even after the securities loss and other restructuring
expenses that will improve our profitability going forward. The tangible common equity ratio increased 80 basis
points to 6.53%, which benefited from the increase in market value of our investments and the reduction in assets
as part of our balance sheet repositioning.
If you refer to page 28 of our earnings deck, we provide our management outlook for 2024 compared to our 2023
results, assuming no change in the economic environment. We expect loan growth of 6% to 8%, principally in our
commercial portfolio in the year. We anticipate a 5% to 7% increase in deposits to fund loan growth with strong
commercial and some consumer growth. We plan to let our securities portfolio amortize down with the cash flows
used to pay off wholesale funding.
We expect a stable net interest margin of around 3.5%, assuming a stable interest rate environment. We expect
our full year provision for credit losses to increase modestly. We expect core non-interest income to be flat, with
growth in Treasury Management and card fees, offset by lower consumer and small business NSF and overdraft
fees, as well as lower mortgage fees with our exit of the mortgage business in 2023.
Core expenses should be down around 2% with lower occupancy, marketing, legal, and operational expenses,
offset by performance compensation and technology investments. Our effective tax rate should be around 24%
excluding discrete items, such as new tax credits. And finally, earnings accretion and securities amortization are
expected to increase all capital ratios, with CET1 approaching 11.5% to 12% by year-end.
I will now turn the time back over to Bruce.

Thanks, Kevin. 2023 was a year of significant progress and successful execution of our strategic plans. We

HTLF 3.0. We've repositioned the balance sheet, centralized our retail structure, and increased retail leadership's
span of control.
We're reviewing our current footprint to maximize return on capital, reducing real estate expenses through branch
rationalization, size, and location; investing in middle market banking and adding talent in key growth markets;
expanding Treasury Management products and capabilities; and creating a digital platform to serve consumers
and small business customers. We remain focused on continuing to achieve organic growth while reducing
expenses, enhancing EPS growth, delivering a higher return on assets, and efficiently using our capital.
So I think now we can turn it over to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis of D.A.
Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple questions, I guess, on the outlook. The first, on the margin. Stable here, I guess
in line with kind of Q4. I wanted to kind of check in on sensitivity with rate cuts in the second half if there were to
be some. Generally speaking, well, first question is surprised maybe no tail of benefit from the restructuring.
Maybe that's chewed up by deposit costs in the first part of the year. But then if you could just kind of position us
for where the balance sheet is should you see some rate cuts in the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'll respond that It really depends on how the yield curve plays out this year. We're inverted now. We do hope that
the yield curve normalizes over time and that really will impact banks across the country.
I'll say that we are asset-sensitive, so on a raw basis unadjusted, any 25 basis points decreased rates impacts us
about 5 to 7 basis points in our NIM. That's on a raw basis. We do have the opportunity to react and strategically
create some opportunities to buoy that up among many other things that we're talking about right now. We can
put some hedging floors in place with our loans. We have some opportunities to reposition some of our wholesale
funding. We have a lot of deposit programs going on that should benefit us, and that we have some hedges in
place that make us more asset-sensitive. But those roll off over time and so this is the topic of the year obviously
and we are all over it and have some strategic initiatives right now to be able to be prepared for a rate down
scenario.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2024
Jeff, this is Bruce. I might add a couple of things. It's really very dependent upon what the deposit betas are and if
we're able to overachieve what we've modeled, that helps the margin. Also, if as we expect we're able to grow
deposits to fund loan and use the cash flow of the investment portfolio to repay wholesale funding, I mean, that in
essence shrinks our balance sheet, but that is an accretive trade to our margin and to our revenue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So it really depends on our ability to execute on those couple of things on whether or not we'll be able to improve
on the decrease in margin that Kevin discussed with a each quarter percent move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you for that. And a quick one on the expense guide. What would you put the base of the core
expense in 2023 to kind of base off of the down 2%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the easiest way to look at it is the fourth quarter. So expenses came in at about $130 million. You take out
$15 million of those unusual items and then I also called out another $6 million of run rate that was higher than
normal. So that puts you about $109 million, $110 million quarterly. That seems like our run rate going forward.
And that includes merit increases, performance increases. So underlying, there are a lot of benefits we're seeing
from the initiatives we've been doing over the past few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Kevin, if I take that $109 million, $110 million again and then you're going to hope to improve expenses by 2%
over the course of the year off that quarterly run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I should be a little more clear. That would be our run rate, $109 million to $110 million quarter on average.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. For the balance of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's right.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Okay. One last one, if I could. Wanted to kind of, Bruce, you've laid out a pretty good plan here with 3.0.
First question would be kind of the timeline to that. I haven't had a chance to look through all the slides of the – I
guess in 2024, the tangible, what do you think you'll complete this year?
And then second part of that question is, I guess if M&A were to present itself in terms of bankers or markets that
you've targeted that you want to grow into, not abandon the plan but you pivot and say, well, we can acquire this
for a cheaper – I guess clarifying that question, what part does M&A come up if it did and it were attractive and it
accelerated kind of what you're doing with 3.0 in terms some of the growth in talent acquisition?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. So let me maybe first talk about what we'll achieve in 2024 and beyond. If you
look on page 12 of the earnings deck, it kind of lays out what our targets are for three years and we would expect
to make progress in every single area during 2024, but it really starts to ramp-up in 2025 and 2026 because a lot
of the investments, particularly in people and in our Treasury Management investments are really being made in
2024.
So I think that's probably at the moment the best I can do but we would expect again to make progress. But the
significant progress happens in 2025 and 2026, and we feel very confident to be able to achieve these targets
over that period of time.
And if we look at M&A, so first, we're very far along in the talent acquisition in those specific markets. And we
would look at M&A if it was the right culture, provided the right accretion. They were focused as a commercial
bank and they were in market, particularly in those growth markets that I mentioned. So we're not opposed at all
to M&A and have ongoing dialogue with some institutions in those markets. But our focus right now is on talent
acquisition as opposed to M&A. But we would pivot if we needed to or if the opportunity presented itself.

Hey, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Kevin, welcome to the call and Bryan, best of luck to you in the future.
Maybe if I could start, when I was looking through slides 8 through 9, I just kept seeing dollar signs, just a
significant investment in a lot of important areas. So I guess my question is how are you paying for HTLF 3.0? Is it
all footprint and facilities optimization? And I guess how do you alleviate any concerns that there'll be some
expense creep as we move through 2024 and into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So maybe let's talk first about facilities for a moment. I think it's pretty obvious as we look at all of our
facilities and how we've grown over the years that our facilities are 20 to 30 years old. They're too large. They
were built at a time where branches were utilized by consumers and it's a whole different world. So this – we're
now going to attack our cost structure. We believe that not only the real estate, but also the people will all come
down. So I'm not really worried about account or expense creep because while we're doing it, we're also investing
in additional technology, particularly the digital bank for the consumers and small business. So we're really – we
feel very confident that our delivery system will actually decrease pretty significantly over this three-year period of
time. Did I answer that – your question there, Terry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Yes. And just as a follow-up, when you were – in your prepared remarks, when you say kind of take a look at
your footprint, do you mean individual locations within a region or a state or are you implying looking at a state or
something larger than just one branch? If my question makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Terry, in my comments, I was really talking about much more than a branch or potentially even a region.
We are really taking a deep dive into each of our markets and looking at the capital that we have invested, the
returns that we're getting, and where we look out a couple years to see whether or not the growth will be there in
those markets. So, we're taking a very heavy look at that, which, honestly, we've never really done in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson Q
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe just a quick question for Nathan. The increase in non-accrual or non-performing loans, it
was company-specific, not connected to any broader weakness in your manufacturing customer base. Is that a
fair statement?

Hi, Andrew.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hi. The provision, though, looks like with a company that
voluntarily is shutting down, is that tied to this manufacturing credit? Just kind of curious on the specifics around
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A

I'm going to let Nathan take that one, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I'll take that one, Andrew. No, that's a different company. It's one of the ones that we just decided to take a very
conservative posture. As you start to get into accounts receivable and a lot of the other areas, we're working
through that one. We decided to go ahead and just take a sort of posture, so we don't have to keep coming back.
We can just deal with it upfront, and then move through it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. All right. And then, the expense guidance here does not include any tax credit amortization. And I guess
you've had those now for several quarters, so it's kind of – we have to kind of forecast those out some way or
another. So, I guess what's your expectation on that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, you're right. The tax credits we've been doing recently are solar tax credits that are more short term in
nature and they do impact expenses, but they also benefit the tax line. And so, we don't currently anticipate any
for this year, but we will be opportunistic if anything interesting comes up.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2024
Got it. Okay. So it should be a pretty clean year for the tax rate and for the expense base, right?

That's what we expect at this point.

Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Hope everybody's doing well. Kevin, welcome and, Bryan, best of luck in your
new endeavors.
Just wanted to follow-up on the outlook for provision. I think you noted that it'd be up slightly over the 2023 year.
Does that include the elevated amount here in the fourth quarter or are you talking about if it was a normalized
level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That mostly includes loan growth and it does carry forward our current credit outlook in the credits that Nathan
mentioned earlier, which we think are well-controlled. But we are being conservative in case the economy softens
a little bit and we're providing a little bit for loan growth there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And the one credit that drove the provision higher, was that loan included in the NPL increase this quarter
as well?

Yes, it was. It was just a smaller piece of it and, honestly, if those two loans weren't there, it would have been a
recovery. So the other one – the major driver was the other one that was a manufacturing company that was
primarily driving the increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then lastly, just on fee income, you kind of expect it to remain flattish but a little bit of pressure, I
think, you said on the service fee line kind of offset by growth in some other areas. Did I hear that correctly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
That's correct. Yeah, a little bit of pressure we already saw in the fourth quarter. And you saw we were flat still the
third quarter, so we've already started to overcome that in Treasury Management and some of the other HTLF 3.0
initiatives that we're working on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's all that I had. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of David Long of Raymond
James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I want to follow-up on the footprint review question. Maybe Terry was kind of going this route, but as you're
completing this footprint review, would one of your subsidiary banks, could that potentially be a sale candidate? Is
that something that we can go that far to mention or could you talk about that as an option?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that everything's on the table when we look at one of our subsidiaries. And again, we're very
focused on the capital that we have allocated, the growth of our subsidiaries as well as the expense structure of
those same subsidiaries.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2024
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And I'll just add as part of HTLF 3.0, part of that is bringing on talent and we brought on a really talented team to
help us understand the underlying economics of our business and really help us understand capital allocations
and funds transfer pricing, what is truly contributing to the profitability of this company going forward so that we
can really dynamically and strategically look at that and adapt to this interesting banking environment, I believe,
we'll see in the next several years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would also say, David, now that we have all of our charters consolidated and we're looking at everybody through
the same lens, it does have a different approach to things where before, when we had separate charters,
separate balance sheets, they may have a different investment portfolio with a different yield, which generates a
different answer. But now, as we've consolidated everything and we're looking at everybody on a consistent
basis, it comes up with different answers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. No, that's great color. Thanks, guys. And then the other question I had, I think, Kevin, you mentioned a $6
million in incremental NII from the sort of portfolio restructuring with the securities sale. When you say $6 million
incremental, is that on top of what you reported here in the fourth quarter? What is that $6 million incremental
based on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We benefited from some of that in the fourth quarter. The securities repositioning happened on November 14. So
we saw about half of that benefit, $3 million of that in the quarter. And so there are obviously a lot of puts and
takes in your net interest margin going forward. That's a benefit. There's still headwinds in the economy with
banks still experiencing higher deposit costs. Thank goodness we did not. We were flat this quarter, which is a
really good sign going forward. But a lot of good puts and takes going forward. We could do better than that on
net interest margin if the – again, the yield curve cooperates, but we're not sure how the federal reserve is going
to react. We're not sure what competition is going to look like. This is kind of unchartered territory that we're
making sure that we're prepared for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Excellent. That's great. Thanks for the clarity. And then just finally, the HTLF 3.0, are you expecting any non-core
expenses on top of that $109 million to $110 million run rate or do you think most of those have already been
included?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin L. Thompson A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Most of those are already included. There could be some as we're going through – we're just in the initial stages
of HTLF 3.0 and we're evolving as we go. So there could be areas where there are additional expenses, but there
would be, from our view, a very quick earn back of those expenses to buoy up our model.

You bet. That includes real estate, I'll add, if there's something in our footprint that needs adjustments.
