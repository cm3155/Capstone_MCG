Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to Western Alliance Bancorporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings
Call. You may also view the presentation today via webcast through the company's website at
www.westernalliancebancorporation.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Miles Pondelik, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Development.
Please go ahead.

Miles Pondelik
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Development, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you and welcome to Western Alliance Bank's First Quarter 2023 conference call. Our speakers today are
Ken Vecchione, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dale Gibbons, Chief Financial Officer; and Tim
Bruckner, Chief Credit Officer.
Before I hand the call over to Ken, please note that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements,
which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Except as required by law, the company does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. For a more complete discussion of the risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, please
refer to the company's SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed yesterday, which are available on the company's
website.
Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione.

Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Miles. I would like to start by thanking our clients for the trust they placed in Western Alliance and to
the people of Western Alliance for their extraordinary efforts over the last month. Since the collapse of three
competitor banks in mid-March, our team has worked relentlessly to meet our clients' banking needs.
Flexibility of our diversified, national commercial banking strategy, with a broad range of value-added deposit
channels and deep commercial customer relationships in a wide variety of sectors and geographies, all
contributed to our firm's resilience in the face of recent turbulence in the banking industry. We believe our focus
on sound financial fundamentals, stable asset quality and rebuilding capital and liquidity levels over the past
several quarters have all helped us navigate through this challenging time.
As we move forward with a renewed perspective, we are well positioned to expand our client relationships and
continue to achieve strong return profile. Balance sheet repositioning, which included surgical sales of assets and
loan reclassifications, resulted in after tax net non-operating charges of $110 million, but will have an immediate
accretive impact to regulatory capital and allow us to prioritize core client relationships with holistic lending,
deposit and treasury management needs.
The company earned through these charges and achieved net income of $142 million and earnings per share of
$1.28 for the quarter, increasing tangible book value per share 3.3% to $41.56 from year-end with a CET ratio of
9.4%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Immediately after the exogenous events of mid-March, WAL experienced elevated net deposit outflows that soon
returned to normalized levels. Outflows were concentrated on few key client groups that will form our funding
strategy going forward. Suffering from the taint of SVB's failure, approximately $3.3 billion or 43% of our
technology and innovation deposits were withdrawn, less than anticipated, given that 50% also had lending
relationships.
Our mortgage warehouse business remains fairly stable on a net basis, with only the loss of a single customer
that we expect to return to Western Alliance with more stable deposits. Although Settlement Services experienced
some initial volatility from very recently acquired clients, flows normalized quickly. Balances were stable quarter-
over-quarter. Our regional divisions, strong local brands and small to midsize metro business relationships acted
as a core source of strength and saw only modest deposit attrition. Non-core regions, which included title
companies and other fiduciaries, reacted more reflexively, stock market volatility and withdrew approximately $2.6
billion. These are non-deposit channels that we are prioritizing going forward.
Since March 20, our deposit flow stabilized and returned to a healthy growth trajectory with deposits up $2.9
billion to $49.6 billion as of April 14. Some business lines were never impacted, including HOA, with deposits
higher by $900 million since the beginning of the year to April 14.
Our flexible diversified business model proved its worth in Q1, while monoline banking models dependent on
single industries or concentrated customer types failed. 85% of our customers already have more than one
product or service with us and we will continue to prioritize client segments with fulsome banking service needs
that include credit and treasury management, while deemphasizing credit-only relationships.
Overall, WAL successfully retained deep rooted relationships and those for which we offer proprietary integrated
treasury management technology solutions, like HOA and we'll continue to do more of these. It is also worth
mentioning that not a single deposit channel of ours represented greater than 16% of total deposits at the onset of
the deposit crisis.
We responded to our clients' desire for the market scrutiny surrounding enhanced deposit protection. Since
yearend, we have taken concrete steps to dramatically grow our insured deposits from approximately 45% of total
deposits to 73% as of April 14. This places WAL on the top decile among the 50 largest US banks.
Also as of April 14, uninsured deposit coverage now stands at 158%. This resulted from the shift towards insured
deposits to accommodate depositors' desires to have their funds safe and protected. We will continue to provide
clients of deposit alternatives that accentuate safety in these uneasy times. I think it's important to offer some
thoughts on the volatility experienced in our industry since mid-March. While navigating through new
developments through strategies initiated in 2022 and initially described in our Q3 and Q4 earnings calls, such as
de-emphasizing loan growth in advance of an economic slowdown or in deposits and liquidity faster than loan
growth and achieving a greater than 10% CET1 ratio.
Informed by lessons learned and the recent stress of the banking system, we have moved up our medium-term
CET1 goal to 11% and we are targeting a mid-80s loan-to-deposit ratio. At the onset of this tumult, we acted
decisively to tap various sources to enhance our liquidity position, engaged with stakeholders through measured,
but impactful financial updates and maintain normal business operations.
Looking forward, we will remain focused on building additional liquidity and capital while reaffirming our deposit-
led growth strategy. Driving increased diversification and additional deposit streams are also our top strategic

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
goals. To ensure adequate liquidity over the medium term, we will aim to drive our loan-to-deposit ratio to the mid-
80s by cultivating deeper client relationships.
We look to organically and expeditiously rebuild capital greater than 10% before the end of the second quarter.
Our medium-term CET1 target is 11%. Emulating larger banks that typically have larger capital cushions will be
an important step to drive sustained core deposit growth and the regulatory environment will likely become stricter
in response to recent industry turmoil.
Higher capital, higher liquidity and lower dependence on moderate rate funding should attract more core deposits
and hopefully higher investment-grade ratings. Accelerating HQLA growth in securities book is also something
that we plan to do.
Bolster liquidity and capital. We chose to reposition our balance sheet through very targeted reclassification of
certain loans and assets from held-for-investment to held-for-sale and specific noncore asset sales. We
reclassified approximately $6 billion of HFI loans, recognizing an approximately 2% fair value adjustment of $92.2
million after tax that includes expected future P&L and capital impacts. After tax charge will be immediately
accretive to regulatory capital as the loans are liquidated and allows us to devote efforts to pull client relationships
with lending, deposit and treasury management needs.
We've already made significant progress in executing this strategy with actions that add 51 basis points to CET1.
Q1 $920 million of loan sales were executed in fourth quarter-end with another $3 billion already under contract,
but not closed by 3/31. MSR sales of $360 million, select security sales of $460 million, and the unwind of high-
cost mortgage warehouse equity fund resource CLNs, all contributed to help offset the HFI reclassification
onetime charge. In addition, we are moving expeditiously to execute the remaining $3 billion of HFS loan sales.
Loan sales realized more losses than we expected. Note the ones that are on the remaining HFS loans are
incorporated into our Q1 numbers.
These actions reaffirmed our plans to surpass 10% CET1 capital by June 30. Even with the mark-to-market
adjustments from balance sheet repositioning, we still advanced our CET1 ratio 6 basis points to 9.38%. When
considering the contracted loan sales for this month and the unwind of our EFR, CLN capital call and subscription
lines, we've already locked in CET1 ratio above 9.71% before considering our organic capital generation or
completing sales of the remainder of the HFS loans, which will ultimately push CET1 above 10%.
Finally, Western Alliance has significantly access to more than $21 billion in contingent sources of liquidity to
meet the customer and operating needs. Access to on-balance sheet cash and unused borrowing capacity
increases to greater than $26 billion with the near-term completion of HFS asset sales, $3 billion of which are
contractually agreed to and will be used to pay down higher cost BTFP and FHLB short-term borrowings and
return to a more normal sources of financing. We continue to evaluate additional opportunities to establish
secured borrowing facilities from other sources.
At this time, I'll let Dale take you through the financial results.

Thanks, Ken. Turning to the first quarter results. Western Alliance earned total adjusted net revenue of $712
million, excluding non-operating charges. Net income was $142 million, while adjusted net income was $252
million. Earnings per share was $1.28 with an adjusted EPS of $2.30. Quarterly loans decreased $5.4 billion as
$6 billion was transferred to HFS, matching the deposit decline of $6 billion.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Total adversely-graded assets increased $35 million and quarterly net charge-offs was $6 million or 5 basis points
annualized. Operating return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.43% and
21.9% provide sustainable go-forward earnings. In the quarter, Western Alliance generated preprovision net
revenue of $352 million. Total adjusted net revenue of $712 million was an increase of 28% year-over-year and
an increase of $1.9 million, fourth quarter. Net interest income decreased during the quarter to $610 million.
Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion, while lower yielding cash grew 5% and 2.1% of interest-earning
assets creating a drag on the new.
GAAP noninterest income decreased $120 million to a negative $58 million, while adjusted noninterest income
grew $31.7 million from the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenue increased $26 million quarterly to $73.3
million, as AmeriHome continues to see green shoots in this operating environment. Production margins have
widened to more historically normalized levels of 26 basis points as the industry capacity has been rationalized.
Retreat of a large money center bank from the correspondent lending market has paved the way for higher
margins and win rates. The servicing rights assets continue to produce attractive returns given the lower
prepayment fees and strong underlying asset quality and continued to attract interest from investors.
Q1 sale of $360 million of MSRs at par provide flexibility and a long glide path before we come to the market
again. Loans held for investment decreased $5.4 billion to $46.4 billion and deposits decreased $6 billion
[indiscernible] (00:13:33) to $47.6 billion at quarter-end. MSR balances decreased $238 million in the quarter to
$910 million. Total borrowings increased $9.6 billion over the prior quarter to $16.7 million due to an increase in
short-term borrowings of $9.8 billion, partially offset by redemptions of credit-linked notes $265 million. Finally,
tangible book value per share increased $1.31 or 3.3% over the prior quarter to $41.56, and up nearly 12% over
the prior year.
Turning now to the decomposition of our quarterly go-forward and go-forward net interest drivers. Our investment
securities portfolio grew approximately $600 million to $9.1 billion as we sold $460 million of securities,
predominantly credit CLOs. Other investments increased approximately $900 million, which primarily consists of
high-quality liquid assets such as treasury bills, part of our strategy to further enhance our liquidity position.
Investment yields increased 24 basis points from the third quarter to 4.69% with an end-of-quarter spot rate of
4.60%.
Given the uncertain economic environment, we curtailed loan growth early in the first quarter. This slowdown in
credit accelerated in March as we rightsized existing loan balances through reclassification, through held-for-sale
and targeted loan sales of approximately $7 billion, primarily from limited credit – relationship credits or with
limited credit spreads. These actions lowered our period-end balance to $46.4 billion. Loan yields continue to
benefit from repricing into the higher rate environment and wider overall spreads with an end-of-quarter spot rate
of 6.45% compared to an average rate of 6.28%. Our residential loan portfolio of $15 billion is match funded with
noninterest-bearing deposits of $16.5 billion.
Turning to a decomposition of our held-for-investment loan reclassification. Loans transferred to HFS, nearly half,
were syndicated credits in capital call and subscription lines, areas we had previously mentioned we would be
deemphasizing. $5.9 billion loans held-for-sale portfolio had a quarter-end spot yield of 7.34%, which are now
funded by FHLB borrowings with a current spot cost of 5.05, resulting in a modest 2.3% margin, completing the
sales transaction, lend support and buoyancy to our net interest margin guide.
Total cost of deposits spot rates increased 45 basis points to 1.85% at quarter end, compared to an average of
1.72%. This was primarily driven by a $1.5 billion increase in CDs that now comprise 14% of deposits, while non-

interest bearing DDAs comprise 35% of our total deposit mix, of which 52% have no cash payment of earnings
credits.
Notably, the spot rate for interest bearing DDA is lower than the average for the quarter as migration from non-
interest bearing checking is accomplished at lower rates than the average interest checking rate. But savings and
money market rates were also lower at – also were lower as balance attrition tended to be from larger and higher
cost accounts.
Cost of interest bearing deposits increased 78 basis points for the quarter to 2.75% compared to the ending spot
rate of 2.82%. $6 billion decline in deposits during the quarter was roughly evenly split between money market
accounts and demand deposits.
Overall, net interest income decreased $30 million or 4.7% over the prior quarter, nearly half due to two fewer
days in the quarter and the remainder due to balance sheet repositioning actions in light of the deposit loss. Held
for sale loans contributed $31 million, which will decline as we liquidated these assets. Net interest margin
compression compressed 19 basis points to 3.79% due to increased borrowings, short term excess cash on the
balance sheet we had to ensure liquidity and an incremental drag of 11 basis points. Going forward, we estimate
that our balance sheet is fairly interest rate neutral with rate shock sensitivity, either up or down, only changing
net interest income by less than 1%.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio increased to 43% from 39% in the quarter and was flat year-over-year. Higher
deposit cost of $5 million related to higher earnings credit rates and normal Q1 seasonality were the primary
drivers of the increase from the fourth quarter.
Pre-provision net revenue was $352 million during the quarter, a 15% increase from the same period last year
and a decrease of $25 million or 7% from the prior quarter. This resulted in PPNR return on assets of 2% for the
quarter, a decrease of 15 basis points from Q4. The aggregate of adversely graded credits increased $35 million
this quarter. We see nothing significant in this modest migration to indicate a more widespread deterioration is
looming.
Total non-performing assets increased $22 million, 17 basis points of total assets. [ph] Really (00:18:53) net loan
charge-offs was $6 million or 5 basis points of average loans, with the net loan charge-offs of $1.8 million or 1
basis points in the fourth quarter.
Our total loan ACL decreased $7 million from the prior quarter to $350 million as loans were marked down and
the ACL released as these credits were transferred to held for sale. Loan ACL to funded loans increased to 75
basis points compared to 69 basis points in Q4 as some of the loans transferred had low loss rate assumptions,
including capital call and subscription lines and mortgage warehouse credits. Additionally, the reserve associated
with commercial real estate will increase as the economic outlook softens.
Tangible common equity to total assets of 6.5% and common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.4% were both bolstered by
net income. Like the increase we expect for CET1 in the second quarter, the tangible common equity ratio should
rise in tandem.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.36 per share, our tangible book value per share increased
to $1.31 in the quarter to $41.56. Tangible book value per share continued its long ascent, as the earnings power
of the company surpassed charges associated with the bank's balance sheet repositioning. TBV also benefited
from a reduced AOCI impact after crimping book value last year as bond prices fell when rates rose.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Now, I'll turn the call back to Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Thanks, Dale.
Our guidance for the rest of 2023 continues to be driven by the strategies and priorities laid out in our Q3 and Q4
2022 earnings calls and informed by the recent banking disruptions. In order to best serve our sophisticated
commercial clients, we will continue to aim to be more aligned with the country's largest banks by rebuilding our
capital levels, enhancing insured deposits and liquidity, lowering our loan-to-deposit ratio, and deepening our
client relationships.
We want to be seen as equal to these banks – these peer banks from our depositors' perspective. Eliminating
these differences allows us to compete more on service, performance and, what I call, management intimacy. Our
C-suite relationships can drive deeper banking relationships, organic earnings, balance sheet repositioning. We'll
continue to grow capital as we reposition the company for slower growth ahead of a potential economic
slowdown.
So, let me tell you what this means going forward. Regarding capital, we discussed our imminent lift in CET1 to
9.7% and that we expect to exceed 10% by the end of Q2 through planned loan HFS sales and organic capital
growth. Over the medium term, we will target an 11% CET1 ratio, which will be driven by our continued strong
return on average tangible common equity and capital generation.
As we complete our planned HFS loan sales, we will pay off short-term borrowings and return to more traditional
bank funding. Deposits are expected to grow at approximately $2 billion a quarter and exceed more muted loan
growth. This will lower our loan-to-deposit ratio over time towards a mid-80% target.
Net interest margin is expected to slightly compress in 2023 to 3.65% to 3.75%, given the anticipated flat rate
environment, slower loan growth and increasing price competition for deposits. As our liquidity grows, we will look
to accelerate [ph] HQI (00:22:35) growth in our securities book to further enhance liquidity flexibility.
Our efficiency ratio, excluding the impact of deposit cost, should increase slightly to the mid to high-40s given our
smaller loan book, but partially offset by the inherent operating leverage of our business. Asset quality remains
well-positioned and steady as she goes. And then on future economic environment, net charge-offs could begin to
normalize and we expect net charge-offs to range between the first quarter's 5 basis points, maybe up to 15 basis
points.
Overall, we expect PPNR for the full year of 2023 to be down 5% to 10% from 2022 levels through small interest
earning assets and higher borrowing costs. However, as we execute our balance sheet repositioning efforts and
continue to reestablish our core deposit growth trajectory, we see Western Alliance as even a better institution
and better well-positioned for the future.
At this time, Dale, Tim and I are happy to take your questions.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos
with JPMorgan. Steven, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. I wanted to start with a big picture question first. So, just following up on the balance sheet
repositioning in the quarter, a fair portion of your growth over the past few years has come from these non-core
segments, right, which you're now exiting. With you shrinking the company down to focus more on core
relationships; one, when do you get there, right, when is the bank primarily done in terms of shrinking down to get
to these more fuller relationships? And then even more important, what does Western Alliance look like after that?
Do you focus on ROE, profitability, are you still a growth bank? What is Western Alliance 2.0?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. A couple of things there, let me unpack them all. One, the EFR loans that we have exited and some
syndication lines that we exited, again, those were all non-core and they reflected our excess liquidity that we had
in the company. And let's go back to the days of 2020, when we had $6 billion to $7 billion of cash sitting at the
Fed, earning 10 basis points. It was a good alternative to increase net interest income and it was excellent asset
quality, and that's what we did there.
We're not – as we continue to reemerge from this, first things first, I want to say our focus near term is on moving
that deposit ratio down and also moving the capital levels up, and we're going to do that with a heavy focus and
concentration on deposit growth and, again, a more muted growth in loans, about 500-plus million dollars. As we
emerge from Q4 and position ourselves for 2024, we should be just about ready as we enter into 2024 to hit our
CET1 ratios and hit our liquidity – loan to deposit ratios.
Now, we've got plenty of opportunity here to grow. I think you'll see us go to some of our core strengths that have
always been with us, that have always helped us grow in the past. C&I loans out of warehouse lending is still
active. Now, part of this is going to be economically driven as well. Note financing is going to be there. We've
been strong in CRE, especially in lot banking. We've always had good performance out of our hotel book. Again, I
want to say very clearly, it's all dependent upon where the economy is at the end of 2023, moving into 2024.
But in the big picture, we will go back to some of the things that we've done well. But also during the course of the
remainder of this year, we have a number of different business lines that we are working on to developing, some
of those are on the deposit side and some of them are on the loan side. And as we've done every year, year and
a half, we've rolled out new business lines and opportunities to make sure we propel growth.
But I will say, Steve, in the past, we've been – if you go back and look from 2022 backwards to 2014, you've seen
we've grown loans and deposits on average, both, about 23% to 26% per year, right? We never got paid for that.
And I think what we're going to do is we're going to be a little more cautious on that loan growth, but again,
accelerating on the deposit side. So, one, we never have to experience a disruption with some information that
was put in the marketplace, which I think was inappropriate. But we can get to that point in another time. But I
think we're going to be a very steady grower. I think we should be able to grow above peer trend like we've

always have. I just don't think we're going to grow at the very top end of peer trend. I don't think that's necessary
for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I might add that we're really taking a surgical strike here on these types of things. So capital call, for example, I
mean, we got into that, as Ken said, when we had a lot of liquidity. Those are thinly priced deals and we did
syndications where we received no deposits. We're not exiting that space entirely. We're still going to do bilateral
deals with complete relationship and that's a way that we can kind of continue to be here, but really step away
from the stuff that, really, the marginal cost and marginal benefit from that is fairly muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just one follow-up. So, if I look at the deposit decline in the quarter,
right, the $3.3 billion you're calling out through March, the tech and innovation segment, we heard from many
other regional banks at this point that they were beneficiaries of the flight out of Silicon Valley Bank. What did you
hear from your customers through this period, which drove them to take deposits out of your bank? I would have
thought you could have been a beneficiary also, but they're just watching your stock price and panicking. What
was it and did they close accounts or they just bring balances down to the insured level? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. One, they didn't close accounts. They moved deposits out. So, let's kind of break down the deposit outflow.
$3 billion of the deposit outflow, 50% came out of our tech innovation and life science area. And Bridge Bank,
which is our technology and innovation arm of the company, was always set up as a challenger to SVB. So,
during the panic of Monday morning the 13th, I think people looked and said what most looks like SVB, well, here
is Western Alliance.
Now, what was interesting, only 14% of our deposits and about 11% of our total loans was in the tech and
innovation sector, right? But still, there was a lot of pressure put on our stock price and what you saw was a
modern day bank run, right? You saw heavy social media and commentary on social media which got
shareholders nervous, which drove the stock price down, we can talk about this little later, too, which then forced
some of the larger corporates that we had to – through treasury management systems to move their mouse, click,
point click and send the funds out. Then, we received a phone call that said, Gee, I'm sorry, I'm moving my
money, but I see the stock price going down and better to be safe than sorry.
68% of our dollars that went out went out to larger banks, the money center banks. And everyone, all said the
same thing. When the crises is over, we're going to come back and we'll wait and see if that happens. We'll wait
and see if they come back dollar for dollar. I doubt it. But they should come back because we haven't lost touch
with these folks, all right.
On the second part of your question as it relates to tech and innovation, we were still fighting the fight, hold on to
deposits during the – on the 13th and the 14th of March. Now, that has begun to change a little bit, and we are
more optimistic that deposit growth will begin to happen in our tech and innovation, and that kind of informs us to
say why we feel comfortable with growing $2 billion per quarter.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, really, I think the question starts with how did we get caught up in this? And we think the regional tie is
because, because of Bridge and the relationship that we have with the prime competitor to Silicon Valley Bank.
But for us, it was only 16% of our total versus for Silicon Valley Bank, it's basically their entire business. But – so
what happened is, is that issue, when the run started on SVB, I think they looked around, well, who else is in the
space and that perception quickly metastasized into a short narrative.
And if you looked at our options activity, we've written – a lot of days, we wouldn't trade options at all. But on that
Friday, March 10, we traded about a 1,000 times our normal volume. And the most common issue was somebody
bought $30 puts, mind you, this is what our stock is trading at $50, so they're $20 out of the money and they
expired next week, the March 17, in a week. To me, that's somebody that had an agenda and then on Monday
morning, before the market opens at 5 AM New York Time, they were in the pre-market session selling and
nobody trades pre-market, so it's pretty easy to move the stock price around and push it down, down, down. And
so we opened at $12 on Monday morning.
Well, that's what the print was. And so when depositors saw that, they go, oh, my gosh, you're down 75% over the
weekend, has that triggered an $8 billion withdrawal on that Monday? Now, we traded down into the sevens and
then nearly quadrupled and closed at $26 per share. That's not typical bank trading in terms of what goes on, but I
think the stock price recovery calmed down depositors and so we had a sharp drop, about 85%, in terms of
withdrawals on Tuesday and then since then has been basically flat. And after that entire week, we've been on
this kind of uptrend again.

business segments and what's – and how are you thinking about just the incremental of the deposit cost that's
coming into the bank? Yeah, if we can start that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. I'll split this up. I'll take the first half. I'll give Dale the second half. In terms of deposit growth, we see
deposit growth coming from our HOA segment, which was unaffected. And one of the lessons learned here, by
the way, when you take our technology, use APIs to connect the management company's technology and then
they connect to the HOA's back office or technology, those accounts and dollars can't move. That's a nine month
to a year conversion. And so one of the things that has informed us and what we're looking at is where else can
we find channels to do just that and be very deeply rooted into the back offices of our clients? But HOA is one
place where we expect growth.
Our new business lines, I'll take you back to 2018 and early 2019, building settlement services, building escrow
services, well, we just launched corporate trust, all those should contribute during the course of the year. And
then, we also have the natural build warehouse lending group and the regions have very strong brand recognition,
actually stronger than I would have thought. And so during the outflow, we only saw 3% to 5% in that range for
the regional bank branch, Torrey Pines, Bank of Nevada, Alliance Bank of Arizona, First Independent Bank and
Bridge Bank on the non-tech side.
And so we're going to make also a deeper commitment and a concerted effort to bring in more of that metro
banking there, because that for us is like our consumer deposits, okay. We're not a consumer shop, but those
deposits are very sticky. And to combine your question with Steve's question from before, one of the things that
we've learned, this is really interesting, if someone called us up and said during the crisis of Monday and
Tuesday, and really it was just Monday and Tuesday, mostly Monday, to be honest with you, right, and said,
what's going on? If we had that conversation, that was a conversation that nine out of ten times we can hold on to
the client. But if you are a larger corporate and you moved your money really quick, it is hard to rationalize a
person out of a position that they did not rationalize themselves into. So, if you made a decision out of fear, it's
hard to get to that person.
Well, our metro banking clients and depositors, that's a conversation that they know Dale Gibbons, who calls on
them every couple of weeks, they trusted that, all right, and that's a way to grow. Additionally, I think one of the
things we also learned is more information in terms of times of trouble really is very helpful. The 8-Ks that we put
out were certainly important for the markets, but really it was done so that our business development officers
could talk very specifically to our clients and give them very specific data. The more specific the data, the more
concrete and finite, the better they felt.
If you said, Gee, we've been here for 40 years and we believe in customer service and all that, great. But they
needed to see things like, what is your loan – sorry, what is your insured to uninsured, how much coverage do
you have? When you have that data put into the marketplace and then the BDOs can then take it and talk to
clients, that was very helpful. So I went a little further than just your question there. I'll let Dale take on the cost
side here on this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, yeah. Ebrahim, yeah, regarding the cost, as we talked last year, we're not playing the baby game. We were
trying to say that we're doing better than others perhaps because our beta is lower in terms of how fast we're

raising our funding cost. We were there where the market was when the price was all along and we know what
that is. And so today, that's kind of where we are as well.
I don't think many banks can really pull in much in deposits as something meaningfully different than effective Fed
funds. And so that's what we've dialed in in terms of what we can do, but we do have these – a variety of
initiatives as well as our current array of deposit gathering divisions whereby we can continue to execute on that,
and I think that's demonstrated by what we've done for the past three weeks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And maybe, Dale, I guess a different way [indiscernible] (00:39:01) outlook, 3.65%-3.75%, how do you think about
if the Fed is done with the rate hikes, say, in the next quarter and rates remain flat from there, where do you
expect the margin to exit 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, it's really kind of where that is, where that guide is. As I mentioned, the volatility we have around
our margin, our net interest income in different rate environments is almost nil, less than 1%, whether up or down,
shock or ramp. So, that's intact.
I mean, in terms of what we go from this 3.79% to this guide of just a little bit lower than that, I think it's important
to remember that 3.79% has a couple of things in it that are depressing that number. One is it has a very large
cash position that we had for three weeks of March basically, whereby we took down large dollars from the FHLB
or the FRB and we had it in cash. I mean, our balance sheet was close to $90 billion on some of those days and
we ended the quarter at $71 billion. That was at an upside down spread. That costs our margin by 11 basis
points.
In addition, we talk about the HFS loans that are coming out of here that have a spread of 2.3%. If you take that
out of our margin at 4.79%, our margin rises about 20 basis points. So the 4.79% is already depressed. And so
going – holding that level or declining slightly, I think that maybe helps with the modeling.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch on the borrowing pay down. By my math, you guys – if you
guys continue to grow loans, deposits at $500 million, $2 billion, respectively, you get to that mid-80s by the end –
by summer 2024. Can we expect the borrowings to be the use of the excess liquidity as you get there ratably and
to what level?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Yeah. I mean I think your borrowings are going to come down, obviously, to a level – I don't have a dollar figure
for you, Casey, but, yeah, we'll take them down. I mean we operated last year with a borrowing position in kind of
the mid-single-digits, could be lower than that, but we still expect to be using the FHLB and they also are a good
accordion basically for day-to-day liquidity as people withdraw or deposits come in and things like this and so
that's a pretty stable source to do something like that. What we don't want to do is we don't want to rely on the
FHLB for just standard operating liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think your numbers are about right. We could maybe get to that loan-to-deposit ratio a little bit sooner, that'll be
informed by our deposit activity, right. So, if we do a better job, it'll come down quicker, but I think your number –
your direction is about right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And on the efficiency ratio guide, I got that. Just obviously there's a lot going on in the near term or
in the last month. Just wondering if you could give an expense run rate for the second quarter? This is a starting
point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So what I'd rather say is – yeah, I think what I'd rather say is, the guide is in the mid to high 40s. And the expense
run rate for us or the efficiency ratio, I've said this on many calls, is really the exhaust fumes that comes out from
the business. So, we know where we want to get to in terms of EPS. And you can kind of back into certain things
we won't sacrifice. We're not going to sacrifice the build that we've been doing in risk management programs, in
technology and technology itself and by the by, it was because we put so much money into our technology, our
payment systems all work really well. We had no fails. So, we're very pleased with that.
And also the reason why we're able to have some confidence around going – the go forward into deposit growth
is from new businesses that we have cultivated since 2018 and 2019, specifically on the deposit side. So, those
things are going to continue. If we don't put money into the company to grow and you're not going to have
sustainable deposits and sustainable loan growth. So, I didn't give you a very specific answer to Q2, but I'm just
telling you mid to high 40s is what we're going to do inside of the overall outlook that I presented.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. And just last one for me, if I take the spot rates that you guys provide in the slide deck and then give you
credit for all of the HFS sales and layer in that high 40s efficiency ratio, I get above 14% ROA and an 18%
tangible ROE. Does that sound about right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A

14% ROA, is it for the full – for the year, you mean?

balance sheet restructuring, the $6 billion fully offloaded.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Yeah. So, maybe you're a little bit off and I think it's because you are jumping to the efficiency ratio instantly

...I don't know what high means, but I mean – yeah. So, remember we're still going to have – a lot of these $3
billion that's already contracted, that's coming in this quarter in terms of disposition, some more will probably as
well, but that's going to linger a little bit. And so that would – is a revenue source that really doesn't have an
expense tied with it. So, you may be a little bit – you may be jumping up too quickly.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, just wanted to – hey, hey, Ken. Just wanted to follow up on the spot rate discussion, I was encouraged to
see those lower – on the deposit rates at the end of the quarter. Do you think that's sort of a one-time
phenomenon and would you expect those to sort of accelerate again? I think you mentioned you thought your
deposit growth would mostly come from higher cost sources, but just wanted to get a sense of sort of squaring
those spot rates versus kind of what's going on in the environment with your deposit growth goals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, so I mean, yeah, I mean, I do think that we have two sources of deposit growth here. One of them is at a
more marginal cost and that's going to be kind of new money, I believe. And the other is recovery of funds from

clients that pulled funds out in kind of the last three weeks of March. And I think that we're going to have success
on both of those categories. In terms of where the lower cost money went or came from, it really was
predominantly in the tech space. We've talked to getting better prices and a lot of them say they're going to come
back. They just want to see a little bit of calmness and stability and re-enter the space. And so, I think we're on
track with that. So I think that's a portion of what you're going to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And do you have a sense for maybe ECR deposit growth, I mean, those were basically flat linked quarter,
what percentage would that be of kind of how you're thinking about growth throughout the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think ECR deposit growth is going to climb as well. A lot of that comes from different elements of our HOA
division as well as our mortgage warehouse operation and escrow funds related to principal and interest and title
and taxes and insurance, those have ECRs with them, and I think we're optimistic about how that can go this
year, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a follow-up on the loan spot rates that you disclosed on slide 14. You gave the average of
6.28%, but I assume that includes the loans that you moved to held-for-sale at the end of the quarter. With the
spot of 6.45%, is that – I assume that would exclude those loans held for sale, so it would be up fairly materially
over the average if I were able to back out those loans that you moved. Is that the right way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It is the right way to think about it. Yeah, and we've kind of, I'll say, reverse engineered it on page 18, where we
took the spot yields for the entire quarter and what that was in that spread, and hence, coming up with $31 million
is the revenue piece associated with the HFS disposition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then finally for me. The bucket that you term as 2C, I guess, the $3 billion of non-contracted plans
sales. Is there anything that – in your mind that would hold that up or maybe why that isn't – I mean, I know you
guys have been extremely busy, why that isn't under contract yet and then just appetite for further unwinding of
any additional credit-linked notes that you might have out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, I think, it's important to say that we've got 50% of that already cemented and we're just waiting to close
towards the end of April. The other $3 billion we're in active conversations with. And so, we don't see any reason
why we're not going to get it done by the end of Q2. I mean, could something drag into – a little bit into Q3?
Maybe. But right now, we're encouraged with the conversations we're having with the parties across the table
from us.

Brad Milsaps Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No – well, there will be some more CLNs that unwind as we – as part of the $3 billion that we're looking to sell.
And that's all factored into our net CET1 side that we have. Of course, you lose capital efficiency when you
unwind them, but you're getting rid of the assets on the other side. Net-net, these transactions are all capital
accretive to us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A

Yeah. The capital call and subscription CLN, which is the one we're talking about, is already contracted. It's being
unwind daily. We're taking – they're taking loans out of that every day. And so, it's just whittling down. I think it's
going to be over by the end of this month. And so, that will be gone. In terms of the other CLNs we have, we have
– we still have three that are all residential. We don't have plans to unwind or dismantle those.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Looking at the HQLA build in the quarter, can you tell us where we are in that process, maybe
provide like HQLA to total assets? And as you continue to build that out, is that additive to the current securities
balances or is there going to be some additional repositioning that kind of keeps the securities book flat while
HQLA grows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So yeah, I mean we're going to be taking that up. I don't have a limit for you. I mean, there's demands
associated with HQLA as you surpass $100 billion. So we're going to be on a trajectory to kind of have that rise.
And so, over time, I think it could displace something else in the AFS book or whatever that we have presently.
But I wouldn't look for that to be – that's not going to be some substantial kind of step – set variable that you've
got to leg into. It's going to be something that as our loan-to-deposit ratio descends, we're going to be climbing
that ratio, but we're not going to – it's not going to jump in any substantial way that's going to, I don't know, disturb
margin or things like this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.

back to lessons learned, if some large corporates bring back their money, then we need to assign a higher level of

volatility to those dollars and then hold some of those dollars in HQLA. So, that also will be part of the composition
mix fabric of the new deposits coming in that we're going to have to determine.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Chief Banking Officer-Regional Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Yeah. Right. And the funding schedule for the rest of the year rolls out at about $400 million a quarter. So,
within our funded loan balances and for our projections, that's accounted for in the volume. That represents the
trajectory of the unfunded for this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, one last one for me and maybe going back to Steve's question. On the bigger picture front
here, where do you ultimately see Western Alliance falling into the broader technology innovation sector once that
recovers, assuming there's going to be quite a lot of dislocation from Silicon Valley clients? And do you ultimately
see Western Alliance playing a larger role in that sector?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think it's going to be a sector that's going to be positioned against the other growth areas that we have. So, it's
not going to be – it's not going to overwhelm the deposit composition or the loan composition. That's something
we've seen. So, we're not going to be the new tech bank. But I do feel very strongly that the others that are
picking up the tech people out of SVB, and there have been a number of banks, I think people are going to
migrate to us and stay with us because, one, consistent performance is very important here, not only consistency
of the people that you deal with, but consistency of the credit-granting process and the credit review.
And we've seen over our time here, banks that have jumped into tech and innovation and they think it's C&I
lending. Tim Bruckner can pick up on this in a second if you'd like, but it is not. And we've seen people jump in
and say, hey, I'm here to provide you credit, and all of a sudden, they see, wait a minute, you're lending against
possible negative cash flows or clearly negative cash flows. You're lending against VC's commitments to put in
money over time. It's a different C&I loan.
So, Tim, you want to pick up on that?

Hey. Good afternoon. I was curious if you guys – I mean, just kind of philosophically speaking, Western Alliance
has always been entrepreneurial in both the left and the right side of the balance sheet. And it seems like on the
left side, you guys are retrenching, you're sticking with your core clients. And partially, given the volatility and then
also just economically speaking, I'm sure you're tapping the brakes a little bit. But as we shift beyond a recession
or go through one and get through the other side, has the DNA changed on how Western Alliance operates?
Could we see you guys reenter the markets that you've left, just kind of thinking longer term growth and where
that could come from?

Yeah. Well, first, let me say, culturally, we pride ourselves on being entrepreneurial. Many people think it's in on
the business development side, whether we bring in deposits or loan growth. And I would say, yeah, you're
correct if you think about that. I think where we excel in our entrepreneurial behavior is two: in times of crisis and
in times of working out transactions with clients. So, you want to see our entrepreneurial behavior, go back and
look at COVID and look at our hotel book, which probably back then was $3 billion. We had projections of
anywhere from us losing $100 million to $1 billion in that book, right? We moved quickly. We put a program in
place that I don't – I think maybe only one other bank use, which was in order to get a deferral, you had to put
money up. So, every month of deferral you wanted, you actually had to put up a month of cash.
And while that did not seem to sit immediately well with our sponsors, once they understood that what we were
trying to do and get them to commit to their projects so we could then commit to any new deals that they wanted
to do, then we had almost 100% uptake in that program. What's the benefit of that program? Everyone was
projecting large losses, not one late payment we declared, not one late payment. So, what you saw here, okay,
we did have it on a rush for liquidity to run out of this bank on Monday. I will tell you, by Tuesday, late afternoon,
we already had the basis of the plan that we're talking to you about here today in terms of moving to sell down
noncore assets.
We also believe moving quickly – and by the way, this was very connected to what we told everyone in Q3 and
Q4 coming out of – moving out of our EFR loans, capital call and subscription lines, and also getting out of some

corporate finance credits, which we thought may have some potential credit weakness down the road. But we
moved so quickly that that allowed us to lock up deals for the low marks that you see that we noted here on the
early part of our slide deck. That's the entrepreneurial behavior that we have here.
And so, yeah, you could say, we're retrenching. Right now, we're using all that entrepreneurial behavior to build
capital, to make sure we have a good deposit franchise, a better deposit franchise. You saw that, by the way,
from moving our insured deposit level from 45% to 73% inside of five weeks. We went – we moved. When we put
our mind to do something, it gets done very quickly.
And so, yeah, to one of the other former questions from one of the other analysts, yeah, Q2/Q3, you're going to
see sort of this flattish type of balance sheet. But as we begin to emerge out of Q4, assuming that we're on track
with all the capital and all the liquidity that we want to do, and that's perhaps job one, I just want to make sure
everyone understands that, our DNA will be in full view again as we build into 2024.
The only thing I'll say is we don't need to grow as fast, right? Again, we weren't rewarded for growing as fast. And
the other thing I'll say, it's all going to be informed again by where the economy stands and what's happening in
the economic environment and macro factors. Okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. That was great color. Appreciate it. Confidence is the best capital in this environment. The only other
question I had is kind of just where your share price is today. Seeing WAL under tangible book is like seeing a
snowman in Phoenix. I'm just kind of curious, your appetite of share purchases. I know you're trying to build
capital, so that would fly in the face of this, but just anything on that end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. That's not in the conversation at the moment. Will not be in the conversation until we cross over 11% and
then, the decision then will be – it'll be dependent upon the economy and other economic events. We'll reassess
capital management alternatives at that time. But that's not something that's, boy, it hasn't even contemplated
here or even discussed.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Hey. So, I wanted to touch on credit and I appreciate the guidance [indiscernible] (01:03:29). And I wanted to get
a better sense of how you think this credit normalization process will play out for Western Alliance, particularly for
this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Chief Banking Officer-Regional Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Hi. Tim Bruckner. First, I'd say that as we look at our portfolio right now, it's performing and doing exactly
what we want it to do in this economy. We're, at our foundation, a relationship bank. And at our foundation, we're
a direct lender. And we don't enter into transactions where we're complicated with mezzanine and sub-debt and
so forth. So we've got direct, frank, straightforward and ongoing dialogue with each of our customers in that
sense. So when we talk about how we're doing, how we relate, that's informed by those active dialogue.
So as you can expect right now in segments like office, we're out in front of the customer with dialogue, in the
present environment, discussing. So I expect that you see a stability. With any economic downturn, I expect that
there's also a chance for some migration to criticized or special mention. We don't see significant migration to us
based on the direct relationship and the active dialogue that we're having. That holds true across all segments
that we lend in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then my follow-up was – that was as far as the uptick in classified assets, is that kind of the general
story there as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Chief Banking Officer-Regional Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. All right. And just one more follow-up with the PPNR guidance. Within that, what is the outlook for
AmeriHome going forward for the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So actually, quietly, AmeriHome is having a good several weeks here. And what I would tell you is that, overall,
production margins have improved to more historic normalized levels. That happened towards the end of Q1 and
it continues into the current quarter. And I would kind of say that the mortgage income that we earned in Q1
probably is about right as we move forward.
And what's helped us here is the retreat of a large money center bank. I don't know why we just don't say Wells,
but the retreat of Wells on the correspondent lending market combined with industry capacity rationalization has
paved the path towards higher margins and higher win rates. And so, we knew the market would have to rightsize
itself. It's taken a little bit longer than we'd like. But it has – it seems like it's getting there now. And so, that's the
color around AmeriHome at the moment.

Operator: The next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead, Gary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask another question just with regard to kind of the use of net inflows of
deposits over the next few quarters. I think the question was already asked in terms of the securities portfolio. But
finished the quarter at $3.5 billion of cash and equivalents. That's about 5% of your total balance sheet. It's about
double where you've been historically, in most quarters at least. Is that sort of a level that you'd kind of target over
time or do you think that it trends back towards that, call it, 2.5%, 3% level over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think that can hold over time. We're holding a bit more cash than we usually do presently. I think that can
probably trend lower, right, but the overall liquidity position. And again, and as Ken indicated, I mean, as –
assuming we get continued deposit recovery here, our coverage of uninsured remains robust, and I think that will
inform what that liquidity profile has to look like in terms of what funds return and what volatility might be
associated with them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the ECR or the deposit costs in the quarter. Since ECR deposits were
essentially flat in the quarter, I would've assumed that that expense item would have moved up a little bit more
given kind of the fourth quarter hikes and then the hikes we had in the first quarter. So, I was just wondering if
there were any changes structurally to the ECR rates or anything along those lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. It's interesting and maybe somewhat counterintuitive. But what's transpired is that a lot of the funds we lost,
they were larger. And so, consequently, they were higher. And so, we lost ECR deposits that were among the
highest that we paid. And so, the actual rate of increase went down because the mean spread relative to, say,
under Fed funds [indiscernible] (01:09:37).

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So potentially, as you talk about maybe recovering some of those ECR deposits that have flowed out, that
number could have a little bit volatility to it separate from the rate environment for some period of time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Highly possible.

Operator: The next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Chris, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Dale, just following up on that one. Obviously, there is a correlation between your NIBs and the
ECRs. Just given the change in the deposit mix over the last year, I guess, how do you see that 35% noninterest-
bearing mix progressing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
In this elevated rate environment, I think it's fairly difficult to get say a new DDA that no ECR and in noninterest
bearing. So I think that – I mean, at the same time, the dollars that are still there have been through a little bit of
volatility and they're still here. So my impression is that as we grow, we'll grow outside of that. And so, that will
continue to whittle down proportionately. But I don't really see dollar exit from that category. And we possibly
could get some recovery. As I mentioned, most of the dollars that went out were in the tech space and a number
of those clients have said, we'll be back when the storm settles a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just so I make sure – that's helpful. Just to make sure I understand. So the $16.5 billion of NIB you have, what
you're saying is the dollars shouldn't be declining at nearly the same rate as what they have, but the mix will have
a bias because the growth [indiscernible] (01:11:40). Is that the right interpretation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, the mix will have a bias – the proportionate mix will have a bias downward, but the dollars will be fairly
steady. That's what I meant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. That's exactly. Okay. Got it. And then maybe if I could, you talk about the mid-80s and the 11% as kind of a
medium-term target. You gave your efficiency for this year. As you kind of exit the year, I think somebody asked,

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
I'm going to ask a little bit different, the kind of the efficiency ratio of the company when we're all done with the
adjustments, how do we think about it relative to that mid-to-upper-40 if you're thinking out one to two years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So that's a harder projection to make. I would state that, and as Ken was indicating, AmeriHome seems to be
getting real legs at the moment. We'll have to see how that plays out. But if the rate environment – I personally
think we're going to be in a declining rate environment in 2024 going into the general election, and I think that's
probably bullish for mortgages. And with that, that could be a greater proportion of our revenue than what it's been
for the past two quarters. And their mark – their efficiency ratio is in, like, the low-50s. So that would be something
that would keep it up. Also, the revenue piece would be meaningful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Terrell with Stephens. Please go ahead, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Question on the CET1 pickup from the dispositions. So, the $3 billion of contracted sales in
the second quarter gets you a 50 bp or so CET1 pickup or 33 bps net of the CLN. I guess if there's $3 billion of
loans remaining beyond that, that aren't contracted for sale just yet, but no further CLN repositioning, I guess
should we think about the CET1 pickup from that last $3 billion pull is closer to kind of a 50 basis point lift in the
CET1?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, a good question. So, what we have here is we believe we're going to be – exceed 10%. So, is all of that $3
billion going to be disposed of in the second quarter? I can't tell you that. We've got $3 billion contracted, that'll go.
So, is there some tail there associated with it? But when it's all gone, there's more pickup there than just to get
you over again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then, apologies if you disclosed this, but how much should be MSR sale impact servicing
revenues this quarter and any expectation for go-forward MSR sales?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, the MSR was sold, I think, on the last day of the quarter. So, it didn't really impact any of our servicing
income for Q1. It was a significant sized $360 million. And we did that in the face of a large money center bank
that's disposing of their MSRs. And we did it right on top of par, right on top of our marks. So, we're very pleased
that we're able to get a sizable deal off. That gives us a lot of optionality to when we want to come back to the
market if we want to come back to the market and the size of the deals. We may do smaller deals. If we think the
pricing could be better, there's no rush to go ahead and do them.

And so – and again, I would also say if the mortgage market – to Dale's viewpoint of the world, if the mortgage
market begins to pick up at a faster pace, then maybe I have to retreat from some of my statements and we have
to do some sales. But right now, we don't see that we're going to have to do any sales and we get all the
optionality going one way as to when we want to launch a deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We manufacture MSRs. And so, if you look at the ending balance, if you start with the beginning balance,
take out $360 million, obviously that ending balance is higher than that. So, it's going to be a fairly stable balance
on average, but it's going to move up and down as they manufacture them every day and then as we dispose of
them periodically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I will say we're getting a lot of reverse inquiries and people want all of them. And so – and we'll manufacture it.

Operator: The next question comes from Brody Preston with UBS. Please go ahead, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. So, I have a few questions. I just wanted to ask maybe on the asset
sensitivity, just given that the balance sheet sensitivity is down when I layer in the mortgage and then the deposit
cost that flow through NIE. Dale, is it fair to say that the earnings stream is liability sensitive in the current rate
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, we probably think it's pretty close to zero here. And you do have a pickup potentially on the deposit cost, like
you're alluding to. But, again, we're showing that it's a little bit asset-sensitive presently, but, like I said, less than
1%. So, we put it all together and with and without deposit cost as margin or non-interest expense, it's pretty
neutral.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We've got one increase coming up at this next meeting, it's 25% and then we have two go late in the year, I
think it's November and December.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Cuts, two cuts. Yeah. You may not believe that, that's what we have in our model. Basically tracks the futures
running off of.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, on the deposit rates, I think the interest-bearing deposit rate was 2.82% spot versus the
2.75% at quarter end. The average was up, I think, it was like 75 basis points to 80 basis points quarter-over-
quarter. So, just trying to help think about the step-up in deposit costs going forward. Do you think that the spot
rate is indicative of where you would expect the 2Q deposit rate, interest-bearing deposit cost to come in or do
you think it'll kind of be another 70 basis point or 80 basis point increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Oh, no. Oh, no. No. I mean your spot rate is as of March 31. So, what's going to change it from there? We have
one rate increase in early May 2025. And then, what's the proportion that's going to follow through? So, it could
be up a little bit more than that. We wouldn't expect it to be much more. We're not seeing kind of intra account
volatility. We saw some of that earlier, but a lot of these are indexed at various levels to Fed funds. So, I think it's
going to be more. I mean the big increase you had from Q4 to Q1 was you had significant raises. They were still
doing 75 basis points back then in Q4 and that did layer in that kind of that for the full year on an average basis.
So, going from 1.79% to 2.75% was really because the 1.79% rate was held back from the average rate and how
quickly they were still moving the funds back in the late 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just on the inter-quarter deposit swings, I think it was the March 9 update you gave where you're up $8
billion for the quarter. Could you tell us what were the categories that drove that upswing? Which ones kind of
flowed out and how much of that you could expect to maybe get back and if that's encompassed within your
guidance for deposit growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, yeah, we were up $8 billion, just under $8 billion as you mentioned. We would typically have seen
some of those funds to go down a little bit. We were targeting they were actually going to be up $4 billion for the

quarter instead of $7.8 billion, because we thought we'd lose a little bit in mortgage warehouse deposits in
particular, that would flow out. We also had some other dollars and things that we're going to be pulling out.
Well, that happened and in fact, we had some of those dollars, a little bit more than we expected. And then, we've
mentioned Settlement Services, which is another division. I mean they were off to a very strong Q1 in particular,
but those accounts had just come in. I mean so, we opened accounts that had been here for single-digit weeks.
And then, with all the volatility that took place and I think it kind of spooked them a little bit when they saw our
share price on Monday, the 13th. And so, they took it out. Now, for those we do have commitments for many of
them that they were kind of surprised by this and they think they're coming back.
So, we're pretty optimistic about what's going to reverse there. But it was a little bit like lifeboat, last in first out. I
mean, so a brand new account wasn't as sticky as something that had been here before with more tenure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
They hadn't experienced our service levels and our performance. It was easy for them to move. But those folks
that have been with us that understood service levels and performance and how important it is, those funds did
move. And we've been on the road last week meeting with just a number of settlement service clients and future
clients and there is a big pipeline that's building out there. So, we hope to gain our fair share of that – of those
settlements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And if I could sneak one last one, a little bit ticky-tack in, just on the mortgage servicing rights that you sold,
could you maybe ring-fence what the unpaid principal balance was? I mean if I just look at the valuation, it looks
like it was like maybe $22-ish billion, I guess maybe if I get back into it, but just help us ring-fence that. And then, I
just wanted to clarify that there was no gain on that that flowed through the servicing income line item this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
There was no gain on that that went through there. Yeah, I don't have that number in front of me, but I think your
math is about right based upon basis points per dollar.

so – and there were several things that went on there in terms of tweets people are familiar with that I think
accelerated it.
What we've taken note of is kind of volatility around some of this stuff and we'll reflect that in what – how we
consider what we need in HQLA liquidity kind of going forward. But, hey, we're committed to the tech space and
when we think that there's, value to be created for us and for them in that space. But maybe the duration risk is
shorter than others might have thought.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Lessons learned there, about a third to 40% of our total deposits were operating accounts tied to loan
commitments where we had to be the primary banking relationship. Those deposits didn't flow out, that's number
one. Number two, the other thing, I like what we did and this goes back to the original Bridge team when they
started the company to be a challenger brand to SVB was to focus on the portfolio companies and not the venture
capital funds.
So, those dollars are less likely to flow in and out on the operating accounts than they are with the venture capital
funds. So, that was something that was started that we continue. That was, I think, a good decision. I think, for us,
going forward, we now need to tie more of the deposit commitment to the loan documents such that if they do
move money, the penalty pricing is severe. Today, it's a nuisance, but we're going to tie and may get more severe
in order to keep those deposits with us.
And by the by, if you want a relationship and you want the experience that we bring, you're going to need to bring
deposits to the table. And that's what we say, by the way, to all clients that we sit across the table from them, and
we say we're happy to make your business very, very successful, that's what we want to do, you've got to do the
same for us. So, we're giving you credit. We need that deposit relationship and we need those sticky deposits.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Great. Okay. Thanks. Really, that's helpful. And then, in terms of the deposit outlook, the $2 billion per quarter,
how much of that is predicated on deposits that flowed out of the bank in the last month or so coming back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It's a mix, to be honest with you. I don't know that I can give you a very specific number how much is returning
versus how much is new. I will tell you that this whole disruption gave us an opportunity to spend more time with
our clients. If there's any silver lining, that's good. To certain clients, during the heart of the disruption, we were
talking to them every day if they wanted to. But it also gave them much more access to the senior management
teams and allows us now to call on them. So, I can't give you a number, but we feel more comfortable with the
overall $2 billion coming back per quarter – $2 billion growth per quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Coffey Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Okay. And since you're getting back to just old fashioned relationship-based banking here, is there a
minimum interest spread that you're looking at or targeting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, the answer is yes by different loan categories. Okay? And as Dale said, we're basically pricing at the margin
today. So, effective Fed funds gets offset by SOFR plus. And that spread is what drives us. And overall, the
spread is very close to what you see as our net interest margin spread. So, different if you're doing a construction
loan versus the C&I loan versus a hotel loan versus a warehouse lending, but the blend of those spreads are
pretty much seen in our net interest margin rate.

David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
Thank you. I know we're getting late. Just a few quick ones on capital. Do you have plans for additional credit-
linked note issuance from here, given the way that you've re-evaluated the existing CLN base? Is it something
you've ruled out or just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It's something we don't need going forward at this point. And it's expensive.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Very expensive. So, when we're done, we – so we don't need that incremental cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
Okay. Can you talk about what changed that led to that reevaluation, because it was something that the bank had
done a decent amount of in recent quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, I mean one of the benefits of them was that you've got a reduction in risk-weighted assets when it held
capital. We're moving away from that to a higher capital level so that whatever the next storm is with that and with
our insured deposit levels in the top decile relative to the 50 largest banks, we're not going to be in a situation for
a short game. And so, I don't think the CLNs were productive in avoiding that scenario.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
Okay. And with the new 11% target, is that something you view as a long-term target for Western Alliance or do
you think it will come back down towards, say, 10% after everything settles down at some point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think, as I said, we want to be competitive with the money center banks. Now, no one is ever going to confuse
JPMorgan and Western Alliance as one in the same company, or at least not in the next quarter. Let me just say
that. Says here pause for laughter.
But I think one of the things we learned when we're out on the road talking to non-sophisticated banking people,
they understand their business, they're very smart, but they don't spend a lot of time. For us to come in to say our
capital, like there are a number of studies that were done that we used that put into the model CET1 less HTM
marks, less AFS marks, right?
And when we went in and we showed people and talked to people and said that we were one of the best in terms
of this adjusted CET1, they didn't have to understand what the word adjusted meant, they didn't have to
understand CET1. But when they heard our percentage and compared it to a lot of the other large money center
banks, and we were higher than that, boom, they understood that. As I said to folks, if my mom was alive, what
she was, she was over 90, I made it as simple as I could if she was alive to tell her. Money center bank A was at
6%, we're at 8%. We're better. Money center B has insured deposit level of this, we're higher. When people just
got that very basic math, the meetings went very, very well and it was well understood, and they were able to
check the box and say let's move on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Bernstein/Autonomous
Got it. Thank you.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. This can be quick. The provision, it looks like it was driven by a charge-off and it feels like you're
comfortable with credit, and growth is slowing intentionally. But anything that prevents that provision from coming
way back down next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, yeah, I mean it was driven by a charge-off. We had or we disclosed in there, we had a debt obligation of,
actually, Signature Bank. And so, we've written that off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. But just in terms of the provision.
[indiscernible] (01:32:53)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
...Tim Bruckner's comments about credit quality, they are whole.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. So, you don't feel like you need to be building reserves here I guess is my...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We don't know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Chief Banking Officer-Regional Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Not any way other than the consistency that we've seen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then, back to the return question, when you guys flesh out your model, are you a
mid-teen return on tangible company? Is that the goal, or are you a high-teen return on tangible company? How
do you think about that in your mind?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
In terms of return on average tangible common equity...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Return on tangible, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think we're going to be low-20s or greater as we move forward through the end of the year and into 2024.
Remember, too, that with a smaller balance sheet and small – and less spread income, the fee income plays a
more dominant role. And that's coming from AmeriHome. And right now, we're seeing – we got fingers crossed
when we say this, we're seeing the trends move in our favor. And I think that's going to give us a little extra push
in the return on an average tangible common equity ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. That's a good message with your valuation. And then, I guess last question, it probably would've
been a good first question, but do you feel like you're dealing with any abnormal stresses right now at your
company? Or is this kind of over in terms of managing the stressful situations from mid-March?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
All right. So, I want to be careful that I'm not like George Bush that things are signed on the aircraft carrier that
says mission accomplished, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. [indiscernible] (01:34:48)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The waters are calmer. Okay? So, I think what's important is what we returned to a lot more calm as it relates to
the depositors starting the Wednesday – February 15, cash inflows and outflows are about the same. And as you
saw starting on the 20th or thereabouts, we started to grow and we've grown.
And so, there is calm with the depositors. For us, there is still a heightened level of sensitivity to make sure that
everything we just said on this call gets executed upon, right. And that to me is an incredibly important. One, of
course, we like to be known as a company that's transparent, but also when we tell you we're going to do
something, we do it. We also like to be known as trying to be a little more innovative to looking at problems and
solving them and then solving them right away.
So, if you're asking me about anxiety and what keeps me up at night is making sure that we work hard to execute
on everything that we've said here. If you're asking me for what the other one or two events that could be out
there that maybe could impact the industry a little bit, I think First Republic hasn't been solved yet, but I think we
have now shown that we are completely different and separated from that company, there was a point where
whatever happens to them affected us, but I think we have now separated ourselves from there.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2023
And the other thing that we are just waiting for is you saw that Fitch gave us – kept us investment grade but lower
a notch or two. We still have one of the rating agency that is probably going to do something or other since
they've had us on watch and we're waiting for that.
But we saw no outflow with any impact to Fitch zero, no incoming calls, zero. And we just want that one last item
to be passed and then it's all about execution or it's still right execution on the plan that we presented here and
also working on growth.
So, what I think you saw here during the cause of this crisis is management's dexterity. I've said that to our board
several times. We can balance a few things, keep a few balls in the air and do them well. I like to think we did
okay through this whole crisis here. And that's what's front and center in our minds these days, Jon.
I appreciate the big question at the end.
