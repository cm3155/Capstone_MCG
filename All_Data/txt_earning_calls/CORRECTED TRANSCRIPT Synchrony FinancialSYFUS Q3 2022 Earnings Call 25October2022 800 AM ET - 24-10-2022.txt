President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong quarter of financial results,
highlighted by net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.8% and a
return on tangible common equity of 26.6%.
Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and resilient returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio,
our balanced approach to product, consumer and credit strategies, and the strength of our differentiated business
model.
As we continue to leverage our advanced digital capabilities, expand our reach through new partners and
distribution channels, and further diversify our product suite, Synchrony further solidifies himself as the partner of
choice for retailers, merchants and providers alike.
To that end, we added or renewed 15 partners in the third quarter and are excited to be partnering again with
Bassett and Floor & Decor. Bassett has chosen to partner with Synchrony again, because they value three of
Synchrony's core strengths: our superior customer experience; our advanced data analytics and ability to
leverage these data insights to drive growth; and the unique marketing opportunities that exist through
Synchrony's home network and marketplace, which will enable them to reach more customers and drive growth.
Meanwhile, Floor & DÃ©cor has selected to partner with Synchrony again because of our ability to power a multi-
product offering for both consumers and commercial customers. Floor & Decor is a high growth retailer and
believes that Synchrony is best positioned to help them achieve their objectives. So whether they're looking for
advanced data analytics and the powerful network effect of our marketplaces and networks, our seamless
omnichannel experiences, or our diverse suite of financial products and services, Synchrony is well-positioned to
deliver strong targeted outcomes for each of our partners.
We are increasingly anywhere our customer seeks tailored payment and financing solutions, big or small
purchases occurring in-person or digitally. We leverage our industry expertise, broad distribution channels and
dynamic financial ecosystem to connect our partners with customers whenever and however they want to be met,
with a broad range of products and services, attractive value propositions and seamless experiences that meet
their needs in any given moment. As a result, Synchrony continued to reach and serve more customers in the
third quarter.
On a core basis, excluding the impact of recent portfolio sales on prior-year periods, we added 5.8 million new
accounts and increased core average active accounts by 8% year-over-year. Purchase volume grew 6% to $44.6
billion or 16% on a core basis, reflecting both the increase in accounts as well as higher engagement across
those accounts, with 8% higher spend per account versus last year. This continued strength in purchase volume

was broad-based across our portfolio and a testament to the breadth and depth of our five sales platforms, the
compelling value propositions we offer and a healthy consumer.
At the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness,
Digital, and Home & Auto platforms; and single-digit growth in our Lifestyle platform. More specifically, Home &
Auto purchase volume was 11% higher, driven by strength in home, furniture and auto-related spend as well as
the impact of inflationary conditions on inventory, gasoline and automotive parts.
In Diversified & Value, purchase volume increased 20%, driven by higher out-of-partner spend, partner
penetration growth and strong retailer performance. Lifestyle purchase volume grew 6%, reflecting an industry-
specific rebound within luxury and higher out-of-partner spend more broadly. The 18% year-over-year increase in
Digital purchase volume generally reflected growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer
engagement, including higher active accounts and spend per account among our more established programs and
continued momentum in our new program launches.
The 16% increase in Health & Wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based growth in active accounts
and higher spend per active account in our dental and pet categories. We are particularly excited about the
opportunities we see in our Health & Wellness platform to reach more patients and provide them with greater
access to flexible financing. As healthcare costs continue to rise and the burden of out-of-pocket expenses
intensifies with the growth in high deductible healthcare plans, there is a clear and growing need for consumers to
have access to the financial solutions that empower them with choice; choice in how and when they manage the
costs of planned and unplanned medical procedures as well as elective care procedures.
Today, Synchrony's Health & Wellness platform encompasses more than 260,000 provider locations, 17 health
systems and approximately 75% of the country's dental and veterinarian practices through which we are
expanding access to patient financing. We are a leader in patient care financing for the last 35 years, yet we know
there is still more we can do to expand accessibility to Synchrony's patient financing product suite.
We continue to expand our Health & Wellness partnerships and drive product and experience innovations. We're
also broadening our distribution channels to reach and serve more customers through integrations with practice
management software providers like Epic and health systems like St. Luke's.
More recently, we announced our integration with Sycle, the audiology industry's number-one practice
management solution. Through this partnership, Synchrony will leverage Allegro Credit's leadership in the
audiology industry and deliver a comprehensive set of financing options, including both CareCredit healthcare
credit card and Allegro Credit's Buy Now Pay Later financing solutions to more than 5,000 US-based hearing
clinics.
Synchrony is deeply passionate about empowering Americans to have greater access to responsible and flexible
financing options whenever and however they need it. As we continue to add and renew existing leaders in the
Health & Wellness space, including our partnerships with Aspen, Heartland Dental, Sono Bello and American
Society of Plastic Surgeons, and expand our distribution channels with practice management software like Epic
and Sycle, Synchrony is increasingly the financial ecosystem at the center of patients' daily lives, empowering
them with choice and best-in-class value propositions that truly make a difference.
We believe there is no other consumer lender with the industry expertise, customer and provider reach, or
innovative solutions to help close the gap between Americans patient needs and a suite of financial resources to
address them.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Turning now to Synchrony's dual and co-branded cards, where we also continue to demonstrate momentum.
Purchase volume on these products grew 28% versus last year and represented about 39% of our total purchase
volume for the quarter. When tracking average transaction value and frequency trends across the major out-of-
partner spend categories of these products, we continue to see robust consumer demand across both
discretionary and nondiscretionary categories.
As we would expect, there have been some modest seasonal shifts among a few of the major categories in favor
of more education-related spend and less travel and entertainment spend. Otherwise, transaction values in gas
and auto-related spend have continued to show growth in line with gas price trends and inflation, while grocery
spend value is running relatively steady with the last few months.
The more recent pullback in gas prices appears to have contributed to a slight acceleration in broader
discretionary and nondiscretionary spend with categories like clothing, home furnishing and repair, bill pay and
auto-related spending, experiencing higher transaction value at similar frequency.
Putting this all together, the daily and monthly touch points that Synchrony has with our customers across a broad
range of purchases, tells us that consumer health remains strong and supportive of demand. Whether they're
taking care of everyday essentials like gas, groceries and medical expenses, or making more episodic
investments like buying a new mattress or replacing refrigerator, our customers are responsibly accessing
financing for their needs, maximizing the value they seek and managing well overall as they navigate the
pressures of inflation and the uncertainty of the markets.
Importantly, Synchrony's customer insights also inform many of the strategies across our business. We utilize this
data to deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers, greater outcomes for our
partners and more predictive insights for Synchrony as we manage our portfolio to deliver appropriate risk-
adjusted returns through cycles. Our sophisticated underwriting and diverse product suite allow us to respond
quickly to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions.
Synchrony combines our scale, more than 100 million open accounts and billions of transactions with external
data, including utility and telecom information, device identification and usage, cash flow and income data and
also with partner data like frequency and value of historical purchases, all to dimensionalize our customer and
their transactions. This enables us to more effectively engage and service our customers, make better credit and
fraud decisions and drive prudent profitable growth.
Once our customers begin utilizing our credit products, Synchrony leverages real-time indicators to monitor any
shifts in our borrowers' financial wellbeing. From transaction and payment behavior characteristics to credit
bureau alerts, we are closely in tune with our customers and can make both account and portfolio-level
adjustments quickly.
And of course, Synchrony's response and digital capabilities are complemented by our fully scaled, highly
experienced servicing teams to ensure that our customers have appropriate support when they need it. In short,
Synchrony's dynamic technology platform is what powers our ability to have a finger on the pulse of each
customer and harness the data into actionable insights so that we can optimize the outcomes for all stakeholders.
We are able to say yes to more customers more consistently and for the same level of risk even as market
conditions change. This is what ultimately provides invaluable continuity to our partners and customers and
resilient risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the third quarter financial performance in greater detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong third quarter results reflect a continued strength
of consumer and broad-based demand for the wide range of products and services that our ecosystem
seamlessly delivers. Purchase volume of $44.6 billion reflected a 6% increase compared to last year or 16% on a
core basis.
Continued strength in consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in the payment rate, contributed to 8%
higher average balances per account versus last year and 13% growth in ending receivables or 14% on a core
basis. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 23% of core receivables and increased 29% from the prior
year.
Net interest income increased 7% to $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in interest and fees due to
higher average loan receivables, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolios sold during the second quarter of
2022.
On a core basis, interest and fees increased 18%. Payment rate for the third quarter, when normalizing for the
prior year impact of portfolios recently sold, was 17.6%, approximately 10 basis points lower than last year, while
still approximately 200 basis points higher than our historical average.
Net interest margin was 15.52% in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7 basis points. The primary
driver of this increase was a 51 basis point improvement in loan yield, which contributed 42 basis points to net
interest margin.
Stronger liquidity portfolio yield also contributed 29 basis points. These improvements in our loan and liquidity
portfolio yields were partially offset by the anticipated increase in interest-bearing liability costs which increased
74 basis points to 2.05% in the quarter and reduced net interest margin by 62 basis points.
The mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 2 basis points. RSAs were $1.1
billion in the third quarter and 5% of average receivables. The $209 million year-over-year decrease was primarily
driven by the impact of the portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022 and program performance.
Provision for credit losses was $929 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a
growth-driven $294 million reserve build this year compared to $407 million reserve release in the prior year.
Other income decreased $50 million, primarily reflecting the impact of higher loyalty costs.
Other expenses increased 11% to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher employee costs and other expenses. Total other
expense included $27 million of additional marketing, growth reinvestment of Q2's $120 million gain on sale
proceeds. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, we expect that the gain on sale and the reinvestment
made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year will be EPS neutral for the full year 2022.
Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 36.5% compared to 38.7% last year. Excluding the effects of the gain
on sale reinvestment, the efficiency ratio would have been 35.6% and approximately 310 basis point improvement
versus last year.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Putting it all together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share for the third
quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.8% and return on tangible common equity of 26.6%.
These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model
combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our financial
ecosystem.
Synchrony is consistently able to meet a broad range of our customers' needs, while maintaining cost and credit
discipline, which allows us to sustainably grow while delivering consistent risk-adjusted returns.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. We continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the
credit spectrum of our portfolio. The vast majority of our borrowers continue to perform consistently with or better
than 2019 performance. We continue to monitor borrower behavior closely and note that consumers are still
slowly working through excess savings levels from peak levels.
The external data we track indicates due to the combination of summer spending and inflationary conditions, the
proportion of customers who received stimulus payments and have since spent the entire amount has increased
approximately 2 percentage points since July, now around 40% compared to 38% a few months earlier.
The remaining 60% of the customers still have a portion or all of the stimulus still saved. When tracking consumer
savings balance trends by tiers $0 to $2,500, $2,500 to $5,000, and balances greater than $5,000, the external
data suggests that during the course of the third quarter, the top two tiers of stimulus customers experienced
balance reductions of approximately $300, but have begun to rebound, while the bottom tier seen roughly $100 in
run-off.
Meanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust and portfolio payment rates remain elevated compared to our
historical five-year average. This suggests to us that borrowers still remain well-positioned to support robust
demand for goods and services, while responsibly meeting their financial obligations.
Turning to Synchrony's portfolio, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.28% compared to 2.42% last year and our
90-plus delinquency rate was 1.43% compared to 1.05% last year. Our third quarter net charge-off rate was 3%
versus 2.18% last year. This 82 basis point year-over-year increase generally reflected the gradual progression of
our credit losses towards our portfolio underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%.
Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.58%, down 7 basis points from the
10.65% in the second quarter.
Moving on to another source of Synchrony's strength, our capital liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of third
quarter reached $68.4 billion, an increase of $8.1 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured
funding sources increased by $1.6 billion. Altogether deposits represented 82% of our funding, while securitized
and unsecured debt represented 8% and 10%, respectively, at quarter end.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.3 billion or 20.1% of our total assets, consistent with last
year. We maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and secured and unsecured debt issuances,
and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits. We expect to continue to grow
our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured
issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Generally speaking, we manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow
our deposit base and actively encourage a rotation from savings to CDs, we're actively extending our deposit
duration. As a result, we expect to be slightly liability sensitive over the near term, while we continue to manage
interest rate through term maturities.
It's also important to note that through the mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return
on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of
rising interest rates on our business.
Moving on to discuss Synchrony's strong capital position. Note that we previously elected to take the benefit of
the seasonal transition rules issued by the joint Federal banking agencies. As a result, starting this past January
of 2022 and ending in January 2025, Synchrony makes an annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60
basis points to our regulatory capital metrics. The impact to the CECL has already been recognized in our income
statement and balance sheet.
With that in mind, we ended the quarter at 14.3% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis lower than last
year's level of 17.1%. The Tier 1 capital ratio is 15.2% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18% last
year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 16.5%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a
fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.1% compared to 26.6% last year.
We continued our track record of robust capital returns in the third quarter. In total, we returned $1.1 billion to
shareholders through $950 million of share repurchases and $109 million of common stock dividends. As of
quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $1.4 billion.
Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return considerable capital to our shareholders as guided by our
business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions.
Finally, please note that our full year 2022 outlook is outlined on slide 11, which has been updated in the following
ways. Ending loan receivable growth versus last year is now expected to be approximately 12% or more, up from
10%-plus previously. The net charge-offs will be approximately 3.05% for the full year, down from our prior
expectation of 3.15%. And RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables will be approximately 5.10% for the
full year, down from 5.25% previously.
Turning to net interest margin and operating expenses. Net interest margin will be approximately 15.55%, up from
approximately 15.50% and incorporates our latest view on the interest rate environment and funding needs.
Operating expenses should continue their quarterly run rate of approximately $1.05 billion, excluding the impact of
the gain on sale reinvestment plans which are detailed in the appendix of our earnings presentation.
To conclude, Synchrony remains very well-positioned to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as the
environment normalizes.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

Brian D. Doubles

network of partners, merchants and providers, Americans financial needs are increasingly powered by the
Synchrony ecosystem.
Our ability to efficiently and dynamically leverage real-time data and deliver optimized financing solutions and
experiences for our customers and partners even as needs evolve and market conditions shift, is what enables
Synchrony to consistently deliver the outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders: utility and value for
our customers, sales and loyalty for our partners and providers, and sustainable growth and consistent risk-

With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.

So Brian, the fourth quarter net charge-off guide implies a little bit of a ramp. Can you maybe just talk about what
is driving that? And then second, you had said in the past that you'd expect to approach more normal levels by
the end of 2023, call it 5.5%, and obviously that implies a decent ramp from here. Can you maybe just talk about
how you see credit progressing in the intermediate term and what does this mean for the allowance? Thanks.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. So again, the guide for the quarter, better than our expectation, to be honest with you, as
we exited out of the third quarter, delinquency [ph] and the loss ones are (00:25:43) a little bit better than our
expectation. And when we look at the attributes inside of the portfolio by credit grade, they're performing still
better than 2019. So, the credit normalization ramp that we see is really on target from what we had projected.
And really view that we'll get back to that mean loss rate as we exit out of 2023, absent a significant change in the
macroeconomic event.
When you think about the fourth quarter, I mean when you look at our 90-day plus past due delinquencies at $1.2
billion, that's going to lead to a rise in charge-off dollars, but not unexpected, and not anything that we look at and
say that we're concerned about, relative to an accelerating credit normalization trend. So, we feel good about
credit. We feel good about the portfolio distribution that we have. And we see migration back to 2019 levels,
including in the non-prime population. So again, we're on target absent a significant change in the
macroeconomic event.
When you then parlay that into reserves, right, when you think about the reserves we have in the books now,
clearly we look at the unemployment rate. When you have credit normalization, that unemployment rate is
projected to be higher in the core model. And then we have overlays for, I would say, more conservative macro
environment. So, we believe that the reserve postings going forward, again should be more growth-driven than
anything else which I think is what you're seeing here in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for the color. And then, the margin is holding up better than expected given the pace of rate hikes.
But Brian, you did reiterate the balance sheet as somewhat liability sensitive. So, can you maybe just talk about
what is assumed in terms of loan and deposit betas? And then, if you look out over the remainder of the rising
rate cycle, where do you see the margin and betas going in a 5% Fed fund scenario just given your balance sheet
positioning? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So if you think about the betas that we've experienced to-date, so if I look at high yield savings, roughly
around 70%. When you think about your 12-month CD rate, when you look at that relative to a swap, it's between
75% and 80%. I would expect, Ryan, to see that tick up a little bit, say, high yield savings around 80% and you
may see 12-month CDs go to around [ph] 1% (00:28:15). Again, I think a lot of it's going to depend upon the
competition in the market and what funding needs people have. We need to remain competitive with both our
digital partners as well as money market funds with regard to that.
So, we continue to be encouraged by the strong franchise. We've been able to grow deposits after a couple of
years of actually shrinking deposits to manage the margins. So, we're encouraged with the franchise and what
we're building there. And I think we've been opportunistic with regard to when we access the wholesale market
and how we really operate inside both the CD and high yield savings. We swung to a liability sensitive, we're a
little bit more this quarter, not materially more, but a little bit more. But I think locking in certificates of deposits for
12 to 16 months is going to set us up nicely for 2023.

Operator: We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Brian, hoping you could kind of talk about, as you think about that credit normalization, obviously
one of the features of your P&L that's somewhat unique is the RSA and how that reflects. And we've had some
kind of puts and takes over the last several years and good performance this quarter. But can you talk a little bit
about how â as that normalizes, how you would expect that RSA to behave over the course of 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Moshe. Again, I think, as we've said, and I know people have been frustrated with it, the RSA is acting as
a design. So when charge-offs kind of troughed out, the RSA peaked. Now, we start to see the charge-off dollars
rising, partially offset by higher interest and fees, but really seeing that flow through the RSA which gave us a sub-
5% RSA for this quarter. And most certainly, we've incorporated that into the guide into the fourth quarter.
Again, I think we'll be back in January to kind of give you that trajectory. There is nothing that we look at, Moshe,
that says, as you move back towards that normalized mean loss rate of 5.5% that we're going to be outside of the
traditional RSA range of 4% to 4.5%. So from a charge-off perspective, it's acting as designed and should go
back. Clearly, I think we're going to have to look at how net interest margin and program performance works, but
again we think, generally, you're going to see the RSA rate trend down as charge offs trend up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Moshe, the only thing I would add there is you also have to remember that that also means that payment rate's
going to moderate and you'll have some top-line benefit as well in interest and fees.

growth rates kind of in your co-brands and dual card portfolios. Maybe could you talk a little bit about whether how
the plan over the next several years â is the plan to grow that? Does that grow faster? How do you think about

we can, achieving risk-adjusted returns. So, I think we've seen really good growth on dual and co-branded cards.
Some of that's new program launches. Some of that is new value props that we have launched and refreshed in
the last year or two. We really like that product. It's a great product to graduate customers into over time.
So if we start them in a private label card with a relatively modest line, once we get comfortable with their
creditworthiness and payment behavior, et cetera, and we get to know them and we get a sense for whether or
not they're willing to spend outside of the brand, then we obviously look at them and upgrade them into a dual
card. So, that's the strategy we've had for years. It works really well both from a risk standpoint as well as a return
standpoint. I don't know, Brian, if you want to...

Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A

The only thing I'd highlight, Brian. You talked quite a bit about the multiproduct approach and having the right
product for our customers. And when you look at our partner basis, whether it's PayPal, Venmo, Verizon,
Walgreens, and some of the other core retailers, TJX, Sam's, that product just fits nicely into the portfolio and we
do it in a line structure very different than our competitors, so it allows us to control the risk in the portfolio and
really optimize the balance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
And frankly, some of our best, most engaged customers are customers who earn rewards outside of the brand,
bring those points back into the brand, and our partners really â they really value that. Those are long-term very
valued customers.

Operator: Please proceed, Mihir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask just about the underwriting
standards in general. Have you tightened â I mean I was just looking at driving the lower new accounts this
quarter, and just trying to understand what could be driving that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, let me go to the latter part. The lower new accounts is really the portfolios sold during the second
quarter. If you look at on a core basis, which strips out those portfolios, we're up 2% and generated again 5.8
million new accounts. From an underwriting standpoint, we have not seen in the portfolio attributes which would
require us to take kind of measures kind of measures across the entire portfolio. That said, Mihir, we always are
making refinements and changes to our underwriting standards. We look at channels, partners and performance.
So, again, we don't see attributes where we need to take a broad-based action, but we are most really taking
some small refinements.
I also want to go back to what's really unique about our underwriting and what we've done over the last several
years is we have not relied upon credit to be the primary driver of growth. So, we haven't changed our
underwriting standards. We haven't gone out like a lot of other issuers to use that and credit lines in order to get
new accounts. We have people coming to us because they're the most loyal customers of our partners, and really
want to engage with the value propositions and the brand.
And because we get so much data from our partners, because we're using unique attributes which we highlighted
in PRISM at our Investor Day. And then you combine that â you combine those attributes and roll them together,
we think we're making actually, hopefully, smarter decisions on risk at the end of the day, and not having to take
more risks. And again, we see nothing that today says we need to tighten across the board. But again, we have
the abilities and the tools to manage that risk appropriately, if we see a change in the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
We try to minimize the ups and downs for our partners as well. So, to Brian's points, when times are really good,
we don't dig a lot deeper and take advantage of that and then put ourselves in a position where we have to pull
13

way back coming out of that. I think that consistency and that discipline is important not just for our own risk and
returns, but obviously for our partners too. So, they're not feeling the ups and downs. So, we try to stay as
consistent as possible.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
And just one final point to that, Mihir, just adding on to Brian's point, if you go back, we provided a chart before. If
you look at the volatility in credit through cycles, we're just generally less volatile because of the way in which our
line structures are in these underwriting standards. And most certainly, you can go back, we shown the chart a
number of different times and it's because the severity and the consistency kind of gives us a competitive
advantage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then, maybe just kind of following along with what you said Brian about being there for your partners,
has that conversation started changing now? And particularly I guess what I'm asking is around competitive
intensity for new partner signups, and are there particular opportunities maybe even with existing partners to grow
products just given the pullback in some of the valuations particularly on the fintech side? Are you seeing some
partners coming back to you saying, hey, maybe you can add this product? Just like â just trying to understand
how those conversations are going and if there's any opportunities in just the competitive environment right now
for partners. Thanks
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure. So, look, I would start by saying it's still a pretty competitive environment out there. I think given what
has happened in some of the fintech space, you've seen a little bit of a pullback there, maybe a little bit less
aggressive in terms of offers and rates, et cetera. But what I'll tell you is that as we're out targeting our partners
and prospects, what's really resonating right now is the multi-product strategy, being able to offer Buy Now Pay
Later, Pay in 4 migrating to other products in our portfolio, because I think one of the things that our partners have
seen is that, depending on the consumer, depending on the product that's being purchased, and frankly
depending on the macroeconomic environment, Pay in 4 gets a lot more expensive in an environment where
rates are rising at the pace that they're rising.
And so, I think partners have taken a step back and now they're trying to rationalize their point of sale, and saying,
hey, look, how do I optimize this for the economy that I'm operating in for my consumer for what they're buying.
And what's great is we can go in and say, look, for this product, we think it's a 12-month, six-month promotional
financing product with an opportunity to upgrade them into a revolving product down the road. That's pretty
powerful. That's pretty powerful, because it gives them optionality and it helps them manage the expense side of
the equation, too, in terms of what those financing offers costs them and what it takes out of their margins. So,
we're seeing really good traction in terms of discussions that we're having out there both with our existing partners
as well as new prospects.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I guess, first question, Brian Wenzel, on your comments related to being liability sensitive,
understandably, might have some headwinds on the NIM. But I'm just trying to think about NII, because you're
yield is, obviously, benefiting from rates, but also higher revolve. Can you just help us parse through that and
think about NII going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Sure. Good morning, Sanjay. So when you think about NIM, if I think about it sequentially for the quarter, we
picked up about 30 basis points of prime benefit in the yields. We also picked up about 4 basis points benefits
relating to merchant discounts. So when you look at the prime impact of 30 basis points, merchant discount of 4
basis points, some of the investment portfolios on the cash position picking up 16 basis points, we largely offset
the interest expense increase, so generally neutral. The important part, though, Sanjay, is when I look at the
prime rate benefit, the effective prime for the quarter was 4.75%. We tend to be a little bit slower the way our
cards bill out and change APRs. So, we have some more room to increase that as we move into the fourth
quarter.
When you think about the merchant discount pricing, we're about 60% to 70% of that price through to our
partners, and that's something that we try to be measured on and deal with competition. So, we think that from a
margin perspective, most certainly, I think in the guide in the fourth quarter we should get those tailwinds kind of
coming through. Again, some of the portfolio will be resetting as you got a full quarter price for some of the CDs
and things like that that we put on in the third quarter as well as the increase in the high yield savings, but we feel
good about it.
Again, I think locking up at these rates, if you believe that the interest rate cycle is going to continue to move up
here in the latter part of the fourth quarter into next year, having those certificate of deposits and being a little bit
liability sensitive right now should benefit us next year as we move forward. Again, we'll be back in January with
probably some more comprehensive thoughts on it, Sanjay, but that's kind of how to think about it. So, we got a
lift when I go back to the revolve rate and late fees going up with delinquencies partially offset by reversals. But
again, the prime rate is flowing through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
You've had the CFPB obviously come in with some comments on regulatory actions potentially for Buy Now Pay
Later. I'm just curious if that's presenting an opportunity for you guys. Do you feel like there might be some
offensive moves you can make? I mean, just broadly speaking. Maybe you could just address that a little bit
more? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. Look, I think we're absolutely playing offense. I do think there has been a little bit of a check-
up in the market now. Partners are thinking about these products and how they want to design their point of sale
for the future. And this is where, again, we think the multi-product strategy wins over the long term. And I'll
comment quickly on just the regulatory environment we think also favors us. I mean, we are heavily regulated
today, as you know. And we would certainly advocate for a level playing field that doesn't exist today. So, I think
to the extent that some of these products around the periphery become more regulated and more scrutinized,
then I think that's a net positive for us.
And so, I think there's a few things that kind of play to our advantage. For the first time in a few years with
valuations where they are, maybe that presents some attractive M&A opportunities if there is something on the
technology side that would be faster to buy than to build. So, that's something that we're always looking at. We've
got a very active M&A screen. I think we're also very disciplined, very focused on valuations. And that was one of
the things that we didn't see over the last couple of years was attractive entry points. But again, that's something
that we run a very active process on and we'll continue to look at, but very disciplined around valuation and
impact to EPS. So...

guys gave us good information about the different platforms, and you talked a little bit about the customers'
different use of the products. But I'm wondering, I mean, just where we are in the cycle, given that we're kind of
moving through an inflationary environment that, I think, is kind of new to all of us.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Is there any kind of behavioral aspects of the customers that are changing that you think changes the value
proposition, thinking about the different uses like dual-purpose versus co-brand versus the NPL? Are you seeing
shifts in that? And does that give you any indications for what to kind of look out for in the intermediate term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Let me start and then Brian may add some commentary. John, when we look at the consumer spending
behavior patterns, we're not seeing very much change? They're being very consistent. They are making choices,
where people are saying, okay, maybe I'm spending a little bit more for grocery or gasoline, and I'm spending a
little bit less on T&E. But we're seeing very much consistency as we think about average transaction values and
frequency consistently throughout the year. And we look at it by credit grade by platform. We look at the world
composition components. So, everything seems to be consistent. So the customer itself is not migrating or
changing their spending behavior patterns.
We continue to see just tremendous positive growth relative to our millennial and Gen Zs. They make about 25%
of our sales. They're our fastest-growing cohort at, call it, 400 to 500 basis points higher than the company
average. So, they continue to view that. Again, the value propositions have to resonate with the customers and
we continue to think that in the multi-product and distribution model that we have. We just think is attractive. So,
we have not seen the consumer from a spending behavior pattern change significantly, again making smarter
decisions, but overall level of spend not really changing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I think what we're starting to see on the merchant side â and I think Brian covered the consumer really well. On
the merchant side, I think you will see â we have started to see and we'll continue to see some adjustment in
terms of what financing offers are presented to the customer, because they are trying to manage in a higher
interest rate environment, their costs. I mentioned that particularly, you get to some of the really short-dated stuff
is â that gets pretty expensive if you're 0% to the consumer and the merchant's paying for all of that. So we have
seen some partners working to rationalize the product offerings inside of their businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. And then, second unrelated question is just, thinking about the RSA next year, Brian,
maybe you can remind us, is the correlation for the â as credit normalizes, is the correlation for the RSA to
delinquencies, provisions or charge-offs? And is there any seasonality or timing differences for us to think about
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. John, we'll be back in January on 2023 as a whole. But I think if you think about the RSA, charge-offs move
immediately through the RSA line, right? So, you're going to see that impact as that normalizes into 2023, that will
provide a benefit to the RSA. The other two components, I think to think about is, reserve postings, growth or
otherwise, flow through the RSA a little bit of a lag. So, that will impact it.
But again, Brian consistently points out rightfully so that as credit normalizes, we would expect to see your
revenue increase and the yield increase on the portfolio. So again, if we don't see the payment rate change,
you're not going to have that normalization. They have to work in concert. So again, I think those are the general
17

gives and takes. I think the other thing will be, how cost of funds really moves, and that flows through as a benefit
to the RSA in a rising rate environment.

Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Growth has been extremely strong, not only for you guys, but also across the industry, as payment
rates have slowed and savings rates have come down. Given what you see out there from a macro perspective
and these declining savings rate, would you expect this growth to slow considerably as we move through the next
few quarters and probably get down to a more normal rate, maybe in the mid-single digits as we get through near
the end of 2023? It just seems like these growth rates obviously aren't able to be sustained for an extended period
of time. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The way I think about it, Kevin is, is you have this period of time where the consumer is working through,
number one, excess liquidity that they have. So that saves rate. Now, we'll carry you through, particularly on some
of the higher spenders, well into 2023. In some of the lower credit quality cohorts and [indiscernible] (00:49:07)
you're seeing wage gains that are offsetting inflation. So, you have some tailwinds with regard to spend and you
see that strong spending behavior pattern.
What we probably anticipate is, as some of that savings drives up, as some of maybe the lack of or the utilization
of lower discretionary spending because people aren't going to the office every day. As that tightens a little bit,
what you're going to see is probably spending come down and payment rate come down. But I think what you're
going to see first is, payment rate begin to slow. Spending stay there, you're going to see balances go up. And
then you're going to see purchase volumes slow. So, I think there could be elongation of asset growth here in the
short term. Again, we'll have to see how the economy and the macroeconomic scenario plays out for a medium
term. But clearly, there are probably more tailwinds than headwinds in the short term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, you addressed it earlier on some â addressed underwriting standards and no changes there,
trying to maintain consistency. You continue to target $2.4 billion, I believe, buyback program. What type of macro
18

conditions or underlying spending trends would you have to see play out before you would start to reconsider,
whether it's underwriting standards or continuing to buy back stock at the level that you're buying it back?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Well, I'll start and ask Brian to comment. Look, I think we are running the business very nimbly right now. We're
ingesting thousands of data points every day on what the consumer is doing, payment trends and behaviors. We
look at it by program, by product, by geography. We're looking for any indicators that say we need to make some
tweaks as we go. And I call them tweaks, because for us this is not an event. It's not one day you're risk on and
the other day you're risk off. It's you kind of take what you're seeing every day and you kind of make changes and
slight modifications as you go. And we feel really good about our ability to do that.
We've invested a lot in our technology platform, our data sources, our tools. And so there isn't one thing that we
look at. But as we're looking at percent of customers that make the min payment, how much above the min
payment are they making, who's gone late for the first time. Those are all little tells and little signs that say, okay,
maybe we go in and we turn the dial a little bit. And so again, we feel really good about our ability to do that.
We're not seeing anything right now that is concerning. It's been a very gradual, I'd call it, normalization.
As we move through the year, in fact, I think every quarter, we updated our credit guidance and it was always
modestly better than what we thought 90 days prior. So, I think we are still in a pretty good operating environment.
We don't see anything that says we got to go in and really ratchet down [ph] credit (00:52:03) and certainly
nothing that says we got to do anything different than what we're doing on the share repurchase side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Brian covered incredibly. Let me just talk a little bit about capital. I think when we look at our business
model, we have tremendous, I think, resiliency in the margin and our capital generation capacity. So I think as we
look out, we look at what's our ability to generate capital. We look at the growth in the RWAs. We look at
preserving the dividend. And then we run our stress test. And again, as we continue to run those quarterly, we
don't see anything even in some of the most severe scenarios that would have us alter or slow down the
repurchase activities and capital plans we have in place, but we do that every quarter. We'll continue to do it. And
as long as we can continue to generate strong returns, we feel good about our capital position and moving
towards our target.
But ultimately, we're going to have to fully develop the capital stack to achieve the target, and that's a little bit
reliant upon the capital markets. But we feel good there. And again, I think when you put the story together, we
really do feel good about the margin in the business when you think about the yield and the losses and then
capital generation capacity.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hi, Rick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I just wanted to talk a little bit about the allowance coverage. Given where we are, both in terms of growth, you
guys are indicating that credit will continue to normalize. We saw an uptick in delinquencies. Economic outlook is
changing. Why do we see the allowance coverage drift down a little bit? And should we expect that to start
heading higher as we move into 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Rick. So when you look at how we have built our reserve models, right, so you look at our baseline
macroeconomic forecast, which, again, we take from Moody's as a starting point, and which shows, call it, an
unemployment rate next year of 4%. When we think about credit normalization, right, and getting back to that
5.5%, as we look at the underwriting cohorts we put on over the last couple of years, that migration back to 5.5%,
the implied unemployment rate in the model is higher than that.
So to think about something that's probably closer to the mid-4s effectively, we don't necessarily put that in, but
effectively shows a higher unemployment rate. We then, on an overlay basis, say, okay, if there is some concern,
what does that scenario look like? So effectively, it gives us a higher reserve coverage as we sit here today than
what you'd normally expect given the delinquency profile if you just looked at it by its own.
So unless there is a significant deterioration beyond that, and we don't see that, then you're really going to be in
growth driven reserves. If we just looked at delinquencies today and ran our quantitative models, it would be
below day one CECL, right? So, we think we're adequately reserved today to encompass what we think is going
to happen in 2023 and moving out. So, we feel good about it.
I think when you look at the delinquencies that we have in here for 3Q, it gives you a pretty good line of sight into
what to expect both fourth quarter and most likely first quarter. So, you can plan that out. And again, absent
something significantly change in the macro environment, we feel pretty good about where the coverage is and
that we're adequately reserved for under various scenarios.

Yeah. It's interesting. I think we're all struggling with the same thing, which is that we have a concern going
forward. But empirically, when we look at the data today, it's hard to sort of connect the dots in terms of that
deterioration. So, we're running the same issues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. But I think you have to look at it â if I just ran the pure quantitative model, I'd just go back to this point
again, you'll be below day one CECL. And it's really the qualitative models and those overlays that is pushing you
higher than day one and in theory allowing it. So if you looked inside our quarter, our quantitative models moved
up and our qualitatives moved down as it kind of got embedded into the core delinquency formation. So, again, I
know we don't provide a lot of ability and people don't provide visibility into all those different models, but they are
working in concert with each other. And that's where we get comfort that we're appropriately provisioned at the
end of the quarter.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Okay. So, two questions. One, I know we talked quite a bit about the net interest margin already. It's down a bit
from the peaks that you had earlier this year. And the exit run rate looks like it's around 15.27%, 15.28%,

somewhere in that range for fourth quarter. And I'm hearing you talk about the migration of the funding mix
looking to go from savings to CDs. And I noticed your CD offer is pretty robust here, 15 months you've got at
3.91%.
So, are you suggesting that with the forward curve where the Fed gets to 4.6% or 4.7%, 4.8%, depending on
which day you look at it, that you lock that in on the yield side? And as that comes through and your funding cost
migrates higher, but is capped relative to what the OSA would do, do you feel like the trajectory here should be
NIMs continuing the path of decline as we move through the year next year? Or do you think that your shift to
CDs can halt that slide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Again, Betsy, we'll be back in January to give you a lot better guidance and visibility into NIM. The way I
would think about it, the pieces that you have moving inside of NIM, again, from the yield side, you're going to
have the slowing payment rate give you better revolve in the short term, higher late fees, partially offset by some
reversals. You're going to see this continued effect of prime move in. We bill almost on a 45-day lag to when
prime changes. So, you're going to see that effect of prime move through the portfolio. We have the ability to
adjust merchant pricing. So, those are the, I call it, tailwinds to NIM.
Again, I do think locking in certificates of deposits at this rate, if you do believe that the Fed is going to continue to
rise into 2023, while it may give you a little bit of pressure in the current quarter or two, is going to be better as
you move throughout the following year. So, it's that shift. Again, a lot of this is going to depend upon what money
market funds do and what other institutions do. We clearly see some customers migrating for yield, but we're
going to remain competitive. The positive news for us, we also see money flowing out of big money center banks
that aren't paying a lot for deposits, which gives us an attractive source. And again â so we're optimistic that we
can manage the funding profile, and we'll be back in January to detail a little bit more.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

And then just a follow-up question on your partner activity and how they're looking to you to help them with their
sales growth as you go into next year, which is expected to be a little bit of a slower paced environment. Can you
give us any sense as to any credit box changes that would come as a result of that or other ways that you can
help drive your partners' revenue growth? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Betsy. Look, I think Brian said it earlier. We really don't try to rely on opening the credit box to drive
sales, that â it typically doesn't end well. So, we try and stay very consistent, disciplined there. What we do work
with our partners on is more around the value proposition and the experience for the customer as well as being
able to offer multiple products. And I think that's really where we're focused. We're having really good discussions
with our partners around how we're going to support them for hopefully a strong holiday, and that is offers, val
prop, it's experience, it's offering new products that are tailored for their customer. I think it's really that entire kind
of ecosystem that we work on with our partners to drive sales for them.
It's a proven model. I think we've only enhanced it with the investments we've made over the last couple of years,
and we're pretty optimistic that we're going to support them in, hopefully, a strong holiday and into a, hopefully,
strong 2023.
