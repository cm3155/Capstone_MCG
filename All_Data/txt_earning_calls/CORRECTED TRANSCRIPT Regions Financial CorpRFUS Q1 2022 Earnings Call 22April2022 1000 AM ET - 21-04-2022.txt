Executive Vice President & Head of Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamaria. Welcome to Regions' first quarter 2022 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high level
commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer
and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover
our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. We're very pleased with
our first quarter results. Early this morning, we reported earnings of $524 million, resulting in earnings per share of
$0.55.
Despite the challenging geopolitical backdrop and elevated inflation, we remain optimistic about 2022. We have a
strong balance sheet positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Business customers, for the most
part, have adapted and are prospering in the new operating environment.
New loan commitments and pipelines remain strong, and utilization rates continue to increase. The consumer
remains healthy. Net population migration inflows in our markets remain robust, and the majority of our footprint
has returned to equal or better than pre-pandemic employment levels.
Asset quality remains strong with virtually all credit related metrics improving in the quarter and net charge-offs
remain below historical levels. The integration of Sabal, EnerBank and Clearsight are progressing as planned and
we're excited about their growing contributions. Additionally, we continue to make investments in talent and
technology to support strategic growth initiatives.
We kicked off 2022 with a strong start and expect to continue building on that momentum. We have a solid
strategic plan, an outstanding team, and a proven track record of successful execution. Now, Dave will provide
you with some select highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 1.5% while ending loans grew 2% during
the quarter. Average business loans increased 3% reflecting broad-based growth in corporate, middle market and
real estate lending across our diversified and specialized portfolios.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
While still below pre-pandemic levels, commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately
43.9% increasing 160 basis points over the prior quarter. Loan production also remained strong. Late quarter
commitments up approximately $1.6 billion.
Average consumer loans declined 1% as increases in mortgage and other consumer were offset by declines in
other categories. Within other consumer, EnerBank loans grew approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter.
Looking forward, we expect full-year 2022 average loan balances to grow 4% to 5% compared to 2021 and
excluding PPP loans and consumer exit portfolios, we expect full-year average loan balances to grow 9% to 10%.
So, let's turn to deposits. Although the pace of deposit growth has slowed, balances continue to increase
seasonally this quarter to new record levels. Average consumer and wealth management deposits increased
compared to the fourth quarter, but corporate deposits remain relatively stable.
We are continuing to analyze our deposit base and pandemic-related deposit increases. Approximately, 35% of
the increase or $15 billion is expected to be more stable with behavior similar to our core consumer deposit book.
This segment is historically quite granular and generally rate insensitive and therefore can be relied upon to
support longer term asset growth through the rate cycle.
The remaining 65% of the deposit increases is a mixture of commercial and other customer types that are
expected to be more rate sensitive or that we are less certain about their long-term behavior. We assume this
segment may have all-in beta of roughly 70%.
This elevated beta assumption includes relationship repricing and some balances shifting from non-interest to
interest-bearing categories. It also reflects a range of $5 billion to $10 billion of balance reduction attributable to
tightening monetary policy. The combination of these segments and our legacy deposit base represents
significant upside for us as rates increase.
So, let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income was stable quarter-over-quarter. Excluding
reduced contributions from PPP. Net interest income grew 2% benefiting from solid loan growth and rising interest
rates.
Net interest income from PPP loans decreased $27 million from the prior quarter and will be less of a contributor
going forward. Approximately 93% of estimated PPP fees have been recognized.
Cash averaged $27 billion during the quarter and when combined with PPP, reduced first quarter's reported
margin by 58 basis points. Our adjusted margin was 3.43%, higher by 9 basis points versus the fourth quarter.
The path where net interest income enters the second quarter was strong momentum from both balance sheet
growth and higher interest rates. Excluding PPP, average loan balances grew 2% in the first quarter, and a similar
amount of growth is expected next quarter.
Roughly $1.5 billion of securities were also added late in the quarter, further benefiting future periods. The recent
runup in rates has certainly validated our decision to wait to deploy into securities. And while not included in our
current outlook, additional securities would provide incremental benefit.
Higher short and long term interest rates provided additional lift to net interest income in the first quarter, and
these benefits are expected to expand in the coming quarters. Total net interest income is projected to increase

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
5% to 7% in the second quarter and is expected to accelerate throughout the year such that the fourth quarter net
interest income is expected to be approximately 15% higher than our first quarter.
Regions' balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates. Over the first 100 basis
points of rate tightening, each 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate is projected to add between $60
million and $80 million over a full 12 month period. This benefit is supported by a large proportion of stable
deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash, which compares favorably to the industry
overall.
Over a longer horizon, a more normal interest rate environment or roughly a 2.5% Fed funds rate will support our
net interest margin goal of approximately 3.75%. While we have purposefully retained leverage to higher interest
rates during a period of lower rates, we will attempt to manage a more normal interest rate risk profile as interest
rate environment normalizes. The Fed's aggressive path for interest rates gives us the opportunity to protect NII at
attractive levels.
We have begun this process by adding $4.7 billion year-to-date of forward starting receive fixed swaps and a $1.5
billion of spot starting securities. This represents approximately 30% of the total hedging amount needed this
cycle.
Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 5% from the prior
quarter, primarily due to reduced HR asset valuations, as well as lower capital markets and card and ATM fees.
Within capital markets, M&A advisory activity was muted by seasonality, as well as the timing of transactions.
Pipelines remain robust, but some deals have been pushed to later in the year. Additionally, debt and the real
estate capital markets were impacted by uncertainty surrounding rates, geopolitical tensions and volatility in credit
spreads. However, we are seeing some stabilization in the loan and fixed income markets and anticipate
conditions will improve in coming quarters.
Further, the reduction in real estate capital markets activity was offset by the addition of Sabal Capital Partners for
the full quarter. Similar to the corporate fixed income market, refinance demand has been softer than expected in
our agency multifamily finance business as investors assess a significant move in interest rates.
We continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of $90 million to $110 million, excluding the
impact of CVA and DVA. While we expect to be near the lower end of the range next quarter, we expect the
activity to pick up in the second half of the year.
Card and ATM fees reflect seasonally lower interchange on both debit and credit cards. In addition, debit card
fees were further impacted by fewer days in the quarter. Mortgage income remained relatively stable and included
approximately $12 million in gains associated with previously repurchased Ginnie Mae loans sold during the
quarter. While mortgage is anticipated to decline relative to 2021, it is still expected to remain a key contributor to
fee revenue.
Wealth management income also remained stable this quarter despite elevated market volatility. Service charges
were also stable during the quarter despite seasonal declines in NSF and overdraft related fees. The first phase
of previously announced NSF and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end of the first quarter, and the
remaining changes will be implemented over the second and third quarters. These changes, when combined with
the previously implemented changes, are expected to result in full year 2022 service charges of approximately
$600 million and full year 2023 service charges of approximately $575 million.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
We expect 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 4.5% to 5.5% compared to the prior year driven primarily by
growth in net interest income. This growth includes the impact of lower PPP-related revenue and the anticipated
impact of NSF and overdraft changes.
So, let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 4% in the quarter driven by
lower salaries and benefits expense and professional and legal fees. Salaries and benefits decreased 5%
primarily due to lower incentive compensation despite higher payroll taxes and 401-K expense. Salaries and
benefits also include the favorable impact of lower HR asset valuations.
Professional and legal fees decreased significantly as elevated fees associated with our bolt-on M&A activity in
the fourth quarter did not repeat. We will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology,
products and people to grow our business. As a result, our core expense base will grow.
We expect 2022 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2021. Importantly, this includes
the full-year impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts. We remain committed to
generating positive operating leverage in 2022.
Overall, credit performance remains strong. Annualized net charge-offs increased 1 basis point to 21 basis points.
Non-performing loans continued to improve during the quarter and remain below pre-pandemic levels at just 37
basis points of total loans.
Our allowance for credit losses decreased 12 basis points to 1.67% of total loans, while the allowance as a
percentage of non-performing loans increased 97 percentage points to 446%. The decline in the allowance
reflects ongoing improvement in asset quality and continued resolution of pandemic issues, partially offset by loan
growth and general economic volatility associated primarily with inflation and geopolitical unrest. The allowance
reduction resulted in a net $36 million benefit to the provision. We expect credit losses to slowly begin to
normalize in the back half of 2022 and currently expect full year net charge-offs to be in the 20 basis points to 30
basis point range.
With respect to capital, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier I ratio modestly lower at an estimated
9.4%. And we expect to maintain it near the midpoint of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range.
So, wrapping up on the next slide, our updated 2022 expectations which we've already addressed. I do want to
point out that these expectations do not include any additional security purchases, so that certainly provides the
opportunity for incremental benefit.
In closing, as John mentioned, we began 2022 with great momentum, and despite geopolitical tensions and
market uncertainty, we remain well positioned for growth as the economic recovery continues.
Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are well-controlled. Credit risk is relatively benign. Capital
and liquidity are solid. And we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets.
With that, we're happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with
Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, John. Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I was hoping maybe you could talk about expectations for deposit growth which came in better than expected.
And particularly as it pertains to the surge deposit. So, maybe just how you're thinking about the trade-off between
keeping some of these deposits and the potential for a higher beta. And I think David you highlighted a potential
for a $5 billion to $10 billion reduction. Can you maybe just clarify how much you expect for these to stick around
and what it means for deposit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So, we had expected the $5 billion to $10 billion of deposits to start flowing out in the first quarter. We have
maintained pretty conservative deposit assumptions. But if you look at the growth and where it came from, it was
in our consumer book.
We continue to grow accounts and continue to have a high level of primacy with our retail customers. And so, our
deposit base is our competitive advantage and it has been that way for a long time. And we're looking to leverage
that as we get into this higher rate environment.
As you think about the surge deposits, we have a third of those that we think are going to be fairly similar to our
legacy deposits in terms of beta, price insensitive. Then we have the other third on the other end, we think are
much higher beta, 80% to 100% beta.
Those are corporate deposits that are – you could characterize those as non-operational deposits that are
probably going to look for a better home or a higher rate. As time goes by, we'll see what happens after this next
rate increase. But we've expected that to either reprice or really flow out of the bank.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
And then, you have in the middle, which is another third, deposits that are stimulus receiving deposits, small
business type deposits. That one's a little harder to predict. We do have a higher beta on it, not as high as the as
the second group.
But any event, if we're wrong on the $5 billion to $10 billion, it's likely that we've maintained our deposits at a
higher level. And over time, if we see that, then that gives us a little more comfort to be able to take some of our
excess cash that we have, some $26 billion sitting on the balance sheet to deploy that into the securities book.
But our guidance that we're giving you does not have that deployed intentionally.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And if we could dig a little bit into the new hedging program. So, David, I don't know if Deron's in the room.
I guess you guys were the masters of adding swaps in a timely manner last cycle and now you've begun this new
program.
So, I think the market is having a little bit of trouble understanding why banks are adding swaps at this part of the
cycle. And I think all of us understand. So, can you maybe just talk about thoughts regarding locking in here,
particularly using forward starters? And I think you talked about another 10 to 12 of additions. Can you maybe just
talk about pacing and why this is the right decision at this point in the cycle for Regions? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I'll go ahead and start. And if Deron is here, I think he can add to it. But you hit on a key word and that is forward
starting. And so, what we're trying to do is get our margin to the optimum level and then layer in protection for that
margin over time.
So, if you look at where we put the first call it $4.7 billion in, that's at a receive fixed rate of 2.32%. Those are
largely going to be effective for 2024. So, we intentionally had them forward starting because we believe there is
risk at that point in the cycle that actually rates could go the other way and we want to be able to protect that. If
wrong and it happens to not reverse and go lower then we haven't lost anything, we haven't given up any of our
net interest income or margin at that point. These are all five-year duration just like they were last cycle.
And so, when you do it forward starting, you can take advantage of pricing. They're not all that expensive to get
into. And we're not giving up our asset sensitivity today. That's important. We are becoming and maintain our
sensitivity and if you – on the comments just a minute ago, the way we're structured in the balance sheet is to
benefit, in particular at the back end such that our NII in the fourth quarter should be up 15% from the first quarter.
And it's just the nature of how our sensitivity is structured at this point in time. Deron, anything you want to add to
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Deron Smithy A
Executive Vice President & Treasurer, Regions Financial Corp.
The only thing I would add is – David said it well – page 8 of the deck just really shows the path of the net interest
margin which really underscores what David is saying. We're going to enjoy nice margin expansion as the Fed is
tightening policy, but we have a very disciplined approach to manage that exposure as rates push higher.

Regions Financial Corp.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
As David said, the probability of a downturn at some point if the Fed has to push higher increases over time. And
so, we want to be cognizant of that. And as we get delivered those higher rates, put in that protection and really
manage the downside risk in those out years.

Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, other banks seem to be spending their rate driven incremental net interest income, or at least some of it,
whereas you kept your 2022 cost guidance unchanged. So, why do you think that is? And with this higher NII
outlook, how confident are you that you can expand on your positive operating leverage this year, next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I'm kind of leveraging the comments just before, the way we structured the balance sheet, our NII, it'll be
growing nicely and throughout the year, but are really strong in the fourth quarter, which sets up a really strong
2023. We're still asset sensitive through that time period. And so, we should have a nice tailwind in terms of
revenue growth.
We pride ourselves on being able to control our cost. We did a good job this quarter. There is that HR valuation
asset that benefited us by $14 million. So, you need to add that back to kind of get us level set. But in any event,
we continue to leverage our continuous improvement program to stay focused on how we get better every day
and how we can leverage technology and process improvement so that we can keep our costs down because we
are taking our savings and reinvesting those savings in things like digital, talent, continuing to hire people so that
we can grow.
We had mentioned that the vast majority of our growth and expenses this year are related to the three
acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of 2021. So, we've had a little bit of inflation we've had to deal
with. And so, we're continuing to work at all levels to try and keep our costs under control and generate positive

operating leverage, which we believe we will have in 2022. We didn't have it this quarter, but we will when you get

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
David, in the slide deck, slide 6, you give us the difference in the net interest margins based upon what's weighing
down your margin today with the PPP loans and the excess cash. Can you share with us on the excess cash
portion? Where do – where does the Fed funds rate need to go? Where you're not going to need to have that
bullet point anymore because it will match your reported margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, it really gets back to the deposit expectations. So, we've maintained this excess cash to be prepared to the
extent the surge deposits do seek other alternatives and we have to pay that out. Obviously, we're getting 100%
beta on the cash while we wait, but being patient has benefited us.
Putting that into the securities book earlier would really cost us and we did put a little bit of that to work this
quarter, $1.5 billion of that at about a 2.80% carry. If we were to do it today, it be even higher. And so, in the 3.5%
range.
So, I think it's important for us to understand what the surge deposit flows are going to do relative to what the Fed
rate movements are going to be. And I think over a fairly short period of time, our cash will get down to our
normalized level, which is $1 billion to $2 billion. And then we won't have to have this disclosure and, of course,
PPP will runoff for the most part, after this year, we won't have to talk about that one either.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, especially talking to you with your background as an accountant. Can you
share with us your thoughts about AOCI? We all understand it's an accounting issue and it's only for the securities
portfolio. Obviously, similar to your peers had a big negative number this quarter, which took down tangible book
value per share and book value per share, again, similar to your peers. So, you're not standing out.

But at what point does it become an issue for banks? And again, I know it doesn't go through your CET1 ratio like
it does for the advanced approach banks. But do we have to ever get concerned about it if it keeps on – the AOIC
keeps on getting larger on the negative side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
So, I'll try to answer this without getting upset. I think the account...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Wait, David, I didn't ask it on CECL. I thought that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, that one's – so you hit on two of their four core accounting standards relative to what we're doing. But in any
event, we have to follow GAAP.
So, OCI does not – the change in OCI relative to securities gains doesn't affect our thinking whatsoever. We
manage the company based on regulatory cap, or capital based on the regulatory rules and for Category IV banks
like Regions and most of our peers. That's excluded from the regulatory calculation.
Importantly, it's also excluded from the rating agencies. So, they carve out the change in OCI relative to
securities, not Importantly, it's also excluded from the rating agency. So they carve out the change in OCI relative
to securities, not pension or other things, but securities they carve out. And what's frustrating about it is that
nobody talks about measuring the fair value of our deposit base, which is where the cash came from to go buy the
securities. And so, we're marking one element of a balance sheet through capital and that's just not how we
manage the company.
And so, it's really irrelevant. It's done because it's easy to do. We can go get a quote, but the fair value of the
deposits in particular for Regions, because of the primacy, because of the granularity, the fair value of our
deposits are shooting through the roof. You just don't see that manifest itself on the balance sheet. You will see it
manifests itself in growing NII and net interest margin. This is the time period we've been waiting for, for rates to
rise. So, the fact that OCI is working against tangible book value, we could care less.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question is a follow-up to Ryan's questioning. The way you wrote out slide 14, it seems like your – that
your NII guide includes both a $5 billion to $10 billion potential [indiscernible] (00:29:08) of deposits and 70%
beta. I guess, I'm asking if I'm reading that correctly. Should it be one or the other? In other words, if they stick
around, it might have a 70% beta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Does that make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. Don't duplicate that. The $5 billion to $10 billion is baked into the $70 billion. So, if we're wrong, our
beta will be lower. Thus far, as I mentioned on Ryan's question, we thought deposits these particular $5 billion to
$10 billion of the deposit would start flowing out in the first quarter. They did not.
We still think that's going to happen. Perhaps it's just delayed a little bit, waiting for the next move, which we
believe is going to be 50 basis points by the way, in May. And we think those, with our largely corporate
nonoperational deposits, are going to seek a higher return than we're willing to pay and they're probably going to
move off the balance sheet in that case. So, this really doesn't – this is not going to be a big deal to us. We've
been planning for it all along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And as we think about your NII guide, David, what type of earning assets growth would we assume? Again,
it goes back to the deposit question right because your outlook has felt very conservative since you first put it out.
But what [ph] interest (00:30:39) asset growth range should we assume lies underneath this NII guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, you have to take the pieces and look at it. So, there's not an appreciable change there. We've got two
things working. One, we ought to have pretty good loan growth as we've mentioned ex-PPP and run-off portfolio,
12


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
that's 9% to 10% growth in the loan balances. But then we've got the $5 billion to $10 billion of deposits going the
other way and so the cash will come down.
So, it's not as much as an earning asset changes. It is mix and what the carry, what the yield is on the net assets
that we – earning assets that we do have. And so, we should see our margin continuing to increase.
We're trying to give you the guide by telling you that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, our NII is 15% higher
than where we are today kind of cutting to the chase because there's a lot of moving parts there.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I wanted to ask about EnerBank. The economic environment has changed quite a bit since you
guys acquired them. And I was wondering, have your views changed at all with regards to the loan outlook from
EnerBank or any consideration, maybe further tightening the underwriting standards given a much higher rate
environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
No, we're very bullish on EnerBank. We're excited about the fact that we closed that in the fourth quarter. If you
look at our growth of EnerBank, this quarter, it was 2%. Obviously, if you annualize that, it's 8%, which is below
the guide that we gave you. And the big driver there is seasonality.
So this first quarter is the low watermark for them. You'll see that pick up. This is a prime book. We're really
excited about the carry that we can get there and the margin. We are ahead of schedule on where we thought we
would be.
And so, Peter, absolutely not. We are looking to that to be a good component of our growth. And again, we feel
good about the credit quality in particular being paid for the risk that we're taking and a nice return for our
shareholders on the capital deployed in that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then if I could just ask about the capital management strategies going forward, just between bolt-on
acquisitions and which have really increased profitability versus buybacks. I saw yesterday, you've got a $2.5
billion buyback. Now, the question is, how aggressive will you be or is it just being opportunistic and just want to
have that authorization in place?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Sure. So, let's go back through how we think about capital deployment. First and foremost, our capital is there for
organic growth. It's to support our business. As I mentioned, ex-PPP and runoff, we got loans growing 9% to 10%.
That's where we want our capital to go first and foremost.
The second is we want to make sure we pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. Our guide is 35% to
45% of earnings in the form of a dividend. So, as earnings grow, so will the dividend. We then think about non-
bank acquisitions and the three we closed in the fourth quarter are great examples. We have a whole team
continuing to look and work with our three business segment leaders on how we can provide products and
services that we don't have to our customers. So, we'll continue to do that.
And then we use share repurchases as the mechanism to maintain capital at the optimum level. And that optimum
level is informed by things like CCAR and how we think about risk in our book. And of course, we just filed our
CCAR submission in April. We'll hear back in the end of June on that.
And yes, we did ask the board and received approval for $2.5 billion share repurchase program over the next
couple of years. The control factor there, Peter, is CET1 that needs to be in the range of 9.25% to 9.75%. That's
what our risk profile tells us. We need to have CET1 in that range. We're targeting the middle of it at 9.5%.
And so, we won't buy shares back if it takes us outside of our operating range. Even if the price were right, which
is where you're going opportunistically, I think that's just to help us manage our capital at the optimum level
because that informs the denominator of our return on capital calculation, which we think is critically important to
our shareholders.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. You did mention earlier about some consideration in your reserves for inflation. And I do want to
ask, you always talk about your average account size being a bit smaller than some of your peers. And I guess
logic would have it that that customer base might be a little more impacted by inflation, by rising energy, gas
prices, and just wondering what you're seeing on some of those call it leading indicators. That would be helpful.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. Hey. This is John. I would just say so far, not a lot of change. Generally speaking, our customer base,
we look at deposit balances, the impact of COVID and relief dollars on customer deposit balances. We saw on
average, even in the lowest balance segment about a 30% increase in – 30% to 40% increase in pre-pandemic
deposit balances. And we are still seeing customers maintaining that level of excess liquidity, as evidenced by the
fact that our deposit balances actually grew quarter-over-quarter.
We do are aware of the impact of inflation or the likely impact of inflation on our customer base. It is a more mass
markets customer base as we've talked about before, about a 60% of our consumer deposit customers are in the
mass market. So, there will be some impact and we're certainly watching for that, but we haven't seen it yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the other side of the loan book in the commercial side, you had a big
drop in non-performing loans, big drop in the criticized assets. Was that anything specific like a couple of
borrowers or sectors or it has been improving for some time, but it has gotten quite low.

John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. I think it's broad based and we continue to see improvement in credit quality across the book, a
reduction in criticized loans, classified loans and non-performing assets. I think it reflects the work that our teams
have continued to do, working with our customers closely to evaluate the risk in our portfolios, to exit certain
relationships, portfolios and businesses where we feel like that we are seeing increased amounts of risk or we're
not getting an appropriate return.
If I had to point to any business where, or businesses, portfolios where we saw improvement, it would be
restaurant, as we continue to work out of that portfolio and hotel as the economy recovers through the pandemic.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey. Hey. Good morning. Hi, everybody. So, just a follow-up on the fee side. Now that you're getting close to the
implementation of your changes to the deposit products and you're continuing to reiterate your service charges,
expectations for 2022 and 2023, service charges are actually probably better than people expected in the first
quarter. So, just wanted to kind of get your updated views on your confidence that you've got the right outlook and
as you start to put the products in place like what are your early takeaways from the continuation of that view?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, our service charge were a little better than anticipated. I will say that we've put in some changes at the
end of the first quarter. You'll see more change coming in the second and third where – so, it's too early to change
our guidance that we gave you last quarter. We reiterated it this quarter, which was $600 million for service
charges in 2022 and $575 million in the next year.
As we go through and see what the impact is for these changes, we'll update that whichever way it might go and
we'll probably have a better feel for the year 2022, next earnings call. But right now, it's prior to early change it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah, understood. Okay. And then one just follow-up on credit, just following up on Matt's question about your
provisioning cost. But can you just talk about, as you talked about normalization of losses starting to happen
towards the back half of the year, what parts of the portfolio are you expecting to see charge-offs increase in first
16

and what areas are you just noticing that potential change in terms of delinquencies and loss rates? Thanks,
David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think that we lowered our range 20 basis points to 30 basis points. As we think about risk going forward
there's certainly the consumer, on the consumer side of the house, there has been a lot of stimulus money. I think
we feel pretty good about the consumer, but that's an area we need to watch closely to see where that starts to
move first.
The second piece of that would be small business. I think small business is an area that probably has on a
relative basis, incremental risk. The issue is we're just not seeing any of that right now. John had mentioned all of
our asset quality indicators are getting better.
We believe our normalized loss rate is as likely to be lower than our history because of our de-risking that we just
mentioned in our whole credit book. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think the leverage book we want to
watch closely as well as we see rates increasing and what kind of pressure might that put on the leveraged
portfolios. So, those would be two or three that we watch.

earlier. Wondering what type of expense flexibility you may have if the revenue backdrop comes in weaker than

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
Well, so, you saw a pretty good quarter this quarter. Again, make sure you add back the $14 million on the HR to
get level set there. The reason we were down is because our revenue was down in certain areas like capital
markets.
That has a tendency to be more variable in terms of the cost relative to the revenue. Things like M&A, if you don't
have M&A transactions then you don't have the compensation that goes with the deal.
So, it depends where the revenue challenges come from, John. If we're seeing it in places like that, then we
should have lower compensation mortgage. If we don't have the mortgage production that we think, then you're
going to see lower compensation for that as well. So, we do have some mechanism to take care of revenue if it's
lower than we thought.
And a big driver of our change in – we've changed, I guess two times now, our revenue outlook has been
because of the rate environment and just more carry there. So, if we have – if we don't get the rate increases that
the forwards imply – implied at March 31, which is what's baked into our guidance, then we're probably going to
have a lower incentive compensation.
So, there are puts and takes there. We still feel confident with the operating leverage number that you just
mentioned. That's exactly what's baked into our guidance and we will – we are committed to having operating
leverage over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks, David. That's helpful. And then on the loans side, as you look at the remainder of the year, in
terms of overall growth drivers, where do you see the strongest loan generation coming out of, both on the
commercial side and the consumer side? What are the biggest drivers of growth over the remainder of this year,
as you look at the economic backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
John, this is John Turner. Our growth in the last quarter and, frankly, over the last, I guess two or three quarters,
has been broad based across all three segments. So, we're experiencing growth in our corporate banking
business, our middle market commercial business and our real estate business.
We're seeing customers access lines of credit at increasing rates to both rebuild inventories and to adjust to
increasing cost associated with inventories. So, obviously increases in line utilization are both inventory and cost
driven.
We're also seeing some CapEx, which I'm excited about across a number of different industries. Customers are
investing in expansion activities. Some of it is for modernization and recognition of a much tighter labor market. In
Alabama, unemployment's 2.9%; in Georgia it's 3.1%; Florida and Tennessee at 3.2%. So, we're at full
employment across some very good markets. And as a result, customers are looking for ways to modernize and
to continue to borrow.
Growth in the portfolio has come in health care, it has come in transportation, it has come in our technology and
defense sectors and asset-based lending. In the real estate business, we've seen some growth in homebuilder as
markets are again continuing to expand as a result of consistent in-migration of people, also seeing some growth
in our real estate investment trust business, which has been an important portfolio for us and a really highly

performing portfolio. So, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to grow through the balance of the year
and we expect that growth to be fairly broad based.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. I had a couple of questions. One is, I just want to make sure I understand how you are positioning yourself
for this surged deposit activity that you outlined on slide 5. I know you put the expected beta of 40% to 60% for
the mid stable, mid beta and 80% to 100% for the least stable, higher beta. Is that your indication to us of what
you think it would take to retain these deposits and would you go after them? Or are you saying, look, we think it
would retain this and we're not going to go after them or it depends on how it progresses? Could you just give us
some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I think if you look at the – if you're on that page 5, let's start with the right hand side. Those are the higher beta,
80% to 100%. I'd characterize those as non-operational corporate deposits. These are deposits that are parked
here that probably are going to seek a better avenue, a better yield than we're willing to pay for. So, you could
expect those to most likely move off the balance sheet first.
When you get to the middle, which is at 40% to 60% beta, those are accounts that has stimulus or small business
accounts with a disproportionate amount of cash in their accounts that we think will normalize over time.
I think you'll see a little bit of both. You'll see some of that move off the balance sheet. You'll see some of that
where we'll pay a higher price. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to monitor that. We have a deposit
rate committee. This is what they do every month, they meet to try to figure out what we should pay.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
As you know, our deposit beta was among the lowest of the peer group. We expect that to be true going forward
because of our granular high primacy deposit base. So, that one has – that middle $13 billion is something we're
going to have to watch closely to see whether it stays on and if it does, what will it cost us?
There is going to be an avenue for both of these that is in the middle column in the right for off-balance sheet
opportunities where we'll move those out of the bank but we'll be able to have a fee associated with that that will
help compensate us a little bit. Won't cover what we're earning today or likely earning as rates move up but
nonetheless it'll be a bit of a carry for us going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then since we're looking for 100 bps up in 2Q, right, in May and June 50 basis points each, we should
start to see some of this surge deposit exit in 2Q shouldn't we or I read that wrong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, I think you're exactly right. I think again when it's 25 basis points that may have been different. 50 basis
points, if you're a large corporation, has non-operational deposits, you're going to be moving pretty quickly. So,
again we expected to $5 billion to $10 billion that we talked about to move off in the first quarter. It did not. Now
our corporate deposits were about flat on an average basis.
We do expect that after this 50 basis points for that to start happening. So, yes, you would expect deposits to be
down in the second quarter as a result of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just two other things. One is what factors will drive you to shift your excess cash to securities?
Are you going to be waiting to get through like 80% of the Fed funds rate hikes to assess and then redeploy, or
are you going to be redeploying along the way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think we've redeployed some. So, we've put $1.5 billion to work this last quarter. As spreads continue to
actually gap out a bit, things like CMBS, Agency CMBS was a good place for us. I guess we put at what 2.80%,
was $1.5 billion. If we were to do that today, it'd be closer to $3.5 billion.
So, it's kind of a little bit of – again, we need to just watch and see what the rate environment will give us. We do
have some cash we can put to work. If our beta assumptions are better, then we'll have that much more cash to
deploy over time.
Now, our guidance we're giving you doesn't have that – does not have that baked into the guidance, but using the
spot securities and the forward starting swaps, all that's baked into our hedging strategy that we're trying to put in
place so that we can protect a really nice margin that we think we can get to over time. And we've given you that
guidance on one of our slides, slide 8. And I think in our prerecorded message, we think we can push up to 3.75%
with a 2.50% Fed fund. So, that'd be quite nice for us.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And last question is just on, you had the AOCI hit. I know it's Gerard spoke about that with you earlier on
the call. The long end of the curve, obviously, is up since March 31. So, should we expect, like, for the dv01 hit in
this quarter would be similar to last quarter for a like dv01 move or are some of these hedging strategies that you
indicated early are changing that and really I'm asking what we need to take into consideration as we think
through to 2Q with this rate back up, what the AOCI hit could be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A

Yeah. So, my first point would be to ignore it and you don't have to do the math [indiscernible] (00:53:54)
something else. But if you want to track it for whatever reason that you have, I would expect it to probably
negatively impact us, but not to the tune of what it did this past quarter, partially because of what we're legging
into right now. And frankly, the change in the long end isn't going to be as we don't think be as severe as it was

Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Following up on your response to both Gerard and Betsy,
I appreciate your comments around how it doesn't make any fundamental economic sense to mark securities to
fair value on the left hand side of your balance sheet without also marking the deposits to fair value on the right
side. And so, fundamentally, available for sale OCI hits are nothing more than accounting noise.
21


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2022
But how would you respond to the idea that in the recession bank stocks are going to trade down the tangible
book value. And so, while it may not matter fundamentally from a practical perspective it's something that
investors tend to care about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. This whole concept of tangible book value came about in the recession. To the extent, we have a recession
the rate environment is actually going to go the other way and securities are going to be worth that much more.
And so, again, I think if you want to mark the entire balance sheet to fair value, that would be reasonable,
especially in trying times where you're trying to figure out what the true fair value of net assets are for a given
company.
But that whole concept to tangible book value, my opinion is really not a going concern issue. It's a failure notion.
It's I'm going out of business, what might I get as a shareholder if we liquidate everything? And the biggest issue I
have with OCI is you're marking one element of the entire balance sheet. Securities, you're not marking loans,
you're not marking deposits or anything else.
So, you're not getting a very good understanding of what true tangible book value is in any rate scenario. And I
realize I'm in the minority and people just do – are going to do what they want. But in a recession, it actually goes
the other way because the rates will be down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. Yeah, that makes sense. You guys have exhibited prowess in protecting your margins through the
hedging program. I guess is there anything that could lead you to ever consider wanting to protect that tangible
book? Or maybe since it is a focus of investors, maybe introducing the tangible book value ex the available for
sale might be something that people focus on because I guess with the passage of time goes [indiscernible]
(00:57:09) would not be realized if you hold the securities to maturity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I – I don't again – we don't use this to manage our bank at all. We don't use it for capital. We don't use for
rating agencies. So, to put it in held to maturity where we don't have to have a mark, all that does is restrict our
ability to manage the portfolio, the way we want. And so, we don't see any need for that.
We do realize there are some people, for whatever reason, that this is important and all I'm saying is go calculate
the fair value of our deposits, which will be in our 10-Q coming up. And just add that in as you're thinking about
tangible book value and then we at least have a better idea of what it is.
