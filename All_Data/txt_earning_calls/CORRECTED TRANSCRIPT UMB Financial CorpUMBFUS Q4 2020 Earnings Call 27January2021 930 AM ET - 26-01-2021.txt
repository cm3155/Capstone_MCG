Now, I'll turn the call over to Mariner Kemper.

Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.
2020 was certainly a year unlike any we've experienced. For banks, we saw the perfect storm. The timing of the
implementation of CECL combined with the economic impact of the pandemic, including 150-basis-point cut in
short-term interest rates and uncharacteristically low long-term interest rates created additional uncertainty and
variability across our industry. Initially, we were hopeful that we would see faster resolution, but almost a year
later the pandemic along with the political and social concerns persist. Despite all this turmoil, the strength of our
diversified business model comes to the forefront as evidence with our strong pre-provision results.
We have posted solid asset growth, helping drive higher net interest income even as the industry data shows
weaker trends in most categories. And our strategy to strengthen and build out our varied sources of fee income
is paying off. Operationally, it's status quo. As our systems continue to perform well and most of our associate
base remains remote.
Even through the extended period of missing much of the face-to-face interaction that is so important to our
business, our teams are working together and producing solid results. I'm extremely proud of how our associates
have adapted during this pandemic. I'll repeat because it's so important, doing what's right to support our
workforce is a top priority. This, in turn, allows us to maintain our customer relationships and our commitment to
high quality underwriting standards and solid capital and liquidity levels. We do see some bright spots heading
into 2021 as our customer sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Modified loan balances have dropped
significantly and our strong credit metrics are holding steady. As you've seen in our press release, we had a great
fourth quarter with net income of $156.3 million or $3.24 per share.
On page 4 in the deck, we've included a highlights table with some key points on several line items. Pre-tax, pre-
provision income was $196.1 million for the fourth quarter. And a quick side note about the metric. While it helps
in comparing industry trends and highlighting earnings power, we don't want to lose sight of the tax advantage we
enjoy because of the composition of our securities portfolio and the strategic use of the municipal securities. Pre-
tax, pre-provision income on a fully tax equivalent basis was $202.9 million showing that tax benefit of $6.8
million.
The biggest driver of our outperformance for the quarter was the $108.8 million gain on our investment and
Tattooed Chef that we discussed last quarter. This investment is a testament to the variety of capabilities that we
have in our capital finance division. And we look forward to partnering with our other clients as opportunities arise
in the future.
Growing fee income including opportunistically adding income sources remains a key part of our strategy. A
couple of competitive advantages we have are our lack of reliance on consumer service charges or on mortgage
gain on sale income where margins have likely peaked in 2020. No one knows for sure how long the refinance
wave will last for the industry. However, we've capitalized on an opportunity we saw to add new customers
through our mortgage platform particularly in our private banking business.
We've shared in prior quarters about our investment in the retail business, which includes ramping up our
mortgage capabilities. We've had a great success in the early stages of our growth, building out our retail and
private wealth offering as evidenced by our 70% increase in average residential mortgage loans from the year-

ago quarter, which are included in our consumer real estate line on the balance sheet. On balance sheet
mortgages contributed 33% of the year-over-year growth in average loans, excluding PPP.
On the expense side, with a few items in the fourth quarter that are not expected to repeat, including
approximately $15 million in operating losses and other expenses from a few unrelated matters, such as litigation,
settlements and some fraud losses. After the initial lull during the early days of the pandemic, we took a proactive
approach in the fourth quarter to opportunistically resolve some outstanding matters that otherwise might have
taken place in future quarters, resulting in favorable and expeditious outcomes. While most of these matters are
typical to our business, the timing and impact of these were outsized in the fourth quarter.
In addition, salary and benefit expense increased from the third quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation
accruals based on company and line of business performance, as well as a $1 million increase in deferred
compensation expense. As we shared in prior quarters, this was offset by a similar increase in income from
company-owned life insurance designed as a hedge to the market fluctuation. Finally, we made $1.2 million an
additional charitable contributions in the fourth quarter. Excluding items that we do not expect to reoccur in the
normal course of business, our quarterly expenses were consistent with prior fourth quarter levels.
On the credit front, nonperforming loans improved from the third quarter to 0.55% of loans. Net charge-offs were
just 4 basis points for the fourth quarter and 13 basis points for the full year of 2020, better than our long-term
averages. I continue to be very proud of our credit performance. In fact, since 2000, annual net charge-offs to
loans have averaged 31 basis points. 2020 was our best year since 2015 when average loan balances were
roughly half of what they are today. The loan risk profile table on slide 27 in the asset quality section shows the
quality of our portfolio and contains the detail on the remaining modified loans by category.
On the following slide, you'll see that we've seen a reduction of 95% in those balances compared to June 30. At
December 31, loan modification balances had dropped to $68 million or 0.5% of loans, down from 9.6% and 4.8%
in the prior two quarters respectively. We took a prudent and conservative approach to our reserve build in the
prior quarters of 2020, and our fourth quarter provision was $5 million reflecting the quality of our loan book, the
nearly $400 million increase in non-PPP loan balances and the reduction in modified loans.
Our quarterly provision represents 2.8 times net charge-offs of just $1.8 million. We believe a negative provision
may be imprudent given the still uncertain operating environment. However, the impact of more stimulus,
improved macro-economic forecasts, and the continued improvement in asset quality within our portfolio may
make it untenable for us to leave our reserve coverage at current levels in the near future.
The modest addition in the fourth quarter brings our total allowance for credit losses on loans to [ph] $216
(00:09:36) million at year-end with an allowance to loan coverage of 1.34%. Excluding PPP loans, that coverage
is 1.45% or nearly 2 times what it was at year-end 2019 prior to the adoption of CECL.
Average loans, excluding PPP balances, increased 11% on a linked quarter annualized basis, led by consumer
real estate, which was boosted by the low interest rate environment and the work we've done to build our
business that I mentioned earlier. Loan production is typically strong in the fourth quarter and that continued in
2020 with new originations of $1.1 billion, outside of PPP balance changes, with pay-off and pay-downs of 30.8%
loans. Looking ahead into the first quarter, we see a solid pipeline that looks to continue this growth. Given what
we know today, and if history is any guide, it's reasonable to expect there are strong momentum and market
opportunities should drive relative outperformance and loan growth and differentiated net interest income growth
in the current low interest rate environment. Commercial line utilization was 29%, returning to its historical levels
after the spike earlier in the year.

Our loan portfolio remains diverse and well-balanced across several product lines, geographies and industries.
The total composition, as shown on slide 21, followed by loan activity during the quarter and breakdowns of our
commercial portfolios by asset class, I'd like to point out that the Minneapolis area, one of our 2019 expansion
markets, now represents 1% of total loans with just over $200 million in balances. We look forward to continued
penetration there.
On slide 25, we updated our exposure to sensitive industries. As you'll see we removed multifamily from this list
based on the operating environment and characteristics of our portfolio at UMB, which is comprised largely of
Class A properties with solid payment trends.
Loans in the remaining five categories totaled $2 billion or 13.4% of loans. However, after our analysis, we feel
that approximately $975 million or 6.6% could possibly carry more risk if the crisis is prolonged. We are closely
monitoring these relationships and have regular communication with these borrowers.
To wrap up, 2020 was a challenging year for everyone, but for UMB it was a testament to our resilience and to
our priorities providing unwavering customer service, caring for our communities and managing consistently in all
operating environments. My sincerest gratitude goes out to all the frontline workers across all the essential
industries, including the UMB bankers that have risen to the occasion and the challenge to deliver the
unparalleled customer experience which we are known for.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for a few additional comments. Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning. As Mariner noted our pre-tax, pre-provision results were impacted this quarter by elevated
expenses due to operational losses, deferred compensation expenses, charitable contributions, timing of certain
invoices, and higher incentive accruals tied to company in line of business results. Those items plus the impact of
two additional salary days drove the 14.6% linked quarter increase in noninterest expense.
Sequentially, net interest income increased 5.6% driven by earning asset growth in both loans and the securities
portfolio along with $6 million from the acceleration of PPP loan fees. Total earning asset yields increased 4 basis
points to 2.95% from the linked quarter due largely to PPP origination fees, which helped drive loan yields to
3.78% for the quarter. Average total deposits increased 3.5% on a linked quarter basis and 22.5% year-over-year
to $25 billion. [ph] DDA (00:13:49) balances grew by $687 million due to the typical year-end buildup of cash in
corporate trust for municipal payments, the ramp-up of public funds and by commercial banking as low rates have
more customers leaving balances in DDA.
The total cost of deposits including free funds was 13 basis points, down from 15 basis points in the third quarter.
Both net interest spread and net interest margin expanded by 5 basis points from the third quarter. Fourth quarter
margin benefited 8 basis points from the acceleration of PPP origination fees and 2 basis points from deposit mix
and rate changes. These were offset by the continued impacts of excess liquidity and lower reinvestment rates on
cash flows from our bond portfolio.
Excluding the benefit of PPP acceleration this quarter, core net interest margin would have compressed
approximately 3 basis points. Looking forward, the actual trajectory of our net interest margin will depend on
multiple factors including short-term and long-term interest rates, prepayment speeds on agency mortgage-
backed securities, excess liquidity in the economy, and the pace of PPP forgiveness.

Given what we know now, we expect some additional margin compression relative to the 2.81% reported net
interest margin in calendar year 2020, roughly in line with the current consensus outlook of 2.70%. Noninterest
income was $228.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $115.3 million of which $108.8 million was the gain on
our Tattooed Chef investment. Because these and other market value adjustments will flow through our income
statement in future quarters, we added a new line item called investment security gains and losses. Included in
that category are also gains or losses on the sale of AFS Securities as well as on some other equity investments
as you'll see called out in our slides.
Trading and investment banking income improved on a year-over-year basis as excess liquidity in the markets
and economic uncertainty has driven more funds into bonds. Additionally, you may recall that we've been building
out our bond sales team over the past few years adding offices in New York and Texas and we're starting to see
those investments pay off.
The tax rate was 18.2% for the quarter and 15.5% for the full year 2020. For 2021, we anticipate it will be
approximately 15% to 17%. We continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total risk-based capital at
14.26%, CET1 ratio at 12.10% and leverage ratio at 8.37%. Tangible common equity to assets was 8.5%. Trends
in our capital ratios are shown on slide 16.
Our tangible book value per share increased more than 20% during the year to $58.64 at December 31. For
comparison our peers that have reported so far have shown a median increase of 8.1%.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of
the call.

Just first, Mariner, if you could just touch upon just a growth outlook, I think, you had one of the better loan growth
performance both for the fourth quarter and full year. Just talk to us in terms of what we heard from other banks
[ph] says (00:18:03) relatively slow first half to half of the year and then some pickup in the back half. Just talk to
us in terms of what your expectations are on loan growth. And also tied to that, as you think what business
development on the fee income side, is there anything in particular that you see exciting from a growth
opportunity standpoint?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thank you, Ebrahim. As I said in my prepared comments and as we have historically done, we've given a
bit of a look into the first quarter which – so on the first quarter basis, we expect to have the same kind of loan
growth via the pipeline that we have had and had in the fourth quarter. As it relates to the remainder of the year,
what I would say is all things remain true that have been true before, which is we're underpenetrated across our
geographic footprint and we're underpenetrated vertically on an asset class basis related to a maturity and getting
our share within the markets that we do business. And then we have, again, deep pipelines, uninterrupted sales
activity, no reason to expect anything different than what we've been able to produce for many, many years
related to the underpenetration and really exceptional sales force.
On the fee income side, there are several things that continue to looking good for us, our trading and underwriting
business both on the public, private side and just pure public side continues to look strong as we built out offices
in Dallas and New York. We expect to continue to see benefit from expanding that business over the last couple
of years.
Corporate trust, one of the most exciting opportunities and yet to be seen yet, but it looks as the way that Biden is
moving pretty quickly, an Infrastructure Bill would be very meaningful to our corporate trusts and public
underwriting business, as we are one of the major players on a national basis in that space. So, we're excited
about seeing that come to fruition. We stand ready to be a pretty major player when that does happen.
Fund services continues to be well-positioned as there's been a lot of consolidation in that business. And with
consolidation, that puts the players that have consolidated kind of on the sideline for a while as potential targets
for business development, wait to see how that plays out. So, our pipeline continues to grow there. We've had a –
year-over-year basis that business has grown nicely.
On the back half of the year, as things progress if the economy continues to go as we all expect it to, we expect to
see our card business, particularly because it's – a lot of it's related to commercial spend, we expect that to
perform when and if that happens. And we agree with the – most other banks have said the back half of the year
that should be the time we would see that.
Our investor solutions business continues to be strong, as we continue to see opportunities with fintechs and our
[ph] wire house (00:21:38) and brokerage business remained strong and with the markets being strong the way
they are, the activity is good there. And we're investing in our wealth management business. We've just invested
in a brand-new reporting and trading system and are doing some hiring there. Pretty excited about that.
And back to the lending front, we also do a two expansion markets, which I noted in the conference call.
Minneapolis now represents 1% of our total loans, and we just expanded into that market just a year ago. So,
prospects for that are pretty great. And we've also moved into Salt Lake City and have high hopes for that.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
That is helpful, Mariner. Thank you. And just, Ram, so you talked about margin pressure? I was wondering if you
could help us just in terms of your thought process around core NII outlook and remind us how much of PPP fees
are left that you expect to accrete as these loans are forgiven. And sorry if I missed it, I joined the call late. Thank
you.

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, what I said, Ebrahim, on the margin was if you exclude the PPP acceleration that we had in the months
of November and December in the fourth quarter, our margin would have been down about 3 basis points on a
core basis excluding PPP acceleration. Now just over half of our PPP fees were recognized in 2020. So, we have,
call it, 45% of those fees from round one of PPPs still remaining to be recognized on our income statement.
And then the core margin, I mean, as I said in my prepared comments, a lot of these will depend on what's
happening with excess liquidity, with more stimulus coming our way and more programs, the industry might be in
for longer periods of excess liquidity, which will obviously impact net interest margin. The other thing is, obviously,
long-term rates as well. Now with the tenure having crept up a little bit, the mortgage rates haven't reacted. So
prepayment speeds and what happens with the reinvestment rates on our mortgage-backed securities book or
totally our bond book will also determine the path of margin. So that's kind of my thought process.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And I would just add that we also do have round two on PPP. So, we have to determine how much more we end
up doing with that as the doors have open for that business. We've been sending applications [ph] for SBA
(00:24:05) starting last week.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Any sense how big that could be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Not yet, but highly likely to be a lot smaller.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And just, Ram, to follow up. I get what you said on the margin. In terms of the core net interest income, do
you think you've bottomed out or do you still see more pressure on the NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
No. Mariner said in his prepared comments the same comments that he said on loan growth in terms of
outperforming – a relative outperformance that's still expected to be true for the net interest income side. So we'll
certainly grow through the current rate environment, which is obviously not very conducive through our balance
sheet growth opportunities. So those comments that Mariner talked about just now also are pertinent to NII.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Ram, maybe start with you on the expenses you called out in the deck. I think you called out some items not
expected to recur and you talked about a little bit in your prepared remarks. I'm interested kind of what you view is
kind of the right jumping off point for 2021 for expenses. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Chris. I mean, we don't give any forward guidance like that, but I'll go back to what Mariner said in his
prepared comments, right? If you exclude some of the noise that we talked about in our script, the fourth quarter
2020 run rate would have been similar to the $202 million or so that we had in the fourth quarter of 2019. And so,
that's a good comparison. So, a lot of the – if we exclude again the noise, I would say, that'd be probably the run
rate that we would jump off from.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And the operational expenses, what exactly is that? Operational loss?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, we were not prepared to kind of get into the nuance of it. But they're expenses that would happen
normally anyway and we took advantage of 2020 to get them behind us and settle things expeditiously in our
favor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And you had the [ph] gain (00:26:27) to do that in this quarter. In terms of kind of use of capital going
forward, I hear you on the organic growth. I'm interested in comments about resuming the buyback, which a lot of
banks have done and also thoughts on M&A. Thanks.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure. These comments, though, I feel a little stale because they're similar to what we've said for a long time.
Obviously, the first place you'd want to use our capital is to build our business. So, that would be through the
investment in people and technology and in M&A, right? M&A, we continue to look. We're spending a lot of energy
and time so that we – which sure like to be able to find something, but – so the energy is being spent there.
As far as buybacks and dividend increases outside of what we've historically demonstrated, that would just
depend on whether we're successful investing – having opportunities to invest in the business first, and then kind
of where our stock is trading and how we're feeling about that related to market dynamics et cetera. So I mean,
the answer, you've obviously seen our history. We have done buybacks. So we're not opposed to them, it's lower
down on the ranking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And just add that. In the fourth quarter, we did buyback about 67,000 shares when our stock was down lower than
where it's trading now. So we will be opportunistic about buybacks and have commenced the resumption or
resumed buybacks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And, Ram, if I could just on the PPP. Do you have the total accelerated fees or the fees in the quarter and
then what's that 45% representing on a dollar basis is going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
We disclosed that the fees, the acceleration part is about $6 million incremental to the fourth quarter and most of
it happened in the month of November and December. Previously, we've disclosed, I think, on a $1.5 billion of
PPP loans based on the size of loans and the number of loans we had. The average revenue that we expected
was about, call it 2.3%. So you kind of can do the math based on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. So 45% of that [ph] less (00:28:49). Okay. Got it. Thanks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
A question on credit, it looks like most of the items improved in the quarter. NPLs were down, charge-offs were
very low, deferrals came down to less than 1%. But I guess the ACL increased a little bit and it looks like those
due to portfolio changes. So I guess, is that just increases in criticized loans? And if so, what portfolios are driving
those increases in criticized?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Nate, I'll take this first. I mean a part of it is the balance sheet growth. So, if you look at a point-to-point basis, our
balances were up about $400 million. So, when you look at our allowance coverage ratio, it actually came down a
couple of basis points. So, that's the primary driver of why we had a reserve build if you will.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And as far as criticized, obviously, you won't see that, please see the 10-Q. There's nothing – nothing will
be unusual there. And really the most important thing to think about when Qs come out is we have very little
migration and are criticized from the first category of watch down the doubtful which has been the same case as
long as I've been around 25 years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. And then just changing gears a little bit and going back to the growth in deposits in 2020.
Just curious if you guys have any updated thoughts just in terms of the stickiness of that deposit growth entering
2021? And what's the plan just from a reinvestment perspective within the securities or just to continue to reinvest
cash flows or do you guys kind of [ph] see yourselves some of (00:30:39) that excess liquidity to work in the bond
book absent where the growth opportunities are across loans?

Nate, I would say all of the above, right. Obviously, we are trying to invest it in the market. Obviously, as you
heard comments from Mariner about the loan pipeline that we see in the first quarter and maybe even into 2021,
obviously, the first choice is to deploy those deposits into loans. So, we'll continue to do that. And then on the
bond portfolio too, subject to all the due diligence that we do on municipal securities and what we buy on the
mortgage-backed side, we continue to see the portfolio grow and then the rest of it is sitting on our balance sheet
of the Fed account basically as excess liquidity. So, it's going to be a combination of those. And I think that will
continue into 2021 just because of, as I mentioned, all the stimulus programs and excess liquidity in the economy.

Mariner Kemper A

And just as far as the stickiness goes, we monitor that pretty closely. I think the diversity of our deposit base really
makes up for any nuance to whether there's excess liquidity on in particular balance sheets whether it be
11

institutional, corporate or within the personnel categories. I think we feel pretty comfortable that the diversity of our
deposit base really cushions us against whatever excess liquidity might be in the system.

Hi. Good morning.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jared.

Just looking at the ACL, you have great info in there in terms of how you've built that out. And about a third of the
ACL is due to sort of macroeconomic conditions. How should we be thinking about that going forward as we're
starting to see some modest improvement there? Are you sort of heavily depending on holding under qualitative
overlays a little bit longer or should we think like maybe second half of the year you'll start reevaluating that
excess and we could see that [ph] really back into the earnings or absorb (00:32:57) fee growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I'll take a first stab at this and [ph] if (00:33:02) the team wants to jump in and help out here, add to as they
can. At the top of the house related to my comments I already made, our thought on that is that the original
purpose of the additional provision that we did in the first quarter of last year was tied to the pandemic. And as far
as I'm concerned, we're still smack in the middle of that. So it's premature to think that we would do some of the
releases that others have announced. We don't think that's prudent. However, related to your question about
when that would change. That would relate to what happens with the vaccine delivery and how quickly everybody
gets it. Whether there's – what the stimulus and all the extra government programs do.
And to your point, whether the back half of the year, we really feel like we're out of this thing or not. What I'd say
about just are sort of the algorithm that is tied to that is complex and it includes things like loan growth, old years
rolling off and whatever performance good or bad was in those years, macroeconomics. I mean, you've got the
whole thing in there. And we have to kind of live by that algorithm. And so, as the news gets better, in a material
way, we'll be hard-pressed not to do some sort of release of provision at some point in the year. But we have to
watch the data and we're going to let the data dictate what we do there and make sure we feel real comfortable
with it.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then on expenses, if we use a sort of [ph] $202 million (00:35:05) as the base for first quarter.
And then, some of the growth you're talking about. I mean, should we really – is this 2021 going to be a year of
good positive operating leverage where we should expect to see some decline in the efficiency ratio, I guess, how
should we be thinking about operating leverage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, improvement for sure. But I think where we come out on operating leverage, there are some
headwinds related to the operating environment, the interest rate environment in particular. And so I think any
meaningful improvement in operating leverage will be hard to get to. I mean we'll be working at it all year long. But
I think the interest rate environment is a pretty – it's a pretty heavy wind for all of us as an industry. So we'll be
working hard at operating leverage, and we may have some nominal improvement in operating leverage, but I
wouldn't expect in this year to see any meaningful improvement in operating leverage.

David J. Long Q

Hey, Ram, the period-ending deposits were well above the average in the quarter. Now, I know there's some
seasonal impact that you have. But looking at the first quarter here, how much of that growth and deposits here
looks like at the end of the quarter is seasonal versus sticky, and how do you expect to defend your NIM if you
have this excess liquidity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
So, yeah, it's really tough to look at our quarter-end deposit balances, particularly as you enter public funds
business. Obviously, we have a lot – as Mariner has talked about, we have a lot of diverse businesses that have
13


UMB Financial Corp.
(UMBF) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2020 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2021
different seasonal aspects associated with it. Obviously, there's growth as well – organic growth that we're seeing
in. And then there's the impact of all the excess liquidity in the economy. So it's really hard to parse it out
especially this year. But the balance sheet was higher because of public fund season, which usually ramps up in
November and goes through the February timeline. So, that happens every year.
And then in the asset servicing or fund services business, there's always some volatility depending on what
clients are doing with cash balances in there as well. But as Mariner said, we feel pretty good that all our lines of
businesses are provider of funds for us. And all the initiatives that we've put in place will help us grow those core
deposits, so they will be pretty sticky from that standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then reinvestment rates in the securities, what are you looking at right now? I think you said that the
roll-off in the quarter was in the 1% – mid-1.80% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's right. And the new mortgage backs and municipal depending on the mix can be anywhere from 1.25% to
1.40%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Okay. And then the second question I had is related to your deferrals, and obviously, real nice to see
those – the numbers come down there. But the current deferrals, if you're still on deferral, have those been
downgraded? And where do they stand in the risk spectrum at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Tom, you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's case by case. Some of those deferrals have been downgraded. And typically those have been
downgraded to a watch. And those would be as you would expect in the hospitality space. Other ones that may
be are on a second deferral. We haven't necessarily downgraded if we're of the opinion that it's totally pandemic-
related. And the belief that once we come out of this and the economy gets back to a more normal state that the
particular borrower gets back into the position they were in prior to that. So, it's case by case is the broad answer.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go
ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Just want to make sure I've got a couple of things written down, right? Ram, the
tax rate guide, is that a GAAP or is that [ph] FTE (00:39:35) guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That's a GAAP tax rate of 15% to 17%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then the – I think you referenced [ph] 2.70% (00:39:46) margin in your prepared remarks. I guess I was
interested, [ph] number one, do I catch (00:39:49) that right and was that a GAAP NIM or is that excluding the
PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
That is on a reported basis, so it's fully taxable equivalent of [ph] 2.70-ish (00:39:57), which is where your models
– your consensus models are at. So that's on a reported basis. That assumes a straight line amortization of the
PPP fees. So to the extent forgiveness accelerates, then you could see some outperformance to that. But that's
just on a steady state normal amortization of the PPP balances.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And that was the kind of – you're [ph] blocking the 2.70% (00:40:26) for the full-year 2021. Is that the right
way to hear you that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Hey, Kay. I might – I'm going to add something here just at the end, like – because nobody asked about this. And
– no? [indiscernible] (00:40:55) I was going to add something real quick, which is just that on the TTCF front,
15

nobody really asked about that. It is a line of business. We do expect to continue to see opportunities and gains in
that line of business. So, anyway, nobody really asked about that. And we don't expect that to be a one-time
opportunity.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kay.
