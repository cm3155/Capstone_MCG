Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our first quarter results. With me as usual are Dave Dykstra,
Dave Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer; Kate Boege, our General Counsel; Tim Crane, President and Rich
Murphy who runs Credit.
The new year means there a new and different format than we had in the past. I will give some general comments
regarding our results, turn over to Tim Crane who's going to discuss the balance sheet. We will then turn over to
Dave Dykstra for more of an analysis of our income statement. And Rich Murphy is going to give us an overview
on credit. Then back to me for some summary comments or thoughts about the future, then we'll have time for
questions.
For the quarter overview, assisted by strong mortgage quarter, good quarter loan growth in line with previous
guidance. PPP loan production leading into excess liquidity utilization and sizable reserve release, we're able to
put up a record quarter, net of $153.1 million or $2.54 per common diluted share, an ROA of 1.38%; so an ROE of
15.8%, [indiscernible] (00:02:36) this quarter.
Our net interest margin is constant at 2.54%. Our net interest income was up $2.5 million from Q4 despite the fact
that we had two fewer days in Q1 from Q4. Right about now, each day is worth approximately $3 million of
earnings. [indiscernible] (00:02:58) was done late in the quarter, so this bodes well for Q2 of this year. Our loan
growth was excellent. PPP loan fee totaled $1.4 billion and helped us to pay down debt forgiveness on PPP loans
one and two, $667 million. We said previously that our strategy was to grow the current low-rate environment
relying on margins to enhance earnings until net interest income could catch up.
We've been successful on both fronts of the asset growth in the quarter, approximately $600 million on Q4 with $7
billion over the first quarter of 2020. There still remains [indiscernible] (00:03:36) to organic growth.
Now I'm going to turn over to Tim Crane who's going to talk about the balance sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ed. With respect to the quarter-end balance sheet, several items worth highlighting. Ed mentioned the
asset growth of just over $600 million. Loans were up $1.1 billion, roughly half related to PPP loan balances. More
importantly, the other half or just over $0.5 billion represents core loan growth. Excluding PPP volumes, this
represents approximately 7.1% annualized loan growth in line with the consistent loan growth target of mid- to
high-single digits on a percentage basis. It's important to note that the loan growth was strongest at the end of the
quarter and that the period-end loan balances were over $500 million higher than the quarterly average loan
balance indicating strong momentum into the second quarter. Some of this detail is on page 8 of the earnings
release presentation.
The growth was spread nicely across all loan categories and pipelines remain strong for all of our major
businesses. We continue to benefit from the addition of clients from the halo effect of our PPP efforts, and we're
starting to see more client activity as the pandemic impacts begin to recede.
Deposit growth for the quarter was $780 million, a majority of the increase in non-interest bearing deposits.
Deposit costs continue to fall primarily as we repriced term deposits. For the quarter, the rate paid on interest-

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
bearing deposits fell 6 basis points to 45 basis points. This is a trend we expect will continue in the coming
quarters.
Like many institutions, we've seen very significant deposit growth and are managing the flows carefully. However,
we view stable low-cost deposits as a strength of our company and will continue to grow those deposits related to
client relationships. Finally, on deposits, we've been opportunistic about securing some low-cost longer-term
funding for the bank.
With respect to the securities portfolio, we remain very liquid. We did deploy some liquidity in the first quarter as
investment securities increased by approximately $1 billion. As discussed on prior calls, we have done this on a
measured basis, mindful of the possibility of rising rates and wary of locking in low long-term yields.
Approximately half the securities were purchased toward the end of the quarter at a rate above 2% as yields
moved up in March from lower levels earlier in the quarter. To get a sense of the timing and the impact of the
securities additions, the period end securities were $743 million higher than the average balance for the quarter.
And had the security has been on the balance sheet for the entire quarter, the margin would have been
approximately 3 basis points higher.
Despite the addition of the billion dollars in securities during the quarter, our duration remains approximately flat
from a year ago and we remain well positioned for rising rates. Lastly, as a result of the strong earnings, both the
Tier 1 capital ratios and the CET1 ratio improved from the prior quarter end and remain appropriate given the
conservative risk profile of the bank.
Overall, from the standpoint of the balance sheet, we are watching deposit flows carefully, particularly those
related to PPP loans. But the main message is continued good growth, which accelerated into the end of the
quarter and will help future periods. Dave?

David Alan Dykstra
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All right. Thanks, Tim. As Ed mentioned, I will cover the notable changes throughout the entire income statement.
And I'll start with net interest income. For the first quarter of 2021 net interest income totaled $261.9 million. That
was an increase of $2.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year and a slight increase of $452,000 as
compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Now, the $2.5 million increase in net interest income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the
earning asset growth and increased PPP fee accretion. And as Ed mentioned, that's despite two less days in the
first quarter, which are worth about $3 million per day, so earning good NII growth.
As far as margin goes, it was unchanged from the prior quarter, as the rate on interest-bearing liabilities declined
7 basis points in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter, which was effectively offsetting the 6-basis-
point decline in the yield on total earning assets. The 6-basis-point decline on the yield on earning assets was
primarily due to an 8-basis-point decline in the loan yields, which were partially offset by a 3-basis-point increase
on the yield on liquidity management assets. The decrease in the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities in the
first quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a 6-basis-point decline in the interest-bearing
deposits through the lower re-pricing of our time deposits and, as Tim mentioned, we expect that to continue. PPP
loan fee accretion increased, as the company recognized $19.2 million of PPP loan fee accretion in the first
quarter, and that compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Additionally, as Tim Crane mentioned, the late quarter deployment of liquidity into investment securities and the
backend-loaded loan growth during the quarter resulted in over $1.2 billion of period-end investment in loan
balances exceeding the aggregate average balances of those categories, which we expect again to favorably
impact net interest income in the second quarter.
The margin is impacted still by excess liquidity in the balance sheet and we'll be cautious about deploying that
and prudent as far as that deployment goes. But there certainly is some upside there if we can deploy additional
overnight liquidity into loans and longer-term investments.
Turning to provision for credit losses, similar to many other banks that have reported this quarter, Wintrust
recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $45.3 million, compared to a positive provision of $1.2 million
and $53 million in the prior and year-ago quarters, respectively. The negative provision was driven by a reduction
in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic forecasts, including
improvements on the Commercial Real Estate Price Index and the Baa Corporate Credit Spreads. Additionally,
the company saw improvement in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter, including decreases in
COVID-19-related loan modifications and improving loan risk grading migration
Slides 13 to 18 of the presentation deck provided on our website provides additional details about the
improvement in non-performing loans, the modified loans, and the macroeconomic forecasts that I've referred to,
and Rich Murphy will cover that in greater detail as far as specific credit quality metrics.
Turning to the non-interest income, non-interest expense, and income tax. In the non-interest income section, our
wealth management revenue increased $2.5 million to a record $29.3 million, compared to $26.8 million in the
fourth quarter of 2020 and was up 13% from the $25.9 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. This revenue
source has been positively impacted by the higher equity valuations, which impacted the portion of the managed
asset accounts, so another great record quarter for our wealth management team.
Mortgage banking was seasonally strong due to the continuing low rate environment and actually increased 31%
or $26.7 million to a record level of $113.5 million in the first quarter from $86.8 million posted in the prior quarter
and was up a very strong 135% from the first quarter of last year. The company originated approximately $2.22
billion of mortgage loans for sale in the first quarter, down slightly from the $2.35 billion in the prior quarter and up
$1 billion from the mortgages that we originated in the first quarter of last year.
The increase in the revenue – in the mortgage revenue for the quarter was resulted from an increase in the value
of the mortgage servicing rights related to fair value assumptions equal to $18 million in the first quarter as
compared to a decrease of $5.2 million in the prior quarter. We also had a slight increase in production revenues.
Production margin expanded 20 basis points. And we had an increase in the value of the capitalization of retained
mortgage servicing rights due primarily to higher valuations on newly originated loans.
The company also retained $322 million of mortgage loan production for investment during the first quarter and
earmarked approximately $160 million of the quarter-end pipeline for future investments. Accordingly, during the
first quarter, the company did not record gain on sale revenue associated with slightly over $480 million worth of
loans retained or designated for future retention. Assuming a gain on sale margin of about 3.5%, plus or minus,
the foregone production revenue for the first quarter would exceed $15 million. But we, of course, will recognize
the benefit of those loans by retaining them on the balance sheet through improved net interest income in future
quarters.

Obviously mortgage production remained very strong during the current quarter due to the high refi activity.
Looking forward, we expect originations in the second quarter to be another very strong quarter. But we do expect
the refinance activity to decline a bit. Somewhat offsetting that anticipated slowdown in the refinance activity will
be an expected pickup in the mortgage volume related to home purchasing activity.
Net, we believe, origination volumes may be down somewhat from the first quarter, but we really need to see how
the purchase market activity materializes. Recently, applications have increased in the purchase markets. We'll
have to see how that plays out.
Table 15 of our first quarter earnings press release provides a detailed compilation of the components of
origination volumes by delivery channel and also the mortgage banking revenue. Turning to other non-interest
income, it totaled $15.7 million in the first quarter, down approximately $4 million from the $19.7 million recorded
in the prior quarter. There are two primary reasons for the decline. One was we had $2.4 million of lower swap fee
revenue and $1.7 million of lower BOLI income primarily related to $1 million less of BOLI investment returns,
supporting deferred compensation benefits and an $800,000 of debt benefits that we had in the prior quarter that
fortunately did not recur this quarter. I should note that the $1 million decrease in the BOLI earnings related to
deferred compensation benefits resulted in a similar offsetting decrease in salaries expense during the quarter.
Going to non-interest expense categories. Non-interest expenses totaled $286.9 million in the first quarter, up
approximately $5 million or 2% from the $281.9 million recorded in the prior quarter. There are a handful of
categories that accounted for the majority of the change from the prior quarter. The first being salaries and
employee benefits which increased $9.7 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. That $9.7 million
increase is comprised of $9 million in commissions and incentive compensation increases, and a $3.2 million in
employee benefit expense increases which was partially offset by a $2.5 million decline in salaries expense
associated with higher deferred salary costs associated with strong loan originations including PPP and the
aforementioned reduction in deferred compensation related to BOLI products. The increase in commissions and
incentive compensation was primarily due to the higher expenses associated with the company's long-term
incentive program and higher commissions related to its wealth and mortgage management businesses. The
increase in employee benefits is primarily related to higher payroll taxes, which tend to be elevated in the first
quarter.
Occupancy expenses totaled $20 million in the fourth (sic) [first] (00:16:15) quarter, increasing only $0.3 million
from the $19.7 million recorded in the prior quarter. Although this increase is nominal, I wanted to note that the
first quarter of 2021 included a $1.4 million impairment charge associated with the planned closure of an
additional branch location compared to a similar $1.4 million impairment charge associated with planned closures
of branch locations that we discussed last quarter.
Advertising and marketing expenses in the fourth (sic) [first] (00:16:48) quarter decreased by $1.3 million when
compared to the prior quarter. The decrease related primarily to a lower level of digital advertising campaigns and
printing costs in the first quarter.
Miscellaneous expenses in the first quarter declined by $5 million. The first quarter of 2021 included a $937,000
reversal of purchase price consideration related to the previous acquisition of mortgage operations. That
compared to $6.6 million of additional expense in the fourth quarter. We don't expect that to have any significant
impact going forward as the time period for those earn-out payments are kind of shortening up and we would
expect that to have very little impact going forward. But there was a big swing from last quarter to this quarter.

And the company also recognized $3.8 million expense related to impairment of certain capitalized software costs
as we evaluated the remaining useful lives of certain software systems that we have been replacing.
Other than expense categories just discussed, no other category had any noteworthy changes from the prior
amounts recorded in the fourth quarter.
If we look at the net overhead ratio for the first quarter, it was down marginally to 0.90% from the 1.12% recorded
in the fourth quarter, and from the full year 2020 net overhead ratio of 1.05%. The first quarter's net overhead ratio
benefited from a strong balance sheet growth and strong mortgage banking results.
Moving on to income tax expense, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.97%, so roughly 26%, which is in
the range that we normally would expect of 26% to 27%.
So with that, I will turn it over to Rich Murphy to give some comments on credit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Dave.
Tim and Dave noted earlier the first quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives. First, from a loan
growth perspective, net of PPP, we saw core loan growth of $515 million or 7.1% on an annualized basis. This
growth was seen across the portfolio, but we saw very solid performances from Wintrust Life Finance, which grew
by $250 million or 18% annualized, and commercial loans, which grew by $175 million or 8% annualized most of
which closed, as Tim pointed out, at the very end of the quarter.
A couple of additional notes on loan growth. Pipelines continue to look very strong. Total core pipeline of C&I and
CRE loans was at $1.4 billion and the highest level we've seen in five months. The core loan momentum that we
have seen has been positively affected by our execution of our PPP program which has been very strong
including this most recent round which I'll address in a moment.
Secondly, the granularity of the portfolio. One of our hallmarks in the credit portfolio has been the diversification
across a number of products. Conceptually, we've always focused on a composition of one-third core commercial
and industrial loans, one-third commercial real estate, one-third from our non-bank niche products. The largest
niche category we have is also our oldest which is premium finance. This includes FIRST Insurance Funding,
which funds commercial insurance premiums and currently totals $4 billion including our Canadian operations.
Wintrust Life Finance, which funds life insurance premiums, currently totals $6 billion. Both of these portfolios
have performed very well during the pandemic. Wintrust Life Finance has grown 17% year-over-year and FIRST
Insurance Funding is up 14% year-over-year. We have also seen solid growth from our leasing, mortgage
warehouse and franchise teams.
Finally, we added a new slide, page 15 of the presentation, which deals with the geographic diversification in our
portfolio. We will always have a Chicago, Milwaukee nexus. However, as this slide illustrates, our various
business lines provide us with meaningful amount of credit outside of our primary markets. From a credit quality
perspective, improvement was evidenced across the portfolio as the economy continues its post-pandemic
growth. This can be seen in a number of ways.
First, non-performing loans were reduced from $127 million at year end to $99 million at quarter end. Even more
striking is a 50% reduction in NPLs from nearly $200 million at June 30, 2020. We recorded $13 million of net
7

charge-offs during the quarter or 17 basis points, which is up slightly from the fourth quarter, but in line with the
previous four quarters.
We also saw a 26% reduction in COVID-19 modified loans from $345 million to $254 million during the quarter, as
outlined on the slide 16 of the presentation. The majority of these remaining modified loans are primarily in our
select high-impact industries, which is detailed on slide 17. Finally, credit risk ratings continue to show a material
positive migration, a trend which has accelerated since the third quarter of last year.
Finally, on PPP, as outlined on page 12, we have now funded over 20,000 PPP loans to over 14,000 different
borrowers totaling $4.8 billion. This includes over 7,700 PPP loans totaling over $1.3 billion during the first
quarter. Our median loan size through the PPP process was around $60,000, and we continue to focus our efforts
on our existing customers, low-to-moderate income areas, non-profits, and identified prospects.
During this most recent round of PPP, we heard from a number of customers that they could use additional help
in the submission process. As a result, we established nine PPP resource centers in LMI areas to assist
customers with the PPP process. This effort has been very successful, and the feedback from the community has
been overwhelmingly positive.
Regarding the PPP forgiveness process, we continue to make good progress as we have now processed
forgiveness applications on over 60% of our 2020 PPP loans compared to 46% for the rest of the industry.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Ed for a wrap-up.

Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thanks, Murph. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet
during this period of low rates and use our structural hedges, the largest of which being our mortgage area.
Compared to the loss in non-interest income, [indiscernible] (00:23:11) balance sheet growth and also the
income/loss due to the lower rates.
PPP loans were expected to [indiscernible] (00:23:19) add to the strategy. All of the above is to be accomplished
while enhancing our asset sensitivity position in anticipation of eventual higher rates. The excellent balance sheet
growth, the asset growth of $7 billion year-over-year and loan growth of $5.3 billion, two of which was organic at
$3.3 million at PPP year-over-year. The experience have – we are experiencing, as Tim laid out, has been done
totally on an organic basis. The acquisition market has been sleeping to-date, but it appears to be opening up a
bit based on our [indiscernible] (00:23:55) we have received lately. As always, we'll take what the market gives us.
We hate dilution, rather it is stupid, but it appears that other people are getting reality again.
On pipelines, as mentioned, we've been strong in all categories. Our asset sensitivity position is close to where
we'd like it to be. We continue to leg in new investment our excess liquidity, taking advantage of market blips
where no less and we totally invested, as lock-ins allows a long-term rates is not our plan.
Credit is remarkably good, as Rich said. Thanks to our consistently conservative credit underwriting standards,
diversified loan portfolio and the work with all of their lending lines and credit folks. NPAs and NPL dollars are
lower than they were at the start of the pandemic. And while [indiscernible] (00:24:47) is delivering strong results
with assets under administration, $0.2 billion in the quarter, $32.1 billion and fees growing $2.5 million in the
quarter. Assets under administration was obviously helped by strong markets. Further strong new account totals
in all distribution channels was related to this growth.

Our treasury area was up $2 million of income, which shows that the halo effect on the PPP has worked very well
for us. We probably have 40% of the – probably 50% halo's in now. So we've got mostly the total deposits and the
loans were coming. So that aids to our pipeline and is doing extremely well with that.
So, the data plan is working. We continue to roll this plan to fulfillment. Organic growth remained strong – I'm
sorry, organic growth should remain strong, taking advantage of if the opening the acquisition market where it
makes sense.
In short, I'm proud of the group. I like where we stand and see the cap growth what the market is giving us to
maintain a laser focus on credit. As always, we assure our best efforts and we appreciate your support.
Now, I'll answer some questions.

think there was a little bit of a hangover from that in the first part of the year. But clearly, we were – as we saw
good pipelines building and we knew that it was coming. But through January and February, we just kind of for
whatever reason, there was a little bit of a hangover for it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Jon, that's been our modus operandi for probably the last eight quarters. We've always build it up at the end of the
quarter and then started again to build it up. I think it's – we think [indiscernible] (00:27:54). I'm not sure, but...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A

Yeah. But...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

But the last eight quarters, we've had that phenomenon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A

Yeah. So, and then as it relates...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I'm just curious if this is all pulling through. I guess, that's the question, because you guys seem a little bit
ahead of your peers in terms of the growth that you put up. So, I guess...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...that's kind of the genesis of the question here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I think that's a broader answer to that. I think that we have seen and you've seen this in really over the
course of the last year, we had always talking of this aspirational nature of being Chicago's bank. And I think over
the last year, through the PPP execution and some of the acquisitions that have gone on in the Chicago market,
namely [indiscernible] (00:28:38) and CIBC, have really kind of seen us become the emerging C&I bank, mid-
market bank.
And we have just seen a lot of new opportunities come over where customers were very frustrated by the inability
of their existing bank to execute on their PPP, to get answers during the pandemic. Maybe they were just kind of
roughed up a little bit during a downturn and they were trying to find maybe a different bank that might look at
their company a little bit differently. There's just a host of reasons that we saw. But the net effect is that we have
10

just really had a much better time being able to get a seat at the table when a company is going out to the market.
And that our ability to execute both on the treasury side and on the credit side, we have been able to pull through
quite a lot of these opportunities.
And finally your question is relates to, do you we see the sort of an uptick in overall levels of funding? I do think,
as the economy start to open up and expand and people start to deploy all that liquidity, and we are seeing
people starting to look for greater credit availability and expanding outline. So I think that as we go through the
balance of the year here, you'll start to see some greater usage. So generally speaking, pretty positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We think we're going to roll out of this pandemic issue as the economy roll out. We're very well prepared for that.
And I think it's somewhat of a reputational issue for us. Reputation is wonderful, and people are looking to us to
help them grow. So there you hit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then – that's helpful. And then kind of the margin calculus, I think the message you're sending to us is
that you have a little bit more room on funding costs and have a bit of a step-up because of the quarter-end
securities purchases, you've got some loan growth. And I guess the question is, with the growth that you're
expecting, are you sending the message that the margin erosion is really over for you and we should see some
margin expansion as the loan growth comes in...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All things considered, yes. But who knows relative to what's going to happen. I mean, if rates go up, we're ready.
We've got that beach ball ready to fly. But if rates go down, we'd still have some signs of vulnerabilities there. But
I think I saw [indiscernible] (00:31:24) national debt is going to double GDP over the next five years. It's just crazy.
With all the cash that's out there, rates have got to go up. Probably what everybody says, it just doesn't work any
other way.
So we're very well-positioned in that regard as we continue to build and deploy. I mean, the plan has always been
to grow through this, through the mortgages and the other means. So as we put out early on in the pandemic,
which we're really well to get us through this.
And as I said, to get the net interest income to make up the difference of margins fall off, we don't know it would
fall off. We are well-positioned to do that. PPP loans were a godsend in terms of additional revenue. But that's just
more we have to make up.

So certainly continue to grow through this, Jon. I think the margins basically in this environment has bottomed out
and has good upside through and we're able to execute and closing the loans, getting good pricing on the loans
and continue to grow through it.
So it won't be perfect. I'm sure we're not going to land on mortgages and the other things fall off and rates go up.
They'll be – they won't be perfect – there won't be a perfect analysis, but won't line up perfectlym I mean. But I
think it'll be – I think we'll get there as long as mortgages can stay high. Do you agree, Dave?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I think that's right. I think we said last time we thought it sort of bottomed out. And we thought we'd put
some liquidity to work and grow through it. As Ed says, the key is to grow through it. And Rich and Ed indicated
why they think it's up as far as our loan growth that's what I agree with. I also think we have a very diversified loan
mix. So I think that that helps us in some areas work when others aren't. But I would think that the thoughts are
that the margin is sort of stable to slightly up in the next quarter. A lot of it depends on how much liquidity applies
on the door. But we've got that $1.2 billion of period-end balances greater than average count. So, that's just has
to help. And we do have some re-pricing assets on the life's premium finance side that those are tied to one-year
LIBORs, but we also have the CD book really re-pricing now. So, those kind of offset the – I do think we've
bottomed out and I think that all things equal that the margin should tick up just a bit.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good. How are you doing? Maybe first question. As we build out our mortgage projections and loan growth,
should we think about, call it, $200 million, $300 million of mortgages staying on the balance sheet. Is that the
right way to think about that? Will that continue? And then what's the earned back on that? Is it roughly a year, if
my memory correct, from the last call that you sacrificed the revenue this quarter, and it takes about a year to
make that up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, on the earn-back, Terry, if you look at our margins being right now 3% to 3.5%, the loans are
yielding sort of, well, 3%, so the general mortgages that we've kept. So, you gave up the upfront gain on sale, and
up 3% you earn it back over a year basically. So, four, five quarters for the earn-back period on loans. But then
they keep – obviously, the loans out there they keep paying dividends going forward. So, it's a little bit of a
sacrifice for the current earnings for future – for future earnings, if we think is prudent. So, we started on 10% or
so. Our retention on the balance sheet are a little bit more. But – so we're down a couple of hundred million in the
– on average in the last couple of quarters. Probably a little less than that, if volumes were down $100 million or
so going forward...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. 8% to 10% number is going to be – we were actually, when we get up to close to $700 million to $800
million, we'll probably pull it back a little bit from interest rate sensitivity standpoint. I would imagine $100 million
would be a number to use going forward, it'd be a good one. The 10% was originally to get going, and a great
deal done though. So, it should help the margin to be up as well long term. And I think, we've got maybe $100
million going forward at least next quarter and we'll judge it after that where the market is, but – and you get to
plan. Yeah?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And there are some – that $100 million is sort of the jumbo loans that we've kept on our books. I mean, we do
have some that we originate for the portfolio that are variable rate, etcetera, that are just normal course of
business. So it may be just slightly more than that. But the extra $100 million is sort of what Ed is referring to as
far as a jumbo, so going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then as a follow-up question, Ed, last quarter at an industry event, you talked about M&A and interest

couple of here's and there's conversations, but nothing really – market has moved away from that and it really
doesn't make any sense right now. We will consider it given the premiums people want to pay.
So, [indiscernible] (00:37:50) we will talk to them, but it appears that that opportunity may have come and gone at
least for now. But we're so willing to do it, if it makes sense, but we're going to continue to fill in here in Chicago
both organically and through acquisitions that you've seen like we just did in the past, if in fact it makes sense. So,
I would discount the – my chumming exercise generally come up with any fish. But we're still available if anybody
wants to talk with.
Our market share in Chicago [indiscernible] (00:38:33) say from Milwaukee, we're going to concentrate on that
and it appears the [indiscernible] (00:38:36) organic growth, we're concentrated on that and we'll do opportunistic
deals as they come along.
Makes sense?

Looking at the expense side of the equation, revenue growth seems to be going pretty well and it isn't usually an
issue with you guys. But looking at the expense side, just curious what type of growth rate we should expect on
your expenses especially in a revenue environment where you still have some headwinds on the net interest

margin? And are there any plans to try to rationalize any expenses given maybe some of the margin pressures?
Just want to get a little bit of color on how you're thinking about operating expense growth here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We always look at various sides of expenses, David, is that constant, [indiscernible] (00:39:43) growth company,
we have to spend money to grow. And, Dave, you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We had some, 10 branch closures and 3 sales of small branches last quarter and then another branch
closure this quarter. So we're constantly looking at that where there might be overlap or underutilization of
facilities. It's kind of an interesting question as far as doing the expense growth because with a mortgage
business as large as ours, as revenues go up and down there, so goes the expenses sometimes.
And so you almost have to look at it ex-mortgages. But ex-mortgages, we would expect the expense growth to
stay relatively contained. And we are looking at the branch network all the time in places where we can save
money. As we had in prior quarters, we have some of these contingent purchase price payments that we had to
expense. As I said on the- my comments, those should be sliding and not material going forward. So that should
help. We're watching our head count and all sorts of things.
So I would think it would stay relatively contained. As you know, though, in the second and third quarters, the
expenses tick up a little bit because of our sponsorships of Major League Baseball and somewhat as in the past
been general all sort of outdoor festivals and community events that we sponsor as a community bank. So, I
expect them to tick up a little bit in the second quarter. But payroll taxes will be less in the second and the third
and the fourth quarter than they were in the first quarter. And there are some other offsets that go either way.
So, I would expect that we can contain the expenses. If we ever look at growth, I would expect them to go up but
not nearly as fast as the revenue side of the equation. So, maintaining the net overhead ratio at the levels that we
think are appropriate. That is what we focus on. And so, but then you've got to spend money to make money. But
we'd expect the revenue growth to be faster than the expense growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
One of the things on the expense [indiscernible] (00:42:11) before the pandemic is we have made a [indiscernible]
(00:42:16) which is our enhancement of our digital products, Dave mentioned this in the last call. We always had
the digital products, but we saw going forward that the overall base that we can build off if we're able to support it
going forward, we took it away from our core processor and now had spent a lot of money. And there's still more
money to be spent on that to make sure that base is correct, and we can [indiscernible] (00:42:45) serve better
products and serve better delivery systems.
We always had great products as we always do have great products with delivery systems as indicated by the
number of [indiscernible] (00:42:59) last year, seven I think a number of more national, and we're proud of that.
But we're going to invest for the future and to have a platform that's going to keep up with, I think we're going to
continue to be a [indiscernible] (00:43:14) acceleration of digital availability and products out there with payment
systems and things like that. We have to be there at the top of our game and although it's kind of the timing is up,
but we'll be there anyhow. And we're half pregnant, we're going to follow through and that's part of it.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
But I think in memory [indiscernible] (00:43:34) was pretty good, probably lowered that number to [ph] 130 to 135
(00:43:41) on a regular basis, and the margin hopefully will come back. In the meantime, the net overhead ratio
has dropped about as much of the margins themselves.
So we're always looking, but it's not linear. That's why the issue is for you guys, it's [indiscernible] (00:44:03). But
it's not linear for you in many ways. I know it's hard, but just how you go up in that overhead ratio and compare
that to where the margin is, where mortgages are and I think you'll come to the right number for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. Right. No, I do appreciate the color and understand as a growth company you do have to spend there. As a
follow-up just, Dave, you mentioned that the mortgage business and needing to just kind of separate that out from
your core. But if you're looking at your mortgage and you say the production revenue comes down by $20 million
in a given quarter, how would that immediately impact the expenses in that same quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I'm not going to give a number of per se because it depends on [indiscernible] (00:45:03), you've got some
production in the pipeline and you've got to close that. So it just – and it also sort of depends on the outlook. If you
really think rates are going up and staying there, and it's not just a seasonal thing, then you've got to adjust. But
we do have contract labor. We do have some overseas contracts out there that are variable. We do have
overtime, and so all those things can go away immediately. And so you will get some benefit immediately. And
then that may take another month or two to let that production work its way through the pipeline before you get
the full benefit.
But we sort of look at – in today's environment, your efficiency ratio in that business may be in the 60% range
because your work going in all cylinders. But if that volume falls, those efficiency and margins come in a little bit,
those efficiency ratios are probably more in the 75% to 80% range. So I think if you think about the mortgage
business sort of between 60% and 80% depending on high volumes and low volumes, that's maybe how to think
of the business.

Hi, Nathan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thinking about the overall balance sheet size going forward, with the PPP forgiveness ongoing, do you guys
expect any downdraft with this excess liquidity that's been building over the last several quarters? Or are you guys
kind of planning to – or playing around these balances pretty much sticking for the foreseeable future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, that's a [indiscernible] (00:47:04) question. It's a – what's going to happen to liquidity [indiscernible]
(00:47:10) stay in the bank. Tim [indiscernible] (00:47:15).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think what clients are telling us, Nathan, is that those balances are going to sort of stick and so they get clarity
on forgiveness which is both at Wintrust and other banks has been slow in coming. But we're getting good core
growth from the halo effect with new clients. But clearly some of that PPP money may be moving out of the bank
as clients get more interested in investing it. But if that happens, it should be followed by loan opportunities for us
as well as that liquidity gets depleted. So, it's a little bit here of bad news/good news story if it happens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah [indiscernible] (00:47:55) we were run off already, Nathan, but doesn't seem to be and as indicated, we're
making it up with the halo effect and the treasury numbers, Tim, do you have the treasury numbers here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, one of the things when we've been asked about the halo effect is how do you know it's real and,
where does it manifest itself, and just looking at gross treasury revenues over the last four months, .we're up 15%,
16% and we know our people are challenged to keep up with the new installations and new additions. So, we're
very encouraged that not only are we getting these deposit balances hopefully on a permanent basis, but that
we're getting treasury business that will often ultimately credit opportunities that will last. So, we feel pretty good
about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Understood. And just changing gears and thinking about provisioning over next quarter or two, I know it's
difficult under a CECL framework to predict, but just given the loan growth outlook still in that mid to high-single-
digit range, how should we think about providing for growth, if at all, over the next quarter or two from a
provisioning standpoint?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
For growth, I think if you kind of move back to [indiscernible] (00:49:11) non-CECL times, where charge-offs were
fairly stable, our provision was probably in the $10 million to $12 million to $15 million range. And I would think in
normal times if the macroeconomic scenarios and credit quality stayed stable, you'd probably be in that $10
million, $12 million range for the normal times. But I can't predict what the macroeconomic scenarios are going to
be. If they continue to improve, then, obviously, the allowance was down a little bit more. But right now, we think
it's appropriate based upon what Moody's has. But we'll just have to see what those macroeconomic forecasts do.
But as far as growth goes, I mean you can sort of look at our allowance-to-loan ratio and apply it to what you think
the net growth is, and that should probably get you pretty close.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. The portfolio appears in and older than April to-date, the upgrade parade has continued, where – when
pandemic started, a lot of downgrades and that enters into the CECL calculation, had a number of upgrades in
the fourth and in the first quarter. Second quarter, we expect that trend to continue. So, if you look at that and you
look at a better macroeconomic environment, you think that we may have another negative provision at the end.
I would always hope that we could have grown through it and not have to play the negative provision game. But
just for the – because it's like a yo-yo, [indiscernible] (00:50:48) up, down where it's going. But I think credit overall
is pretty good. It looks like it's going to be – the environment is getting better.
So, when you think about provisioning going forward, I would tell you, you can have another release, but you
never know. Anything can happen. And really [indiscernible] (00:51:06). And I think as you look at our level of
non-performers and to see a lot of credit quality and understanding the portfolio is actually even getting better, I
think we had to take that into consideration. So, hard to predict with CECL where you're going to end up and, in
fact, in the old days where I could say where we've ended up, but I can't do that anymore, I can't.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. It makes sense. If I could just ask one more on capital. I apologize if it was in the release, I didn't catch it,
but any share repurchases in the quarter and how you guys think about buybacks over the next few quarters this
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, we haven't been doing the buybacks with the stock price increase towards that. So if the stock price
stays in this range, we would not anticipate probably doing the buybacks now we'll use that capital to support the
loan growth and the like, so.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I think, I know the answer to the question, but I'm going to ask anyway. Ed and Dave, the
pace of securities buying obviously yields have popped a bit. We've seen some peers be more aggressive in just
deploying some of this in a positive I missed it. But any sense in terms of magnitude of whether $1 billion is the
right purchase rate a quarter or you would perhaps step it up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It really depends on the rates. I think that we like taking [indiscernible] (00:53:07). I don't want to lock in the lousy
rates. It's really [indiscernible] (00:53:12) rates can – I think rates are going to continue to go up, and we'll take
advantage when they do. I think we've locked in probably after tax $1.5 billion on the deals we've done to-date.
[indiscernible] (00:53:26) assets after tax.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, when the rates popped up at the end of the quarter, the jumbo mortgage banks were yielding over
2%, and we thought that was an appropriate time to jump in. We did a little bit earlier in the quarter to replace run-
off and add a little bit. But rates have kind of fallen back off a little bit, so we're just more being cautious. And that
says, at the lower rates, we probably aren't going to jump in. But if you start to see the jumbos go north of 2%,
again, we may add to some of it more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
So little worried through about what we talked about [indiscernible] (00:54:11) previous questions is, the liquidity
actually stay and kind of have to [indiscernible] (00:54:17) we make has to be tempered by that. We continue to
grow every quarter and – which gives us more ammo to deal with it. We'll deal with [indiscernible] (00:54:31) et
cetera. But we expect this to be opportunistic going forward and not be happy if this is problematic and put it to
work at any way.

And then longer term, your cash is roughly 10% of your earning assets. I mean, where do you think that needs to
be kind of 12 to 24 months out proportionally?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we've always kind of said 85% to 90% loan-to-deposit and liquidity sort of falls out of the equation there. But
I think, if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, we were at 4%. Then we went and loaded up on liquidity, and it
was like 8% because we just didn't know, what the heck was going to happen with the pandemic. So I'd sort of
say, if you were in the 4%, 5% or 6% range, that's probably more normal so to speak, if we can effectively lend
out of that 85% to 90% loan to deposit ratio.

many of the outdoor community events happen that we historically have sponsored. But we would expect the
second and third quarters to increase this year, unlike last year.

Got it. And just going back to the prior question on how you're thinking about security's deployment. It sounds like
that's more cautious given where rates are. You have this avenue open to you in terms of being able to just retain
more on the jumbo resi side. Would you consider taking that up materially above the $700 million a quarter if rates
stay here just to use up some of that liquidity or you're happy where you're at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
How do we consider it? We're actually going to probably drop off a little now. And certainly, we consider rates
went up a bit. We would consider deploying more into that [indiscernible] (00:57:40) that asset class. But I think
we need to kind of wean ourselves a little bit off of that and just monitor liquidity as well as we can [indiscernible]
(00:57:52) where we can and leave some dry powder because I don't think you guys – I just think they're going to
come roaring out of this. You look at where the economy is expected to go, talk to your customers on all the pent-
up demand they have. Supply chains have been so disrupted. And if you look with the government spending,
you've got to have higher rates and maybe not where they should be, but I think you could pick up 40, 50 basis
points on the tenure pretty quickly in which case you'd want to do so I'm guessing there. And your margins have
fall off a little bit, that'll help.

But again, we're trying to land the plane here and have got our margin back off at the same time as our other
income kind of falls off from mortgages and other issues. So, it won't be perfect. [indiscernible] (00:58:51) way
down because of the PPP loan has been wonderful now. But [indiscernible] (00:58:57) because we don't have
them. So we have to clearly go through this and be smart about it, invest when we can and not doing any stupid
just to try to – with a lot of terms just to make up short-term earnings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. And lastly just in terms of the C&I growth that came in at the end of the quarter, I think that's very important.
It was – is that all organic, so to speak, or is some of that from just share shifts from competitors?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Rich?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, it's both. I mean, we continue to win business and take share from our competitors as well as seeing sort of
existing customers grow. So it's – the answer would be both.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks for the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Young with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. But I wanted to just follow up on kind of coming out of the
pandemic here and potentially reopening. Is there any more specific focus on hiring of lenders that we should
expect the ramp of headed into kind of later this year or any new business lines that you would have a renewed
focus on maybe at this point versus maybe where we were last year?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah. I think there are still lenders out there in the marketplace that we have been – last year we brought in a
couple of lenders from some of the acquired banks. We are looking at a couple of new niche opportunities that
are there. And that's really part of our whole story is just trying to find those lenders who really bring a value add
and can really try to continue our diversification of the portfolio. So, I think both of those are pretty important as we
go into the rest of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just bigger picture on – Ed, you kind of – as you said, tried to chum the water on
M&A for the bank side, but didn't really materialize. Are you seeing any good opportunities maybe on the fee
income side that could be a buffer to kind of the mortgage revenue falling off maybe in trust or any new business
lines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well. Yeah. We're always looking. We added a couple last year, Murphy wants to talk about the two new niches
we added?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, probably the one that gets to your question is the money services group, which is – that was a big
business for MB kind of prior to the Fifth Third acquisition, working on the Treasury side with the currency
exchanges in Chicago, also in New York, and really gives us nice opportunity to generate some fee income.
There are not a lot of credit risk. I don't know if you'd add to that [indiscernible] (01:02:17).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, I think we're a couple of quarters into that now with both good success in sort of a nice line of people waiting
to do business with us, there's a little bit of void in the market, but we'll come with it, really nice Treasury-related
revenues that are significant really by any measure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. And we continue to look at a couple of interesting niches in the leasing area and which we think are very
opportunistic and have a really good opportunity for us to kind of expand that book as well. So, I think generally
speaking, we're pretty positive right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
And the wealth management business is kind of tough because as you know in this market everybody thinks
you're the smartest guy in the world and they want a lot of money. And not only that they want to make what
they've made every year and we pay a lot of money for it. It doesn't make a lot of sense to do any of that.
Our organic growth has been great. We have – both institutionally and organically. We picked up I think over
[indiscernible] (01:03:21) close to 1,000 accounts, new accounts in wealth management over the quarter from all
streams, from all aspects of our distribution channels.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
So, I think our name recognition is helping in that regard too. And a lot of [indiscernible] (01:03:43) when people
open their new wealth management account. So truthfully, we were getting much better, too, with the hiring of
some very seasoned salespeople around the country. So I would expect that to continue to grow organically and
we'll go from there. But if you have any [indiscernible] (01:04:04) give us a call. We're all yours.
