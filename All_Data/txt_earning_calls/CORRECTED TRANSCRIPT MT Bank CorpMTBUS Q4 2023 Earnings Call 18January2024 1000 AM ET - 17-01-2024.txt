Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear today on the call, 2023 mark a banner year for
M&T Bank. On slide 3, I want to acknowledge that the keys to our success to what continues to drive performance
remains our purpose, mission and operating principles.
Our focus on making a difference in people's lives and creating a positive impact in the communities we serve is
core to how we operate. It is evident in how we show up for our communities in the moments of need like in
Vermont and Lewiston, Maine, where we continue to help those impacted by tragedies.
It is why we are committed to supporting small businesses that are the backbone of local economies. And it
dictates how our charitable foundation, which celebrated its 30th anniversary last year, continues to uplift our
partners. It is all done alongside our daily work of helping our customers achieve their financial goals.
Turning to slide 4. We're excited to see how deeply we've embedded sustainability across the bank and into our
products and services. I look forward to sharing more information on the impact of our businesses when we
release our 2023 sustainability report in the spring.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Now let's turn to slide 6. As we reflect on 2023, there are several successes to highlight. We continue to realize
the benefits from the People's United franchise and are pleased with the growth in New England with M&T
finishing as top SBA lender in Connecticut.
C&I loans grew by over $5 billion or 11% in 2023, aided by the growth in several specialty businesses brought
over by People's United. This C&I growth outpaced the reduction in CRE as we continue to optimize the way we
serve these customers in the most capital-efficient manner possible. At the end of 2023, CRE loans represented
approximately 25% of total loans.
Our capital remains strong with a CET1 ratio near 11%. We continue to leverage our strong capital and liquidity
levels to grow new customer accounts and relationships. We also reduced asset sensitivity in 2023 while
protecting shareholder capital and value.
However, our work is not done. We continue to recognize the value created by the merger with People's United,
while also bringing more capital efficient, neutral balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue
and earnings over the long-term.
Now let's review the highlights for the full year. Results for the full year 2023 were strong. We generated positive
operating leverage, solid loan growth, improved expense control through the year and growth in EPS and strong
returns. Our pre-tax pre-provision revenue, or PPNR, was $4.2 billion, up 22% from 2022, and we generated
3.9% positive operating leverage.
Net charge-offs were 33 basis points, in line with our expectations and long-term average. GAAP net income was
$2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $15.79, up 37% from the prior year. As a reminder, 2022 results
included merger charges, gain on sale of our insurance business and a sizable contribution to our charitable
foundation, while 2023 included a gain on the sale of the CIT business and the FDIC special assessment.
If you exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $15.72 during 2023, up 11% compared to
2022. Our adjusted returns were also very strong with return on assets of 1.33% and return on common equity of
11%.
Turning to slide 7, which shows the results of the fourth quarter were also strong. PPNR declined modestly from
the linked quarter to just over $1 billion. C&I and consumer loan growth was strong. Expense control was evident
as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the linked quarter and were down each consecutive quarter in 2023.
Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.74 for the fourth quarter. If we exclude the FDIC special
assessment, adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $3.62. On an adjusted basis, M&T's fourth
quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.19% and 9.8%, respectively.
Next, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results. Please turn to
slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down 3% from linked quarter.
This decline was driven by higher interest rates on customer deposit funding and changing deposit mix, partially
offset by higher interest rates on earning assets.
Net interest margin was 3.61%, down 18 basis points from the linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease
to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift contributing a negative 7 basis points, the impact of higher
rates on customer deposit funding, net of the benefit from higher rates on earning assets contributing negative 5
basis points and a negative 6 basis points for carrying additional liquidity on the balance sheet.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Turning to slide 9 to look at the average balance sheet trends. Average investment securities were $27.5 billion,
decreasing modestly during the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits at the Fed increased $3.5 billion
to $30.2 billion, due to our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet. This was mainly funded with
strong deposit growth. Average loans increased slightly to $132.8 billion and average deposits grew $2 billion to
$164.7 billion.
Turning to slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased slightly. Growth in C&I and
consumer loans outpaced declines in CRE and residential mortgage loans. Growth in C&I loans were driven
largely by dealer, fund banking and corporate and institutional businesses.
Loan yields increased 14 basis points to 6.33% with higher yields across all loan categories. Of note, the
consumer loan yield increased 26 basis points as we continue to benefit from higher yields on new originations
compared to yields on runoff balances.
Turning to slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, investment securities and cash,
including cash out at the Fed totaled $56.7 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The duration of the
investment securities portfolio at the end of 2023 was about 3.7 years and the unrealized pre-tax loss and
available-for-sale portfolio was only $251 million.
Turning to slide 12. We continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we're pleased with our growth in
average deposits. Average deposits totaled â€“ grew $2 billion. Approximately three-quarters of that quarterly
growth was from customer deposits.
Average demand deposits declined $3.8 billion, reflecting a continued shift toward higher-yielding products such
as sweeps, money market savings and time deposits.
The mix of average non-interest-bearing deposits was 30% of total deposits compared to 33% sequentially.
Excluding brokered deposits, the non-interest-bearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was 33%. Encouragingly,
we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter.
Continue on slide 13. Non-interest income was $578 million, up 3% sequentially. The increase was largely driven
by a strong quarter for commercial mortgage banking revenues, growth and trust income and a small unrealized
gain on certain equity securities.
Other income also benefited from higher loan syndication fees. The decrease in rates towards the end of the
quarter drove the increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues.
Turning to slide 14. We continue to focus on controlling expenses. Non-interest expenses were $1.45 billion.
Excluding the $197 million FDIC special assessment, non-interest expense were $1.25 billion, down 2% from
linked quarter, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.6%, largely unchanged from the third quarter.
The decrease was driven by reductions in other expenses as the result of losses associated with certain retail
banking activities in the linked quarter and lower merchant discount and credit card fees. The decrease in other
expenses was partially offset by higher professional and other services.
Salary and benefits decreased modestly from the third quarter as the result of lower average head count and
seasonally lower benefit costs, partially offset by higher severance expense.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Next, let's turn to slide 15 for credit. Full year net charge-offs totaled 33 basis points, in line with our long-term
historical average and expectations were set out earlier in 2023. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $148
million or 44 basis points, up 15 basis points over the linked quarter. This quarter's increase was largely driven by
three office-related charge-offs located in New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C., and two C&I charge-offs
related to an online retailer and to an RV dealer.
Non-accrual loans have trended down each consecutive quarter since the first quarter of 2023. That trend
continued in the fourth quarter, with non-accrual loans declining $176 million from linked quarter to $2.2 billion.
The non-accrual ratio declined 15 basis points from the third quarter to 1.62%. The decline was primarily driven
by the transfer of certain loans to accrual, commercial payoffs and charge-offs on loans previously deemed non-
accrual.
Since the end of 2022, we have increased the allowance over $200 million, and the allowance to loan ratio was
13 basis points, ending 2023 at 1.59%. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision of $225 million, compared to
net charge-offs of $148 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $77 million this quarter and increased the
allowance to loan ratio by 4 basis points.
The current quarter build was primarily reflective of the commercial real estate values and higher interest rates
contributing to modest deterioration in the performance of loans to commercial borrowers, as well as loan growth
in the C&I and consumer portfolios.
Turning to slide 16. When we file our Form 10-K in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will
be $12.6 billion, compared to $11.1 billion at the end of September. We completed thorough reviews, covering
more than 60% of all CRE loans, including maturities in the next 12 months, construction loans, watch loans and
all criticized loans.
The increase in criticized CRE loans was tied to these reviews and to 2024 maturities, where the prospect of
continued higher rates could negatively impact performance of the portfolios or create shortfalls in debt service
coverage or require interest reserves for construction loans. Our growth in criticized C&I loans was not tied to any
specific review, but rather completion of an annual review cycle and our ongoing quarterly update upon receipt of
interim financials.
Generally, our reviews do not incorporate any benefit of the forward curve at potentially lower interest rates. The
10 largest downgrades accounted for half of the total C&I downgrades and represented a range of industries.
Common themes include pressures from higher interest rates and labor costs.
During the fourth quarter, criticized non-owner-occupied C&I loans increased $663 million, accounting for 44% of
the total increase in criticized loans. Criticized permanent CRE loans increased $441 million, representing 29% of
the increase and criticized construction loans increased $375 million.
Turn to slide 17 and 18 for more details on the criticized loan portfolio. About 18% of the increase in criticized
loans was driven by health care, 13% by multi-family, and 9% are retail CRE loans. Loan to values remain strong
for these loan types, ranging from low-50% range for retail, mid-50% range for multi-family, and high-50% range
for health care.
To-date, modifications at maturity have had sponsors generally support their loans through replenishment of
reserves, loan paydowns and enhanced recourse. That is why our criticized has not led to growth in non-accruals.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Our conservative underwriting and strong client selection has been supportive of these assets. Reflective of the
financial strength of the portfolio diversification of our CRE borrowers, 96% of criticized accrual loan balances and
53% of non-accruals loans are paying as agreed.
Turn to slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was an estimated 10.98%, compared to 10.95%
at the end of the third quarter. The increase was due in part to continued pause in repurchasing shares, combined
with continued strong capital generation. At the end of December, the negative AOCI impact on CET1 ratio for
available-for-sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 20 basis points.
Now, turning to slide 20 for outlook. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. We see so-called soft landing
scenario as having the highest probability, but the possibility remains for mild recession brought on by lagged
impact of rate hikes from last year.
We are encouraged to be continued strong performance by the consumer as continued job gains as well as wage
growth above inflation helped drive consumer spending. Consumer spending has slowed enough to alleviate
inflation pressure for many goods and services. We expect that to continue in 2024.
Inflation figures remain above the Fed target of 2%, chiefly because of rents and home prices, while the prices of
many consumer goods have fallen and inflation for consumer services has slowed. We expect weakness seen in
rent listings to play through to the official inflation data in 2024, helping to bring the headline inflation figures
down.
Our outlook incorporates the forward curve that has multiple 25 basis point Fed cuts in 2024. With that backdrop,
let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable net interest income to be in the $6.7 billion to $6.8
billion range, and net interest margin in the 3.50s. This outlook reflects the impact of higher deposit funding costs
and the impact of different interest rate scenarios.
As we have discussed, we continue to carry a high level of liquidity. Our current level of HQLA is about $46 billion,
which is two-thirds in the cash and one-third in investment securities. In 2024, we started to shift some cash into
securities. This, combined with other potential hedging actions, can help protect the downside risk for NII from
lower rates, but may reduce NII in 2024.
We expect full year average loan and lease balances to be in the $135 billion to $136 billion range. We expect
growth in C&I and consumer but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages.
Average deposits are expected to be in the $163 billion to $165 billion range. We are focused at growing
customer deposits at a reasonable cost. The level of brokered deposits is expected to decline through the year.
Turning to fees. We expect non-interest income to be in the $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion range. We expect solid fee
income across many business lines. Lower rates will help drive stronger residential and commercial mortgage
banking revenue. Trust income is expected to grow from current levels from higher valuations and increasing
clients.
Turning to expenses. We anticipate non-interest expenses, including intangible amortization to be in the $5.25
billion to $5.3 billion range. This outlook includes our typical first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase,
which is estimated to be $110 million. We also included the outlook to be approximately $53 million for intangible
amortization.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Our business lines are focused on holding their expenses flat while allowing us to continue to invest in the
franchise and our key priorities. These priorities include growing the New England and Long Island markets,
optimizing resources in both expense savings and revenue generation, transferring our systems and processes,
making them more resilient and scalable and continuing to build out our risk management.
Turning to credit. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points due to the ongoing credit
cost normalization in the loan portfolio and resolution of some stress credits. We expect that the taxable
equivalent rate to be 24.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.
Finally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security mark has been a clear
differentiator for M&T. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage
our shareholders' capital very seriously and will return more when it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are
performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day.
While every economic uncertainty is improving, our share repurchase remains on hold. Our decision to resume
share repurchases will consider the results of the 2024 internal and supervisory stress test, including the stress
test capital buffer. Additional clarity on Basel III endgame regulations and continued stabilization in economic
conditions as it relates to the probability of a mild recession.
That said, we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships. Buybacks
have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future.
In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities,
regulators, investors and rating agencies.
On slide 21, there is a summary of three enhancements we made to our financial reporting. First, we reclassified
the substantial majority of owner-occupied loans and related interest income from CRE to C&I loans. This better
aligns with the classification with the underlying management and repayment source of the loans.
Second, in the upcoming 10-K we are changing our operating segments to reflect how management organizes its
businesses to make operating decisions, allocate capital resources and assess performance.
Third, as certain categories have started to contribute more or less to our expense base, we opted to include
printing, postage and supplies and other costs and operations and break out professional and other services as a
distinct line item in the income statement.
To conclude, on slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While the economic uncertainty
remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven
organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders.
We have a long track record of credit outperformance through all economic cycles while growing in the markets
we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth.
Finally, we are disciplined, inquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital. Our integration of People's United
is complete, and we are confident in the ability to realize our potential post-merger.
Now let's open up the call to questions before which Michael will briefly review the instructions.

I'm good Gerard, and you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Can you give us a flavor for when you guys look at the capital structure of M&T as you're putting out, it's
quite strong, and we get beyond Basel III endgame and you see what your new stress capital buffer will
potentially be. What do you see a comfortable level of CET1 on a longer-term basis once those two unknowns are
known and you can factor that into your thinking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I would say it depends, obviously, on the environment that you're in and what whether we're doing a transaction
or not doing a transaction. But you typically would want to operate with a buffer of maybe 50 to 100 basis points
over what's required from the regulations and what we have there would probably be a way to probably peg it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very good. And then based on the experience of M&T, obviously, over a long period of time, you guys put
out in your investor deck that your credit losses generally are below peers. With the increases in your criticized
loans that you've shown today, the C&I and CRE. Do you still feel comfortable that you guys can maintain that
kind of long-term track record of being better than the peers on the credit losses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. Yes. I think it's a long history here at M&T. I mean if you look at it, we have been a disciplined selection on
our client selection, sponsorship and underwriting, and our loss history is really low and kind of shows that.
The future remains uncertain. But if you look at it, it's not a predictor of the past, and we're going to lean in on our
client selection and underwriting approach has really not changed. LTVs are strong, and we have a really good
approach to our underwriting.
Our largest sponsors that we have right now are supporting their credits, they're putting money into credit
refinancing. And many of the charge-offs that we realized in 2023 came from, what I would say, not long-term

clients. They're more financial or institutional type money. But over the long-term, we think that our client selection
will win the day.

Yeah, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just quickly to follow up on that. Is it safe to assume that the criticized loans are more a reflection of market
conditions rather than a change in underwriting standards two or three years ago that have led to these types of
increases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. If you look at where the increases came from, multifamily, it's really more interest rate driven is really what's
driving that. It might have a little bit higher operating cost. But for the most part, their NOI business models are
performing very well. So, eventually, over time, I think that will cure itself and do relatively well.
If you look at construction, construction overall was actually outperforming what's going on out there. There is
stress in some of the take-outs right now. But as rates come down, I think agency take-outs will actually help in
that sector.
On the health care side, right now, it's really more of a reimbursement problem and costs are going up. It takes a
while for them to get better reimbursement costs. So, I think that will help over time. There's a lot of demand in
that sector and I think as costs level off, plus there's an active takeout market through agencies like HUD from
that perspective.
Office, if you look at office, the one advantage we have in office is that we have a really good distribution of
maturities. Over two-thirds of our maturities start in 2026 and beyond. So I think that's a positive. And the other
property types we have like [ph] retail and (00:30:06) hotel are generally stable to improving.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Hi, good morning. Can you talk about the puts and takes on the NII guide? I know you're asset-sensitive with the
buildup in liquidity and the skew to commercial. So, if we get more or fewer rate cuts than what's in the forward
curve, what happens with NII?
And then I think you mentioned your â€“ you started the year, putting some more â€“ or deploying some more of your
cash into securities. Can you talk about what duration you're taking on there and what that would mean for the
asset sensitivity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. So, the guide that we gave at $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, I would say with our three 25 basis point cut would
be at the higher end of that range, stand closer to $6.8 billion, I think, from that perspective.
If rates go maybe 5 cuts or 6 cuts maybe your â€“ or maybe lower end of that range. We've decided that over the
next couple of quarters, we're going to try to move as close as you can to a neutral position. We started to put
some money into securities, and we will continue to do some hedges and interest rate swaps. We're going to
average in over time, we're going to do it all at once and just kind of dollar average in to get it more neutral so that
we can produce stable and predictable earnings over time and not have impact on interest rates.
So I think we feel pretty good about what we're seeing there. And from a deposit beta perspective, I would tell you
that deposit betas maybe or close to peaking from that perspective. Maybe our net interest margin is close to
bottoming out maybe in the next quarter or two. So I feel actually pretty good that we'll be able to start to grow NII
maybe towards the second half of the year and definitely into 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe just a couple of short questions on credit. I mean I think you mentioned that the reviews on
commercial real estate do not bake in the forward curve. So does that mean that if the forward curve plays
through that criticized assets should come down? Or as you scrubbed through the remaining 40% of the book
that, that could put some upward pressure there?
And then I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you give what your updated office reserves were? Because I know you
built some reserves during this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. Yes, let me take your first question first. So, we really don't take into account the forward curve when we go
through the review that we're doing. A lot of the properties, like I said earlier, like multifamily is more rate driven
than anything else. Their business models are intact. So you have good NOI.
I would say, as rates fall, if rates go maybe 100 basis points or more, that could be and probably will be a positive
impact for our credit costs. Now it may not flow in as rates actually materialize and have to come through when
we're doing our next review, but that pressure, I think, would alleviate and probably have an impact on the levels
that you're seeing from that perspective.
From an office perspective, that part of the sector is a little bit different because it also has some structural
challenges. So if you look at that, that's going to probably play out more over time, it's going to be when leases
11

and vacancy rates kind of mature off. We're just blessed to have a longer time from a maturity perspective, which
is great planning from the credit team.
The top risk that we have there are embedded in the ratings and reserves that we have. Valuations that we have,
I think, takes into account the risk. I think we're around 4.4% right now. So I think we feel good at that.
And if you look at â€“ the real teller will be when leases mature and you have resizing risk, what's going to happen
at that point. But we have a lot of time for that to play out.
I would tell you, if you just look at the Signature transaction, there's a lot of money out on the sidelines that will
definitely come in and play and be there. Right now, there's a difference between bid-ask spreads, but there is
money that will come into the market at some point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q

Okay. So did the reserve build come somewhere else in the portfolio because I know you built reserves this
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
We did. I would say reserve builds were mainly driven by the increase in criticized. If you look on our page that we
have in the slide deck, the actual office criticized numbers actually fell. Our increases in criticized were in health
care and multifamily and in hotel and those are really ones driving the increase. That was probably two-thirds of
the increase.
The other third was due to the loan growth that we had, which was C&I and consumer loans. So you can kind of
see that the build wasn't that large for the increases that we had. We just really don't feel we have a lot of loss
component because of the loan-to-value ratios that we have and the collateral that we have on those
transactions.

Just back to the reserve. I know you cited that it did account for current real estate valuations and changes there.
And I know you gave us the LTVs, you cited a few of them. Are they refreshed LTVs? And if not, what type of
valuation declines are you seeing as you work through the office portfolio, specifically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. So when we have done these reviews, I would say we have about 60% of the CRE portfolio. That's been a
very thorough review. Obviously, we're picking the larger ones, the ones that are in larger cities that might have
more risk from a valuation decline. We're seeing probably on average about a 20% decrease in valuations. Our
valuations are probably current within the last year or so. So we feel really good with that. We continue to have
reviews every quarter, and continuing to be very thorough on how we're looking at that. But I think the reserves
we have today, I feel pretty good about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. And one more just on that, if I could, on the criticized scrub that you did. Was that just that?
Was that more of a scrub of the portfolio? It sounds like the way you described it, it was. And if so, do you expect
less of an increase in criticized assets and related reserve build from this level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
John, I would love to tell you that this is the peak of our criticized. We have to finish up what we did. The majority
of our construction loans, we have a little bit more construction loans to do this next quarter. And we're always
subject to getting more information in as we get new financials and new vacancy information and all that.
But I feel pretty good that we did a very thorough review of what we have out there. We really looked in all the
spots that we thought we'd have the most risk and really took that into account. But I can't here tell you today that
we're at the top. But at some point, hopefully, we will be able to say that.

So I guess just on this criticized, non-accrual on credit, in general, given the work you've done â€“ I'm sorry if I
missed this â€“ like, should we expect â€“ so far, the growth in criticized has not reflected in â€“ or been sort of
translated into non-accruals. Should we expect that to change as you see some of your customers feel more
pressure, given just the lagged impact of the rate cycle? Or could we still see non-accruals trend lower? And then,
what drives criticized lower from where we are today? Is it just time and maturity of these loans, or could we see a
pretty decent decline over the coming quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I think the increase that we have today was basically a review of looking at everything that we have out there. And
I would tell you that interest rates probably was the biggest one. Labor cost was probably the next biggest
increase. There was a little bit of increase in C&I as well. And then, C&I, there was nothing idiosyncratic there.
There was a mixture of, if you look at it, the largest 13 credits, seven different industries. So it's pretty diverse
from that perspective. So we feel pretty good overall with where we stand.
Only 6% of our criticized has gone into non-accrual. That's kind of what our historical numbers have been. When
Gerard asked the question, we really feel good about our client selection. We're seeing our sponsors and clients
really stand up and really support these credits. And we think that what we haven't classified is the right direction.
That doesn't mean a few may not flip into non-accrual, but I think, for the most part, we don't really see a large
period of losses. If we did, we would have had to put more in the reserves, and that's not what we're seeing or
projecting.

Got it. And I guess maybe one question on capital. One another regional bank earlier this week talked about the
need for scale for regional banks coming out of what happened last March. You all have been acquisitive from
time to time in a very deliberate way. Just talk to us in terms of, one, appetite to do bank deals as they come
through over the next 12 to 18 months? And secondly, like, do you see the landscape becoming rich with deal
opportunities as we move forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
M&T has always done acquisitions and have grown over the years. Our business model is really to stick to the
regions that we're in and to really meet the needs of those communities, and we like to grow share in those
markets.
So whether you need scale or not, I've been on both sides of that right now and I would tell you that it's not
something you have to have; it's something if it makes sense. I mean when you acquire somebody, you got to
make sure it's a good cultural fit, first and foremost. That is critical. You have to really make sure that if you get
synergies that those come through, both on the expense and revenue side.
So we closed on People's. We're starting to get â€“ got all the cost synergies. We're in the midst of investing now
more into New England and Long Island. So we're going to continue to grow that. It usually takes, I would say,
three to five years to really get the total performance from these acquisitions. So we still have a lot of work to do
from that.
I'm sure down the road, M&T is a favorite acquirer. Somebody might want to sell to us at some point. But right
now, we got a lot of work in front of us and we're focused on really making that. It's one of our top four priorities
right now, and we're going to do that and deliver that.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Daryl, you mentioned the considerations for getting back to the buyback. Is it reasonable to think that maybe the
last trigger or the last consideration is â€“ the stress test is the CCAR? And so, just wondering, is the second half of
2024, do you think, the more likely scenario for restarting repurchases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Frank, I would love to be buying shares back, especially at the level that we're trading at right now, I think, it's a
really good value. Right now, we just want to make sure that we go through the stress test, we find out where our
limits are. We got to make sure there's a lot of uncertainty out there, and we just don't want to go into a recession;
and if we do that, probably would hold back for those purposes.
But we're in the midst of really making a really strong bank. We're really changing it to be less relying on balance
sheet, commercial real estate and really more driven through off-balance sheet products and services, and we're
growing other businesses, both on the balance sheet and in fees, and we're really excited about that.
I promise you we will do share repurchases. Can't tell you when that's going to happen, but it is core to our
strategy, and we will definitely do that when we think it's appropriate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a quick one, if I could, on the deposits, non-interest-bearing balances. Just your thoughts on
â€“ you talked I think about deposit costs beginning to â€“ or beta is beginning to stabilize. Any thoughts on levels of
non-interest-bearing from here? Are you starting to see stabilization in balances around this 30% of total deposit
number? And then as part of that, can you just talk about how trust balances played into the linked quarter
change in non-interest-bearing, if at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. No. Good questions. So we did see through the quarter â€“ in the fourth quarter that our DDA balances were
starting to stabilize. That's one of the biggest components of what's impacting net interest income is that migration
from DDA into sweeps. Hopefully, that will kind of play out in the next quarter or two as that kind of stabilizes.
I think when you look at the retail side of the chain, we still grow our CD book, that will probably continue until
rates really start to fall. We didn't really see growth in CDs till we got over 3%. So we'll probably have to go down
a little bit before that growth probably slows down a bit. But it's important that we price that correctly.
In our disclosures, we combine our retail CDs with our brokered CDs, and I did say in the prepared remarks that
we probably plan to shrink our brokered CDs over time. So that category will probably fall throughout the year, but
it's probably driven more by non-clients.
From a trust perspective, it had a modest impact on it. I would say, it wasn't that big of an impact from that. It was
really just drop in more in the commercial space for the most part.

Operator: And we have our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Daryl, just a few follow-up questions, please. On Manan's line of questioning, I'm wondering, what is your
current assumption for downside beta for the first 100 basis points of cuts? And is there anything about this cycle
where we can't look at historical precedents in terms of volume reaction or cumulative beta reaction to the Fed
easing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So if you look at our betas on a cumulative basis going up, we're now in the low-50% range, but that
includes the brokered piece of that. So if you take that away, we're probably in the mid-40s. And on the downside,
I'd probably say early on, we'll start probably in the 40s on the way down as well.
And as it goes down, though, we won't be able to sustain that because while we increased a lot of our rates
higher in the commercial area and our wealth area and some of our institutional areas. So those will come down
as they went up. So the retail side really did not come down, didn't go up as much, so it won't come down as
much.
So as you go down 100 or 200 basis points, you're actually going to have a declining beta impact is probably what
you're going to see play out depending on how much the Fed actually lowers rates. But I think early on, you're
going to see something similar to that on the way down in the 40s would be my best guess.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And a follow-up question on credit. How should we think about the progression of your ACL ratio from
here? I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you'd already built up your reserve pretty significantly.
As we think about normalization and whatever maturity walls you have in the CRE, should we expect that your
ACL ratios to continue to build from here? I mean this is our first go at CECL with charge-offs actually going up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
All right. I know, it is. We feel really good where our reserve is right now. I can't promise you it's not going to go
up. But we've been â€“ done a very thorough review of all of our, what we think our higher risk type credits in the
CRE space and the commercial space as well. So no promises that it can't go up anymore, but we feel really
good where we are today and where we're reserved.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Daryl. Can you take us inside some of the discussions that you're having with your
commercial clients? And how confident are you that the ingredients are in place for a reacceleration in loan
growth, if indeed, the soft lending scenario plays out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
If you look at what our clients have been saying, for the most part, they've been more on the sidelines and really
been leery of investing in their businesses. I think it's actually â€“ I get kind of excited. If the Fed just lowers rates
just a little bit, I think the markets will get excited and you're going to have some things take off, and there'll be a
lot more investment, which will help the lending side.
I actually will get more excited on the fee side as well. We saw a fair amount of activity just in December with the
move that we had in the yield curve in treasuries, where there was a lot of pent-up demand and we were able to
do some placements in our commercial mortgage area, and you saw that flow through with some fee income.
So I get excited that if the Fed just lowers rates just a little bit, I think we're going to have more momentum come
through than what you're actually seeing maybe in the guide that we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's really helpful. And then following up on Eric's question. On the reserve rate trajectory within CRE. Some
has indicated that in this environment, they'd be more likely to maintain reserve rates in office CRE as charge-offs
occur. Is it reasonable to expect that there would be a lag between when we see peak losses in CRE and when
you actually start to release reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
We go through the analysis. I mean it's a model, right, and it's based on our variables. So if you look at the
variables we had this past quarter, the variables for like GDP and unemployment were basically unchanged. And
they actually got a little bit better on CREPI and on HPI. So that actually helped in the reserve calculation. So
we're using the macro variables coupled with how we think that the credits are rated from a credit perspective and
it all comes together.
From a timing perspective, I think it's hard to say exactly when reserves will get adjusted. Right now, we feel good
with what we have given our risk is that we know right now on the credit side. But over time, probably, there will
be some reserves, but it releases by. You just don't know when that's going to happen. It's more model-driven.

Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, guys. So one question going back to this beta on the way down that I sometimes get from investors and I
never have a very good answer. And you guys historically been pretty good about thinking about normalized
margins and drivers. So hopefully, you can do better than me.
We all talk about deposit costs as the problem. But if I think about deposit margins over time, and I know there's
different ways to measure them, but relative to Fed funds, the spread between deposits and Fed funds is basically
at an all-time high for you and the industry.
It's a little less extreme relative to two and five-year treasuries, but it's still elevated or even just more
simplistically, like your deposit costs today are still a little bit lower than they were the last time the Fed was here.
So I know a lot has changed over time, but just have you thought about that? Does it make sense that deposit
margins or liability margins more broadly are kind of higher than they have been historically and where on your
worry list is the idea that because they're pretty high to start with, maybe as the Fed cuts, betas aren't 40% or
50% there, 20% or 30%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. I would say, and I think it was Erika's question where when I was saying as rates fall, the beta will start to
come down just because the consumer side did not go up as much. So I think we'll start off at a higher pace. But
as that comes down, that will be less from that.
If you look at it, I actually like the level of interest rates where we are today. I mean, we're in the low-5s is where
the Fed is. If we stay, let's say, in the 4% range or maybe even as low as 3%. As long as we price our assets and
deposits appropriately, to getting back to basic business and we get good spreads on that, there is no reason we
can have very healthy net interest margins for a very long period of time.
It's all about pricing your assets and deposits correctly and making sure you're putting prepayment language in on
your fixed loans and making sure you're pricing deposits appropriately. But it's a great environment for banking
and margins. I feel really good from that.
Would we trend higher than where we are today, probably over time, but it really comes down to discipline. You
really work on the asset mix change at that time. In times like that, when rates tend to be in that time period,
19

economy seems to be going pretty well. So you probably have good loan growth out there and pretty decent
deposit growth.
So I actually get excited once rates come down a little bit, and we can really operate the bank. Historically, I think
we'll have good, really good returns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And maybe as a follow-up, your predecessor has the theme of kicking off this whole deposit and margin worry
cycle at the Barclays Conference a couple of years ago. I think at that time, the original message was the NIM
was 4% or 4.1%. And through the cycle, you thought 3.6% to 3.9% was a normalized range. Is that still the
thinking like we'll be at 3.5% or so in 2024, but normalized at some point in the future is 3.6% to 3.9%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I think that's pretty much spot on, Brian. I would say. Darren did a great job in this role, and he also called exactly
what our charge-offs were going to be in the beginning of the year, and they came in pretty much spot on. So he
did a great job in this role.
But when I look at it and see what's happening, if I call it right, maybe we bottom in the next quarter or two in net
interest margin then we can start growing from there. So I'm pretty much in that camp as well.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Maybe to start â€“ to actually start where you just ended. So that normalized NIM range, 3.6% to 3.9%. If we think
about your commentary right, you want to move the balance sheet to a more neutral position. Is there any reason
in whatever a normal curve looks like, we haven't seen one in a while, that you couldn't move to the upper end of
that range? I think most would be disappointed if you were 3.6%, like why wouldn't you move to the very upper
end of that range?

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I [ph] don't think I'll (00:57:26) hear about it, but just talking about 2025, 2026. Like, is there a reason that you're
not going to be 3.75% margin bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I feel really good at the way we are positioned. What makes us so strong is we are really good at how we price
our assets. But what really makes it is that we are great at growing operating accounts. And that funding source is
really starting to come back on and growing nicely. So we always have and probably will have a top quartile net
interest margin. So I feel really good about that.
We may operate a little bit lower just because we're going to carry a little bit more liquidity. Right now, we're
carrying about $4 billion more liquidity just because we increased our internal stress liquidity scenarios, based
upon some of the learnings that we had from earlier in the year from that perspective. So that cost us 6 basis
points this quarter. It doesn't really impact NII a whole lot, but it impacts your margin just because you're in the
same water on assets and liabilities that don't make anything.
But I feel really good in this rate environment, managing the balance sheet and doing the right thing for customers
and for our communities is really what banking is all about, and I think we'll be able to execute and perform really
well in that environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up. I know you've had 10 questions already on commercial real estate. But if we
look at this deep dive you did covering 60% of all commercial real estate loans, one, what are you learning? I
don't know if you're talking to building owners as you work through that process.
But as these come due, you have $1 billion or so in criticized. What's the expected work out? Will they put more
equity in? What are you expecting? And then, when you called out the 4.4% office reserve, is that a general
reserve on the office portfolio? Are those specific credits coming due where you're anticipating losses? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. I mean the $4.4 million is really a general amount. There could be a little bit of specific embedded in that. But
the bulk of it is more of a general reserve from what we're seeing from that perspective.
We are seeing our clients, our sponsors really step up and really support these credits. We think that charge-offs
that we had this past year were really more financial and institutional oriented. But our sponsors because they're
long-term real estate owners of the property, I mean they basically own properties where they want to own them
in a certain block and city of where they have it. So it's really long-term oriented. They tend to have really low tax
basis in these properties, and they're going to support these credits over time. So that's really what we're seeing
there.

When we go through and look at whether we should grade it as criticized or not, you're seeing some pressure on
the debt service coverage ratio. Once it falls under 1.1, it goes into the [ph] 11 (01:00:51), which is a criticized
camp. But the vast majority of what we have in criticized is between 1 and 1.1. Yes, we had 1s under 1 in that
level, but the vast majority we have there.
So over time, I think those will cure and won't result in loss for the most part. We did raise losses up a little bit for
2024. Some of that was really normalization on the consumer portfolio. And then, some of it is maybe working out
a few more credits off. But for the most part, what we have in criticized is not materializing into losses.

Yes. So we got a couple of things going on there. So if you look at what we have right now, we're probably going
to take anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion this year and move from cash into the securities book over time.
We're going to really focus on non-convex type securities. We don't have extension. So if we buy something at a
duration of three years, it stays in a three years perspective. Yields that we're seeing right now are probably in the
mid-4s, plus or minus. So I think that's going on pretty well.
The other good benefit that we have is we have about $9 billion of US treasuries. Those US treasuries average a
yield close to 2%. So those are going to reprice and we're going to put those back out in probably two, three, four-
year type duration or maturity treasuries, and we're going to reprice up over 200 basis points there. So I think
that's a real positive. So we're seeing a nice uplift in the securities portfolio.
The other thing to note â€“ and I'll just switch over to the loan book, Ken, if you don't mind â€“ is that on the consumer
book, our auto didn't really grow, but the volume we put on in our auto lending was like 250 basis points higher
than what it was rolling off at.
If you look at the RV portfolio, and that did grow some this past quarter, that was also up a couple hundred basis
points with a higher yield. So from a reactivity perspective, our fixed portfolios are starting to really show and
perform and to have much higher yields.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. That's great. Actually, it was going to be my follow-up on the loan side is do you have a broader way of
helping us think through either the proportion of that book that's fixed and reprices over the next year or two?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I would say it's mainly in the consumer book. It's the book that's probably going to reprice higher. From a C&I and
CRE perspective, most of that is more floating because we're more like 60% floating, 40% fixed.
So if you look at it like that, mortgage portfolio, for the volume we put on in mortgage will be I think probably at
attractive yields. There's not a lot of activity. We're going to originate and sell all conforming.
So we generate fee income and not put it on the balance sheet, but we will support our clients and wealth. We will
support our customers that we have for moderate and low-income housing. So there will be some volumes that go
on in those portfolios. So that way we reprice higher. That would just be a little bit slower because the volume
won't be as high.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And sorry, one more final one. Just you mentioned earlier the ongoing thought process of getting more of the
production off-balance sheet and kind of switching NII into fees. I'm just wondering where you are in that process
and build-out and infrastructure. And within that do you have an idea of where you think that the right commercial
real estate on-balance sheet concentration of the loan book should be versus the current 25%? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. So I would say our plans right now are to bring our CRE portfolio down probably another $3 billion. If you
look in the last couple years, we've been shrinking CRE about $3 billion a year. That gives us time to basically
work with our clients and meet their needs with more off-balance sheet alternatives. So we're doing it on a
measured pace, so we can do it and still meet the needs of our good long-term clients from that perspective.
As far as what percentage we're going to head for, I know it's going to be lower than 25%. I can't tell you. You got
a couple of things going on, CRE shrinking and the other portfolio increasing. So my guess is you'll probably see
a drop a little bit faster than you what might expect. If we're successful, we're growing C&I and some of our
consumer book.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Daryl, this is about expenses and the efficiency ratio. I mean, this is going back a while ago
that you, at one point, M&T had a 50% to 55% efficiency target. I know that hasn't been updated in some time. I'm
just wondering, what you think â€“ given that the efficiency will creep higher in 2024 based on the guide, what do
you think the efficiency will settle in, what's your normalized NIM?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. So when you look at efficiency ratio, it's all about growing revenues faster than expenses. That's really what I
kind of look at from that perspective.
We really have a challenging time in 2024 growing revenue so much just because we got net interest margin
coming down some. My hope is that it levels off 2024 and starts to grow later in 2024, so we can start in 2025 and
start to have positive operating leverage from that perspective.
I'd tell you I'm very pleased with working with the leadership team that we have here at M&T. We all agreed to
come in and all business lines came in with flat expenses, basically finding cost cuts to cover their merit
increases, and they kind of did that in their own businesses. So, I think that was really well done from that
perspective.
We're guiding up a couple of percent just because we're making some investments in some really key projects
like digital, like data. We have two transformations going on right now, one in finance, the other in commercial.
We're investing in our treasury management businesses.
So we've got a lot of investments. But given our leadership team, I feel good that we'll be able to contain what
growth we need there. And that we won't have â€“ the goal would be to have revenue grow faster than expense is
really what we try to shoot for. And that will kind of drive good positive operating leverage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So as a follow-up, do you think you can manage like a few percent growth in expenses in 2025 and 2026 kind of
just based on kind of your budgeting experience, notwithstanding like activity of volume-driven expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes. I mean when I look at the levers that we have on the expense side, there's a lot of opportunities. If you look
at it, our procurement and sourcing areas are continuing to improve and get better in that area. I think we still
have opportunities in our corporate real estate area to get more square feet down over time.
We're really working with workforce management and really how to do our operations the most efficient way
possible. I think our call centers have a lot of opportunity from automation perspective.
One of our themes that we have in 2024 is simplification, really trying to simplify what we are doing today. So on
the transformations that are going on, how we do this, we'll have less processes and much more simple way,
getting things done in a much more efficient ways of getting them done from that perspective.

For me, it always comes down to how we prioritize, we're going to prioritize in the priorities that we have in this
company, and I talked about those projects. If we can focus on those and really not have any of the other
investments kind of play out, we can control expenses really well and continue to generate positive operating
leverage as we get revenues to start to grow again.

Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sorry. And one last ticky-tack question. Bayview, what is the â€“ do you have any estimate on what that would be
for this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
We aren't 100% sure, but I would say 20, plus or minus, would be our best estimate right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you.
