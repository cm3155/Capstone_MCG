Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to those of you on the call. As usual, I will provide some big picture thoughts
before I turn the call over to Mike to discuss this quarter's results in more detail. In the fourth quarter of 2021,
Valley reported net income of $115 million, earnings per share of $0.27 and return on average assets of 1.08%.
Exclusive of merger charges, our EPS and ROA would have been $0.28 and 1.14% respectively. These adjusted
metrics include approximately $0.01 per share of after-tax provision associated with the non-PPP loans acquired
from the Westchester Bank.
We generated net income of $474 million and adjusted net income of $488 million in 2021. Adjusted net income
was up nearly $86 million or 22% from 2020. These exceptional financial results reflect the execution of our
strategic initiatives surrounding organic growth, credit preservation and positive operating leverage. We generated
organic loan growth exclusive of PPP and acquisitions of over 9% during the year. Growth was strong across our
markets, reflecting contributions from both Legacy Valley Associates and new hires. Loan production was funded
by low cost core deposits, which continue to increase across geographies and business segments.
Last quarter, I spoke about our ongoing evolution to a leading regional bank. While I won't rehash those
comments, I want to reiterate that today's banking landscape offers tremendous opportunity for service-oriented
bank like Valley. The recent acquisition of the Westchester Bank and the pending acquisition of Bank Leumi will
enhance our competitive position and ability to capitalize on this opportunity. These partners will bring us new
business capabilities and access to geographies that will enhance our competitive position and support our
growth targets. By the end of 2022, Valley will be well over $50 billion in assets with a high quality core fund to
balance sheet and strong capital position. In today's banking landscape, this is a very unique value proposition.
With that said, the exceptional progress that we have made as a standalone entity should not be overlooked. Our
adjusted 2021 ROA of 1.18% is nearly 40 basis points above our 2017 level. This improvement was not
dependent upon reserve releases. Rather, it is the result of net interest margin stability and consistent profitable
organic growth. As I think back on 2021, I'm proud of our ability to navigate COVID uncertainty early on. During
the year, we recognized a near $15 million of net charge-offs equating to just 5 basis points of average loans.
This incredible result is a testament to our lending and credit culture. I'm equally proud of our ability to quickly
pivot to an offensive position which enabled us to generate significant organic loan growth and identify ideal
merger partners during the year.
Looking ahead, I expect 2022 to be about execution, execution on the integration of our acquisitions, but perhaps
as importantly on the organic growth opportunities that exist for us. As relationship-focused commercial bank, we
strive to be consistently in tune with our clients' financial needs. This has been a key driver of recent originations
and will continue to support our organic growth going forward. With significant M&A and technology disruption
around us, there is an increasing pool of potential new clients which will provide an additional growth lever for
Valley. We are excited by the team we have in place and are confident they have the right support and technology
to capitalize on these opportunities.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss some of the quarter's financial highlights.

Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 6, you can see Valley's recent net interest income and margin trends with and
without the impacts of PPP. During the quarter, net interest income increased $14 million or approximately 5%.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
This was primarily the result of strong organic loan originations throughout the year, $3 million of net interest
income from Westchester and continued interest expense reductions. On a reported basis, net interest margin
increased 8 basis points to 3.23%. Exclusive of PPP, the margin increased 3 basis points to 3.10%. Our margin
has performed very well throughout the year despite the overhang of excess cash. We've actively driven down
funding costs and are benefiting from strong organic loan growth throughout the year.
Slide 7 illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding base. Over the last few years, we have introduced new
deposit niches and accelerated commercial deposit growth. This has reduced our reliance on higher cost CDs
and borrowings. This quarter, CDs and borrowings comprised 16% of total funding versus 29% a year ago.
Meanwhile, non-interest-bearing deposits including those assumed from Westchester increased 8% from the third
quarter and are up 27% from a year ago. During the quarter, our CD and non-maturity deposit cost declined 7
basis points and 3 basis points respectively. Our focus on low cost core deposit generation has led to a significant
reduction in funding costs and positions us well for potential rising rates as the year progresses.
Slide 8 details our loan balances and the key drivers of our strong 2021 growth. Exclusive of over $900 million of
commercial loans acquired from Westchester and adjusting for PPP runoff, organic growth was over 9% for the
year. On an annualized basis, our organic growth was over 13% during the fourth quarter with contributions
across our geographies and asset classes. On the bottom right, you can see the diversity of our growth by
segment. While CRE remains a key driver of our business, C&I growth was strong and consumer channels
contributed as well. C&I growth was the result of new relationships and a modest uptick in utilization rates. At
December 31, commercial line utilization was 40%, up from 39% at September 30, but still below the 41% level at
the end of 2020. As you know, we have somewhat de-emphasized the more transactional multifamily space which
did not contribute to our growth during the year.
The combination of new hires throughout 2021 and the acquisition of Westchester positions us for another year of
strong organic growth in 2022. Our well-diversified loan pipeline stands above $3 billion, which is in line with
September levels. We anticipate 2022 loan growth to be in the high-single digits. As you may expect, commercial
asset classes will contribute more than residential and consumer, but growth should remain well diversified across
our markets.
Moving to slide 9, we generated non-interest income of $38 million for the quarter. The $4 million sequential
decline reflected lower swap activity. Revenue from loan sale gains was stable as were our traditionally less
volatile other non-interest lines. Trust and investment services income was strong in the quarter, partially driven
by the addition of Dudley Ventures in October. Deposit service charges also normalized throughout the year.
While we anticipate swaps income to rebound from the fourth quarter level, the rate environment could weigh on
mortgage banking revenues in 2022.
On slide 10, you can see that our adjusted expenses were over $174 million for the quarter. This number includes
approximately $2 million for the operations of Westchester and Dudley, respectively. We remain focused on
generating positive operating leverage going forward. Over the last four years, our revenue growth has outpaced
expense growth by more than 2:1. While we continue to explore incremental expense offsets to absorb ongoing
investments, future positive operating leverage is likely to be more dependent on revenue growth. The acquisition
of both Westchester and Leumi will enhance our capabilities and reach and contribute to strong revenue growth in
2022 and beyond.
Turning to slide 11, you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters. Our allowance for credit losses
declined to 1.11% of non-PPP loans at December 31 from 1.12% at September 30. Despite realizing net
recoveries during the quarter, we've recognized a $6 million provision primarily to account for our strong loan

growth. We also recorded a $6 million provision related to the non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments
acquired from Westchester. It shouldn't be overlooked that our strong 2021 results were achieved without the
benefit of a reserve release. After a slight uptick in the third quarter, our non-accrual loan balances improved to 70
basis points at December 31. The improvement was primarily in the CRE segment. Despite entering the year with
uncertainty around the potential impacts of COVID-19, we are pleased with our credit performance and expect to
preserve our strong track record in 2022.
On slide 12, you can see that tangible book value increased over 2% for the quarter and over 9% for the year. We
are extremely proud of this result in the context of our healthy dividend payout and the closing of the Westchester
and Dudley acquisitions. Our commitment to producing consistent, tangible book value growth guides our
strategic decision-making process. We remain very comfortable with all of our capital ratios and believe that our
strong earnings performance will continue to support our organic growth efforts. With our strong capital position,
loan pipeline and enhanced core funding base, we're optimistic heading into 2022.
On page 13, you will see that we are reinstituting select guidance for the year. Specifically, we anticipate high
single-digit organic loan growth of between 7% and 9%. This should help to absorb a reduction in PPP income
and drive mid-single-digit net interest income growth for the year. We expect to preserve an efficiency ratio below
50% in 2022.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Ira for some closing remarks.

Thanks, Mike. I am extremely proud of our 2021 financial results. It was extremely busy year for our organization,
and I am grateful for our team's hard work and commitment. We are really excited about the opportunities ahead
of us in 2022 and believe it will be another great year for Valley.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Perito with KBW. Your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Mike, sorry, if I missed this admittedly due too much at once over here, but the rate assumptions behind the NII
guide, do you mind just expanding on that a little bit for us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. Appreciate that question. I know this has been a topic on many calls with many of our competitors as well.
Our guidance in the model is reflective as of 12/31 and it incorporates 25 basis points of Fed hikes occurring in
May, September and December. And as a reminder, we previously have disclosed this on our Qs and Ks. A 100
basis point shock increase would drive NII growth up 4.5% on a static balance sheet and clearly we won't have a
static balance sheet in 2022 with the loan growth that we're guiding to, but that'll help you get a better feel for
what we've actually baked in to our assumptions in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. So you have the three hikes in there. I guess the question is you kind of point this out the balance sheet
make-up. I mean, when you kind of look to budgeting, I mean what type of cash carryover do you guys assume or
if you can't get that specific, just I mean are you guys assuming some normalization of the cash in being deployed
or do you guys assume that it carries through conservatively for at least the first portion of the year here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. We do have some modest reduction in the cash or cash in the early part of 2022. I think the thing that you
should keep in mind is that more than likely the first place we would go if we're in a much more robust economy
and we saw some deposit attrition. So the good news is we have that buffer to kind of first take the blow if in fact
we have that which honestly given the deposit sources that we've built up over the year, including the amount of

growth that we have seen in both business and checking accounts across the company in the last two years,
mostly related to the way we use PPP to add new customers. I would expect that you would not see as much of a
reduction at least in the early rate increases as you might otherwise think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful, Mike. Thank you. And then just a couple more on the expense side, so ex-Westchester, you
guys were $172 million, give or take, which was a little bit above the range you guys provided last quarter, I mean
it seems like there's generally some industry-wide expense pressures upward. Curious if you could, do you have
a few moving pieces? I know the efficiency guidance is excluding the pending acquisition, but just curious if you
could provide a little bit more near-term commentary about how some of those expense pressures could come
through? And is it fair for us to assume that the $172 million probably has some upward pressure here as we
move forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. As you said, Mike, everybody in the industry, I think, is observing some upward pressure on overall
expenses, not the least of which is related to wages. And so, we're not immune from that as well. But as we said
in our prepared remarks, and I'll say it again, we're cognizant of those pressures. They are the reality of the
marketplace, but we still feel comfortable that we'll be able to manage our efficiency at or below 50%.
And probably more importantly, it's worth noting that we are willing to accept some disciplined expense growth,
especially if it leads to us being able to strategically capitalize on some of the investments that we're making. And
they don't always line up, right? The expenses oftentimes can lead some of the revenue growth. So we'll remain
focused on that. But I think the guiding principle that you should hear from us today is we're comfortable with our
overall efficiency ratio and in generating positive operating leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful. Got it. And just lastly, maybe a question for Ira. Just obviously 2021, a couple of bank deals, you guys
launched Valley Pay, growth in the cannabis sector, you grew down south, there's Dudley Ventures, there's quite
a bit that you guys kind of brought into the fold. And just as we think, at the onset of 2022 here, you kind of
touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but would just love what you think kind of the two or three
maybe more significant growth opportunities are from a tactical standpoint that you think we should be mindful of
as we begin the year here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you. I think we really establish a wonderful foundation for us for 2022. There's been significant efforts over
the last few years to really generate a strong foundation for organic growth and not just organic growth in the
geographies that we've historically been in, but organic growth capitalized and what we're seeing down in the
south, as well as some of the national platforms that we've been able to build, and I really believe that's going to
take off in 2022. Additionally, I think the ability for us to execute and layer in the two acquisitions from a traditional
bank perspective are going to be additive having more quicker than what we would have anticipated. But on the
periphery, when you look at something like Dudley Ventures as well, really the ability we have to incorporate that
and provide a little bit of alternative fee income for us, I think, is going to provide benefits as well for 2022, so as I

said on my prepared remarks, I couldn't be more excited about what we've built here moving forward and just
really realizing what that looks like in 2022 should be exciting for all of us.

Your line is open.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to first follow up on the expense commentary because if we look at the guidance, 50% or lower implies it
could go up or down from here. So, I'm not sure exactly what you're saying, what would be helpful can you give
us a sense like expense growth with the inflationary pressure you cited, is this a 5% year, is it a 3% year? Can
you give us a magnitude more from the expense growth side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Well, I won't put a number on it. I will say this. If you look at the fourth quarter numbers, we generated 3%
revenue growth against operating expense of approximately 4%. And so as I answered Michael's question earlier
around positive operating leverage, on a full year 2022 basis, we are still committed to positive operating leverage
and an efficiency ratio that's below those numbers, albeit acknowledging that we do have noise in the numbers,
right, through acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter combined with the impact of Leumi which is much larger
than those two previously closed or announced acquisitions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. Stephens, it's Travis, too. I mean, I would just say on the guidance side, I mean we do give you kind of a
range for NII growth rates that'll help kind of drive your revenue growth assumption. And then you can, I think,
utilize the efficiency guidance that we gave you to kind of get a range for expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Well, actually, following up on the net interest income outlook, the 5% to 7% is below the loan outlook. And
you have some rate benefit built in because you just said that. So, are you assuming deposits runoff, is that why
the NII outlook is below the loan outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
No, actually – Steven, this is Travis again. Just to be specific, right, we had $85 million of PPP income in 2021.
We have about $12 million left of unearned fees in that category. So, there's going to be significant decline in PPP
income and then we fill that bucket with a full year of Westchester and the benefits of rising rates, the benefits for
our balance sheet growth, the continued benefits of our interest expense saves. So we do not have deposit runoff
baked into the model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
No deposit runoff. Do you think, Travis, you can grow deposits next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance and Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
2022? Okay. That's helpful. And then finally Ira for you, as you said 2022 is the year you focus on execution and
you've obviously been active on the M&A front. Does this mean you don't plan to look at or pursue M&A
transactions for 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I will tell you I think we have an incredible ability across our entire organization to really do both as you saw
in the, I think, slide 4 when we talked about the benefits what we did from 2016 on the organic basis versus on the
acquired. So we've established a wonderful foundation here. I think there is tremendous opportunity, as I
mentioned before, about what Bank Leumi offers us as well as what the Westchester Bank offers us. And we'll be
remised if we didn't focus on executing that and really leveraging that from a growth perspective greater than what
we had before. That said, I do think there's going to be tremendous opportunity when we think about what's
happening with M&A and not just from a technology perspective, but also from a consolidation. I don't want to
distract anyone here internally, but there may be something on the periphery that makes sense for us that really
leverages what we think about from a strategic plan perspective. But there's so much tremendous upside on just
executing with the acquisitions we've done. That's going to be the primary focus for us.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And actually I lied if I could squeeze one more. The cannabis business, how much growth did you guys
have in the fourth quarter or where do those deposit balances end the year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It's well over in the hundreds of millions of dollars as to where the cannabis business is today. I think the biggest
opportunity there really is expanding some of the multistate operators. I think we're in 17 states right now with an
ability to go up to 27, I think, so we already have approved. We have over 40% of the current portfolio just in that
pipeline as well. So it's an area of continued opportunity and growth for us. We did begin to get tip of our toe into
the lending business a bit at the end of the year. And I think there'll be opportunities for growth in that space as
well.
And even with the Valley Pay, I think, as you mentioned, it's a closed loop payment platform that really enables us
to look at growth from a multitude of different perspectives whether it be internally or even white labeling, there is
a lot of opportunity for us. And if that agility that we're trying to create throughout the entire organization, for many
of the initiatives that we're putting forth, and once again, something we're very excited about.
