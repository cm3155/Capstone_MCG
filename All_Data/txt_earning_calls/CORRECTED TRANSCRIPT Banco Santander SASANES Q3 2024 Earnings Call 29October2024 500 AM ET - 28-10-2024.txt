Good evening, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Presentation. Like always, the presentation
will start with our CEO's, Héctor Grisi, comments followed by my more detailed explanation of the P&L. He will
have his concluding remarks and then we will open it up for questions. Héctor, please go ahead.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much, José. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. At today's presentation, as
always, first I will talk about our results in the context of our history. Then José will review our financial
performance in greater detail, and then I will conclude with some final messages as José said. We will then open
the floor for your questions.
So, the main highlights of our results in this first are the following. Q3 was another record quarter for Santander,
which continues to demonstrate the benefits from the execution of our strategy and the resilience of our business
model. Profit reached €3.3 billion, 12% above the Q3 of 2023, on the back of a solid franchise of 171 million
customers that continues to increase as we improve our customer experience through simplification, automation
and leverage of our global platforms.
Profit reached €9.3 billion in the first nine months, also a record of 14%, supported by strong customer revenue
growth across regions and all the global businesses. We achieved these as we invest for the future, and we
continue to make excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model which has helped us to
improve our efficiency by 229 basis points, and increase our ROTE to 16.2%. Finally, our balance sheet remained
solid with a sound capital ratio and robust credit quality, and contributed to the strong profitable growth,
shareholder value creation, and attractive remuneration. TNAV plus dividend per share increased by 14%, and
the cash dividend per share will be 39% higher in 2024.
Going into more detail into our income statement, as always, we present growth rates in both current and
constant euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them year-on-year, but as José will
display later, they are more significant on the quarter-on-quarter. Our P&L remained strong from top to bottom.
Number one, strong top line supported by all our businesses and regions. NII and fees, both at record levels,
accounted for over 95% of total income, driving the vast majority of our revenue growth.
Number two, expenses grew below revenue and inflation, showcasing the possible effects of our transformation –
sorry, the positive effects of our transformation. Three, loan loss provisions grew fairly in line with average lending
and credit quality also had an excellent performance. All in all, as shown over time, our results are sustainable
and less volatile than peers due to our business and geographical diversification, the high quality of our revenues,
and a prudent approach to risk.
We are on track to exceed the targets we set in January and upgraded in July. Solid business dynamics
supported high single-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio improved as we accelerate ONE Transformation
and the increased operational leverage. Cost of risk is expected to remain in line with our 2024 target on the back
of active risk management, a strong labor market, and interest rates dropping in most of our countries. As a

reference, year-to-date cost of risk improved to 1.14%, even with the additional provisions in Poland in Q2. Our
CET1 ratio ended September at 12.5% and we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above 12%
even after Basel III implementation fully loaded. And our ROTE is already above the target we set for the end of
the year.
Our execution of ONE Transformation continues to boost our operational leverage, structurally improving both
revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have
already contributed 259 basis points of efficiencies since we started, surpassing the levels which we expected to
reach at the end of 2025. Our global businesses continued to drive the group's profitability and have delivered 82
basis points in efficiency gains. Finally, our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 72 basis
points in efficiencies so far.
Remember that we are focused on going back to basics, offering the best products and user experience to our
customers and boosting operational leverage through our global platforms to support value creation for our
shareholders based on profitable growth with minimal volatility. This is already reflected in the great performance
of our businesses. All of them show solid revenue growth. Retail and Consumer and will strongly improve our
efficiency ratio, leading to higher RoTE, while CIBM payments reflect our efforts to develop new products and
global platforms which have started to deliver results.
This is a fantastic example of how our model works. Higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises,
while other parts of our business perform better under different circumstances. But, overall, our combination of
highly diversified businesses allows us to deliver consistent profitable growth and value creation. The global
businesses and the cross-collaboration are helping us to extract the full potential from our unique combination of
local leadership and global capabilities with a cost of infrastructure that delivers efficiency and scalability. This
allows us to reach our 2025 profitability targets.
In Retail, which is at the heart of our banking business, we are working to become the number-one bank for our
customers. Let's look at how ONE Transformation is delivering results. Innovation is key. We're enhancing our
digital onboarding and promoting simpler customer journey and better experiences across the bank. For example,
in Brazil, we have reduced the onboarding time by 50%, which has contributed to a 3% customer growth only this
quarter. We are progressing fast towards a common operating model across our banks, which together with
automation and digitalization, frees up time of our people to focus on commercial activities on our branches.
Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped by 11% since we started with ONE
Transformation.
Deployment of our global platform remains on track. And for example, in the UK, customer has been migrated to
our global app that already operates in Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Openbank with great success. As a result,
our profit grew 29% year-on-year, with RoTE up 400 basis points to 18.5% on the back of revenue up close to
double digit, on good performance of NII and fees with all regions growing, especially Europe and South America.
Cost is well under control, down 5% in real term, reflecting structural benefits from our transformation, and
provisions improving and the cost of risk fairly stable at really comfortable levels.
Going forward, our improvements in customer experience, the implementation of a common operating model, and
the deployment of our global tech platform will drive additional customer growth, better efficiency and profitability.
In Consumer, our priority is to continue expanding our leadership across all our footprint. Our best-in-class global
solutions are integrated into our partners' processes. For example, we have integrated our front in Hyundai
systems, providing our customers the best digital experience, faster credit approval, and time to pay.

We are making great progress in our deposit strategy to increase NII stability and reduce the funding cost.
Deposits increased 12% year-on-year on the back of our deposit gathering platforms. The deployment of global
platforms is key to scale up business, reduce our cost to serve, and improve profitability. Last Monday, we
reached an important milestone in the US with the nationwide launch of Openbank. In the last four weeks, we
have already gathered around €200 million in deposits and welcomed over 7,000 clients. We also launched Zinia,
a co-branded card with Amazon in Germany, and we are deploying a new operational [ph] digital (00:09:24)
functionality.
Consumer continues to grow a strong operational leverage with a 9% net operating income increase and [ph]
sound (00:09:34) profit growth on the back of, number one, strong revenue with solid NII performance and 25%
fee growth. Number two, cost falling 2% in real terms thanks to our transformation efforts even as we continue to
invest in growth. And third, LLPs normalizing in Europe and in the US in line with expectations. Overall, we
continue to see positive operating trends and we expect them to improve on the back of lower rates and volume
growth.
We are building our world-class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to
grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile. Number one, we are deepening our client relationships and
increasing our capabilities in the US, building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across the group.
Revenue in CIB in the US rose 41% year-on-year and is expected to boost cross-border revenue across the
group as we continue to progress on our US buildout initiative. We continue to execute our global markets plan,
which is starting to pay off with the institutional sales doubling in Europe and more than tripling in the US.
Number two, we're expanding and sophisticating our centers of expertise. We're strengthening our financial
sponsor franchise, which is leading to business opportunities in M&A, capital markets, and GTB across the group
and continues to pay off with several first deals. This quarter, for example, for the first time, we were appointed
sole book runner for an IPO of a SPAC and we acted as the lead left underwriter in an LBO transaction with one
of the largest industrial-focused investment firms. And these are just a few examples of a long list.
Third, we are driving cross-border revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration. We
had a great number of cross-border deals in Q3, such as those resulting from the collaboration of our teams in
Mexico and Spain, France and Brazil, Peru and Mexico, or Italy and France among others. CIB reached solid
results, with revenue up 9% after a record 2023, making the first nine months the best ever, [indiscernible]
(00:11:59) growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows. And the rest is
still to come. Growth will accelerate going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis.
Moving on to Wealth, we continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in Europe and the Americas.
How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and right solutions,
resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customer and fees. We are shifting our product offering towards
value-added solutions such as discretionary portfolio management, advisory and alternatives investments. And
this is also supported Spain's double-digit increase in the number of private banking customers and a 22% total
revenue growth.
Number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses, especially with Retail and CIB, which is a major
driver for growth and allow us to capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increased by 13% year-on-year.
Number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and
advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth. Good examples of these are the
5

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
recent implementation of a single operating platform for alternative products and the deployment of [ph] San
Conecta (00:13:27) in Mexico and Brazil, which boost the distribution network capabilities and provides real-time
information about funds and markets.
In summary, we're accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose 15% on the back
of a strong activity and fees growing at double-digit across the three businesses. Finally, efficiency improved 210
basis points year-on-year, and RoTE rose 400 basis points to 81%.
Finally, Payments. As I already advanced last quarter, we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain,
[ph] issuing (00:14:11) where we manage more than 100 million cards worldwide, and merchant acquiring. In
merchant, we are one of the largest acquirers in Latin America, Spain and Portugal with the right balance
between growth and profitability. Getnet total payments volume and PagoNxt open market revenue keeps
growing strongly, which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market such as Brazil and Mexico,
where we maintain a leadership position. And at the same time, we build up market share in fast-growing markets
such as Chile, where we recently launched Getnet.
Our Payments Hub already processes all type of payments. For example, credit transfers, direct debits, or instant
payments, and international payments for several countries and businesses. We have already migrated 800
million transactions this year. This is five times more than the same period last year.
Also, we continued to deploy Plard, our global cards platform. In Brazil, we currently manage more than 8 million
debit cards through Plard and we are on track to full migration by Q2 2025 to manage around 17 million total
cards. In our second phase, we will start with the credit card portfolio. At the same time, we continued to boost our
cards proposition through our Risk Data Lab, our solution based on AI.
Payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses, costs under control, and sound
credit quality in cards, which drove to a 10% profit growth excluding the non-recurring items [ph] with its
(00:15:48) cost in Q2. PagoNxt EBITDA margin improved to 23%, backed by Getnet, with one of the best ratios
among our competitors. We expect cost efficiency and CapEx optimization to continue to drive profitability in the
coming quarters.
Our capital ratio has improved this year from 12.3% to 12.5%, backed by strong organic capital generation after
investing in profitable growth, absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration. As a result, we
continued to grow our [ph] value creation (00:16:30), which in terms of TNAV plus DPS increased 14%, which
represents around €10 billion year-on-year. And we are increasing our shareholder remuneration.
In September, the Board of Directors approved an interim distribution against H1 2024 results, which is being
executed in two equal parts, a cash dividend of €0.10 per share which will be paid from the 1st of November, and
a share buyback program up to €1.5 billion. This is currently underway. Cash dividend will be 39% higher in 2024.
And at the same time, since 2021, if we include the full amount of the current share buyback program, Santander
will have repurchased 12.5% of its outstanding shares.
I leave you now with José who will go in our financial performance in more detail.

Thank you, Héctor. Let me go into more detail, the P&L and the capital. As Héctor has mentioned, we are yet
again reporting record results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage. Revenue grew 8% on

the back of the highest NII and fees in our history and the best efficiency ratio in the last years, boosting the net
operating income which rose 13% year-on-year. Provisions grew only slightly even after the expected
normalization in Consumer and the Swiss franc provisions in Poland we recorded in the second quarter, while
cost of risk fell in the quarter.
On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the upward trend in profit, which grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in
euros, 5% in constant euros driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions. This quarter, there is an
effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarter-on-quarter in comparison. But as you can
see in the P&L, the impact year-on-year is not material. Please remember that the last quarter, we decided to take
a more conservative approach to value – into recognizing the value of the results obtained in Argentina. So we
began to apply an inflation-adjusted exchange rate for the Argentine peso, which in the quarter was ARS 1,618
compared to the official exchange rate of ARS 1,069 to the euro.
And obviously, this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers. This approach
caused some distortions in the quarter-on-quarter comparison that I will comment during the presentation only
where relevant.
Total revenue increased 8% with all businesses and regions growing, driven by customer revenue growth which
made up more than 90% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business,
which continues to grow close to double digits with good performance in NII and fees, especially in the Americas,
and also by CIB growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels mainly in global
banking and markets. Consumer revenue also rose, supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing
and double-digit growth in fees across our geographies.
We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in Wealth, driven by solid commercial activity both in private
banking and in asset management. Payments is growing at good trends, showing relatively good underlying
performance as both PagoNxt and Cards increased, even more so if we exclude the one-time positive fee
recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of last year. Finally, the corporate center's revenue improved on the back of
less negative impact from FX hedging.
Turning to NII, net interest margin, most of our revenue came from net interest income, which increased 9% year-
on-year supported by all our businesses and regions, basically due to active price management particularly in
Retail in Europe and in Consumer, and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in South
America – in Retail South America, which is now very evident especially in Brazil and Chile – and also good
activity levels in our global banking business in CIB.
NII was resilient quarter-on-quarter, rising 1% in constant euros in a new interest rate environment, particularly
driven by Retail where it was up 2%, with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quarter.
Especially Brazil, driven by higher average volumes; Poland, due to better spreads and higher volumes; and the
UK supported by good price management.
In terms of profitability, we improved our net interest margin year-on-year. This is explained by higher yields on
assets as we actively manage credit spread focusing on profitability, not market share, which more than [ph]
outweighted (00:21:38) higher funding cost. We were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit
remuneration in Europe and deposit repricing downwards in South America.
As we commented last quarter, we are seeing a slight deceleration in net interest margin and net interest income
in line with our expectations. Please remember that the decrease in net interest margin in the second quarter was
7

due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in Argentina. And this quarter, net interest margin
was also affected by the hyperinflation accounting in Argentina under the appreciation of the real and the Mexican
peso, and to a lesser extent the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in Europe.
Over the last few quarters, we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for these
new monetary policy cycle. This and the positive contribution we expect from our Consumer businesses put us in
good condition – in a good position to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in Europe and North
America going forward.
In an environment of low credit demand in general, we generated another record in fee income, reflecting our
transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customer service. Retail
increased as more customers chose Santander as their primary financial service provider. We added 5 million
new customers over the last 12 months to a total of 171 million customers. Outstanding performance in
Consumer, largely driven by increased insurance penetration in Europe, CIB also grew from record levels last
year, especially in the US, on the back of strong dynamics in global banking. We had a 16% increase in Wealth,
with all three businesses growing at double digits. And Payments was impacted, as I mentioned before, by the
one-time positive fee recorded in the first quarter in 2023 in Brazil.
Our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains.
Our cost to income ratio for the nine-month period improved to 41.7%, the best level that we have reported in the
last 15 years, one of the best in the sector and is already at better levels than the guidance we provided for 2024.
Cost declined 1% year-on-year in real terms despite the lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other
costs and our investments in transformation.
By business, costs remain very well under control in Retail and Consumer, which represent 70% of our cost base.
More than 90% of the nominal cost increase came from CIB as part of our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise.
Cost remain contained in Wealth even with higher commercial activity and we're fairly flat in Payments, even as
we invest in global platforms. As we look ahead, structural improvements from our new operating model, which
help us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around 42% in 2024, while it should improve further
next year.
Credit quality remains robust, about – around and across our footprint, in line with our expectations. We record
low unemployment rates in most countries and easing monetary policies. Credit quality improved year-on-year as
reflected both in the NPL ratio and lower coverage needs. The NPL portfolio has collateral, guarantees and
provisions that account for 90% of its total exposure. 12-month cost of risk improved to 1.18%.
In our Retail and Consumer, 12-month cost of risk improved in the quarter. In Retail, there were some underlying
trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved across Europe and remained at very low levels in the
UK and Portugal. In Brazil, it fell for the second quarter in a row. And in Mexico, it also declined in the quarter
following a year of expected normalization. Similarly in Consumer, 12-month cost of risk was impacted year-on-
year by the normalization we expected, but it dropped in the quarter to 2.12%. The cost of risk in the first nine
months of the year was 1.14%, putting us in good position to end the year comfortably within our target of 1.2%.
Finally, turning to capital, our fully loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level, backed by strong organic
capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter, we generated 43 basis points
organically on the back of 52 basis points from profit generation, partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth and
by minorities. We recorded a 26-basis-point charge for shareholder remuneration, in line with our 50% payout
policy. We had 18 basis points of regulatory charges, mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios.

And finally, we had positive impacts from the placement of Santander Poland and ALCO portfolio valuations,
which were offset by impacts on deductions, pensions in the most part – for the most part.
We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization
capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new
book return on risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of
23%, well above that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims to optimize
capital deployment, is achieving outstanding results.
In the first nine months of the year, we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to €40 billion in risk-
weighted assets at a cost of capital of half of that of new originations. In addition, one-third of our balance sheet
that matures every year is being substituted by more profitable new business. The combination of these actions
explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio.
That's all from my side. Héctor, back to you. Thank you.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. It is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for 2025 in our last Investor
Day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of
our strategy by our teams. Sound CET1 levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans, further
improving our profitability towards 16% and delivering 14% value creation and increased remuneration to our
shareholders.
In conclusion, the benefit from the execution of our strategy are evident. Q3 was another record quarter on the
back of strong customer revenue, with all regions and businesses contributing, which results in the best nine
months profit ever, with all-time high NII, fees, and net operating income at a 19% EPS growth. Sustained
progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model leveraging the group's scale is
driving both high revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have reported for the last 15
years.
Our rock-solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder
value creation. As a result, we remain on track to exceed the 2024 targets we set in January and upgraded last
quarter, and we are in a great position to continue growing, increasing profitability and delivering shareholder
value creation. The progress of the last 10 years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now
deploy our own tech stack is already evident. And as we continue to execute our strategy, we will deliver on the
primary target of double-digit TNAV per share plus DPS growth through the cycle. And now, we're very happy to
take your questions. Thanks.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP
Paribas. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas Exane
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for the presentation and for taking the
questions. I have two if I may. The first one is on NII, just to get a bit of a better understanding of the moving parts
of the NII during the quarter. And also, how should we expect about the group top line, group NII in coming
quarters? The second one would be on cost outlook. Given the solid performance that we have seen in the
quarter, how should we think about cost performance going forward? And as per José's comments in the
presentation, what kind of improvement should we expect in terms of cost to income for 2025? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. Let me give it a first hit and then José basically – could give you other idea. It's interesting to
see that if you see NII in constant, you'll see that it's 1% up, okay? The effect of Argentina is the one that hitting
us in the current euros, okay? It is important to explain, first of all, that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to
movements in rates is mostly concentrated in Retail and Commercial business. This is about 60% of the group
balance sheet, with some parts showing really positive sensitivity in Europe, and others are negative ones like the
one we have in Brazil as you already know. Europe and Brazil concentrate about 80% to 90% of the rate [ph]
exposure (00:31:50).
Over the past few quarters, we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the
different balance sheets and position them to lower rates environments. For example, in the case of Europe, we
have reduced the sensitivity to around 25%. That's one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle. In
places like Brazil, for example, we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to
the ALCO and also taking some hedges. As you have already seen this year, the Retail business, its operating
leverage is 10 points. We are growing the top line not just because of higher interest rates, but also because
we're changing the operating model, which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate.
We're growing customers, for example, 2.6 million in the third quarter alone, and we are keeping cost flat, which is
quite important because that's creating an operating leverage and improving our margins. And this basically a
thing that we will continue improving thanks to, first of all, the geographical and business identification, the strong
focus on capital allocation, and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point. I don't know, José, if
you would like to complement on the margins and then we'll take on cost.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yes, definitely. Thanks, Héctor. So let me explain Argentina in a bit more detail. In June, we used an exchange
rate of ARS 1,499 and we explained at the time that we are devaluating, depreciating the exchange rate with
inflation, independent of the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate, as of now, is ARS 1,069. For the
quarter – for the end of the quarter, we used ARS 1,618. And remember that when you use ARS 1,618 in inflation
accounting, you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate.

So, we had two impacts on our P&L. One, there is over €100 million negative quarter-on-quarter increase in the
monetary position that comes in other income. And in Argentina, as interest rates come down and we have a very
liquid balance sheet that is invested mostly in bonds, the yield earned on this bond portfolio is lower. And quarter-
on-quarter, there is over €200 million drop in local currency. When you look at local currency, there is over €200
million drop in the yield coming from these investments. So, Argentina actually explains most of the drop in net
interest income quarter-on-quarter. But also, it means around a €300 million over €300 million impact on total
revenue.
So, as Héctor explained, we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates both in euros and in Brazil, which
obviously outside Europe is the highest sensitivity we have. In Europe, we have been buying an increase in the
ALCO portfolio. If we look at the total euro ALCO portfolio we have, which is Spain, Portugal, Santander
Consumer Finance, we have €50 billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over 6 years and a
yield of 3.2%, 3.3%.
The second action we took was to float the liabilities, the market liabilities, and we also hedged the repricing of
our mortgages in Spain by signing some forward starts. So this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest
income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of
higher rates.
In Brazil, we did the opposite. In Brazil, we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets. Net-
net, when we look into 2025 over 2024, we see NII down a little bit in current euros, but we see NII up in constant
euros, thanks to these measures that we have discussed. And these estimates are based on forward curve rates
– forward rate curves, sorry.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. Ignacio, in terms of cost, it is very important that you understand the following. This is not about
a cost-cutting exercise. This is about changing the model and the go-to model we're basically introducing in the
whole group. It's talking about – I mean, take a look at the amount of the catalog of products that we have in the
group. We have diminished them by almost a third. From 10,000 products, we're down to less than 7,500, for
example. We are changing completely the model we're doing in strong simplification. We're doing a lot of
automation. But most importantly, by deploying the global platforms, we are working together and spending less
money on what we do every single day.
So, ONE Transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage. Just a piece of that. The
cost grew less than half of the revenue growth. We're delivering positive jobs that are helping to reduce the
efficiency to 41.7%, which is 229 basis points lower than a year ago. This is placing us on track to meet the target
being at 42% in 2024. So, we're going to be much better and we believe that we're going to continue that. The
new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost, okay? Our ambition is not to lower cost – is exactly to lower cost in
absolute euro million terms, which is quite important, given all the different countries that we operate.
It is true that costs are up 2.5%, but we look at the cost performance in real terms. In real terms, costs are down
minus 1% year-on-year. That's a remarkable performance as to the operating leverage, with the strong declines
that I described in Retail, reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment in Consumer and
Payments, while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow, right? So, the higher cost, as José
explained, reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects [ph] and salary (00:38:14) agreements,

bonus accrual, and CIB is the bulk because we're investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue
and it's actually getting there.
So, in 2024, efficiency ratio is around 42%. We acknowledge this ratio is already at the level we committed for the
2025 ID target, and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain cost flat but grow the
revenue faster. So our ambition is therefore to do better than initially planned next year in 2025 in the cost to
income as we described. So I don't know if that basically answered your questions.

Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes, hello. So, thank you for the presentation and taking the questions. First one is on motor finance business in
the UK. I know that you need time to analyze the recent ruling, but I wonder if you can give an indication of how
big the provision it needs, whether we are talking about hundreds, billions, or – and also the impact on the
business.
And my second question is on capital. If you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next,
and also on the Basel III impact of up to 50 basis points on a fully loaded basis. Other banks have reduced the
impact at the recent regulatory updates. So if you can also comment on this. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. Okay. First of all, let me tell you that, I mean, as you correctly said, it's not possible this
time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling, other elements that affect the financial impact on our
accounts. This said, in any event, the potential impact is not expected to be material for the group's financial
position, okay? It is very important. Nor will it affect the achievement of the group financial targets for 2024. So if
you make the numbers and we are reiterating the guidance of above 16%, that basically tells you where do we
believe the number is, okay? So, it's very important, and I will reiterate, that again, that it will not change our 2024
guidance. So that basically gives you a ballpark idea of where do we believe the number should be.
I don't know, José, you've – I left something out or...

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, I think that's perfect, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
And in terms of – why don't you go to the capital thing is...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Remember that we estimated supervisory charges to be between 20 to 30 basis points in the second half
of the year. We had 18 basis points in the third quarter. We still believe that it's going to be at least 20 to 30 basis
points. So, this doesn't change our target. So our target for capital for year-end, remember, since the beginning of
the year has been between 1,240 to 1,250. We are at 1,250 in the upper end of the range, and we think we could
– we will close the year more or less at this level.
For next year, day-one Basel III impact basically close to zero, slightly negative to slightly positive, but it's not
going to change much. So, day-one capital ratio for Santander under Basel III will be more or less the same with
which we will end 2024. And the fully loaded – when I mean fully loaded, I mean fully loaded, taking into account
all the charges we expect up to 2033. So we are not excluding the 2029 to 2033 charges. So, fully, fully, fully
loaded, we think the impact is going to be 40 basis points, which means that we will be, on day-one, above the
12% that we set as our target. Fully loaded capital above 12% on day-one, fully loaded.
Thank you. Thank you, Paco. Next question, please.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Can you hear me – yeah, okay, sorry. Yeah, I just had two follow-up questions really, one on capital generation.
So, you've given basically a very limited impact for the next 10 years, which you're already at 12.5%. And with the
mobilization you're doing on the balance sheet, it does look like you generate – you're going to generate capital
above the 12.5% you're currently sitting on. So, the question is, as we think about 2025, 2026, are you willing to
operate in a range of 12.5% to 13%, let's say, or do you expect to grow into that 12.5%? Or would you consider
sort of increasing any – distributing in any excess or increasing the payout? I just wanted to understand how
you're thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation.

And on – and apologize to follow up on the Santander UK because that's the only explanation in my view why the
share price might be down this morning. You've been quoted, José, as saying that it's less than €600 million. And
I understand it's not an impact for 2024, but it might be an impact beyond that. So, any details you can give us on
the book, if it's new cards, the size of the book, or any details that make you confident that we're looking at a
relatively manageable number, that would be great. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Alvaro. Okay. Let me explain to you a little bit what is very important. I mean, as you know, José
explained you exactly what we're doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet, okay? You got to understand that
we're changing completely the model of the bank in the way we used to. The bank used to consume a huge
amount of RWAs to generate profits, okay? We're changing the model in a way.
And the most important thing of that changing the model is becoming the number-one bank to our clients. By
becoming that, basically you generate quite a lot of – quite a lot of revenue by something different. I just used
RWAs in order to generate those. That basically explains you the good fees momentum that we're having, and
you're going to continue to see that over in the future, all right?
So, if we continue changing this model, use less capital to become actually much more profitable, that basically
will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital than we're doing today, all right? We feel
really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at these levels of capital. But I do believe that we'll be –
we will be accumulating capital. Also, as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets, we also have now,
with the asset desk in place, tremendous capacity to move those assets out of the books, all right? So – and by
the way, if you saw what José said, we are doing so and making money on top of it.
Also, we're servicing – we're getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell. So, it's a double whammy in that
sense. So, the model of the bank is changing in that sense and is becoming much more profitable and less
dependent on capital. So, yes, I believe that capital generation will be much better. And we believe that we could
be accumulating more capital on an organic way in the future.
On the UK, José, I don't know if you want to also complement something on Capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. I think Capital, you answered perfectly. Alvaro, the issue is complex. And I think – just let me remind you of
some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months. We need to clarify the perimeter of
commissions. We need to clarify the vintages because the ruling talks of between 2005 to 2024. The FCA focuses
between 2014 to 2021. The percentage of redress, the claim rate, the compensatory interest – So there are many
moving parts. The ruling has been taken to the Supreme Court. We expect the FCA report in May. So there are
many moving parts. We are analyzing these, and obviously we will make a very conservative assumption once we
are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation.
However, we are very confident that, as Héctor explained, the impact, and I'm talking about what we will charge in
the next few weeks with this conservative approach, will not be material for the group and we will still meet our
objectives, our return on tangible equity target for the year, which is 16% or slightly above 16%. And that's what
we can say. What happens with the FCA report in May, that's basically a speculation. So, obviously, we will make
a decision based on the actual ruling, based on if we have time to take into consideration the Supreme Court
guidance on these, and in any case, obviously, the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Antonio Reale from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Antonio Reale Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one is on the outlook
for loan growth in Brazil. If I look at loans, we're flat quarter-on-quarter in local currency, which is perhaps not
particularly encouraging for the NII outlook in the context of rate hikes in the region. Can you talk about your
expectations for loan growth here and what this means for NII in Brazil? And maybe could you also please remind
us what the time lag is with respect to repricing between assets and liabilities in Brazil? I understand your liability
reprices much faster than assets. If you could remind us how many months in lag that is.
And my second question is with respect to the US profitability. I mean, these are the parts of your business that's
negatively correlated to rates. You've been adding quite a decent number of investment or corporate bankers in
the region which is showing good momentum in fees. Could you maybe just talk us through the key P&L line
items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward, please? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Antonio. Let me go a little bit, I mean, through the Brazil situation, okay? To tell you a little bit what's
going on. It's very important that you understand the following. In Brazil also, we are changing a little bit the model
that we have today. As you know, we used to use very highly RWAs. We used to basically give out a lot of loans.
Now we're changing a little bit the way we do things. We're basically focused on profitability, okay? Laser focus on
profitability, which is basically changing a little bit the mix, also changing a little bit, I mean, the way we manage.
And we're managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division. We used to basically grow in every single
segment. Now we're not doing so. We're basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability
and the best cost of risk in equal.
So, we're being very choosy in the way we manage that, and we're doing that all along the group. Also, we are
very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that gives deposits
and have their deposits with us. There are also their payrolls. And it's quite important to understand that that
basically is going to improve margins because we're improving the funding of overall of the franchise in Brazil,
okay?
NII, if you see, this is a good quarter. It's up more than 3% in the quarter, it is more than 22% in year-on-year.
What's behind the performance? As I told you, healthy volume growth, changing the mix and the local rates
because we're doing and increasing the number of clients. You will remember in my presentation, I talked about
the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients. It is true that
the rate outlook has changed. Well, now the market is having some rate hikes.
That will mean the NII growth will be a bit less intense than we expected, and we thought at the beginning of the
year, but nevertheless, we still expect Brazilian real to grow around the mid-teens mark by the end of 2024 and
we will have further growth in 2025. And if we continue with our strategy on gaining clients and gaining more
deposits at a good place, I think we could be better off, okay?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
And let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that Brazil has delivered almost a 17% RoTE. This is
strong profitability improvement. It is not just reliant on NII growth, but also, it is very important, the good delivery
on fees, because also, as I explained, we're becoming the number one bank to our clients. So, selling other
products, insurance, so more things that are basically helping us out. Also, it is very important to take a look at the
cost contention that we have had and also and stable cost of risk in the year. I believe that and – I don't believe, I
really remain very optimistic on Brazil and the ability to continue expanding its profitability through 2025, okay?
I don't know, José, if you would like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So, liabilities in Brazil basically reprice automatically with interbank rates. So, almost 100% of the liabilities
are linked to the interbank rates. 60% of the assets mature in 12 months. So, that gives you a sensitivity of the
positive sensitivity – sorry, negative sensitivity we have to rates in Brazil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Let me go into the US, Antonio. So, it's very important to understand, first of all, that we are not a full-
fledged commercial bank in the US. We are focused on the businesses. We are focused, okay, we are focused
mainly in our Consumer business. The Consumer business, as you say, has negative sensitivity to rates. That's
exactly why we launched Openbank there. And we're also using SBNA, our Commercial bank, to fund that, right?
We've been also changing the mix in a very strong way. I was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we
have. And you're talking about a mix that is 42% with FICOs really on the prime and near-prime level, okay?
And we're decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep subprime and subprime. So, that basically mix
combination, and – is going to give you a pretty good idea of what we're doing there.
In terms of Consumer, it's very important that you understand that, I mean, as you know, we are [ph] an at-scale
(00:53:59) player. We are also leveraging the relationship we have with the OEMs and we were able to capture
very good agreements with INEOS, Lotus, Tesla, and Mitsubishi. It is very important for you to understand that
some of these changes in the P&L, you're not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of
these is basically done, for example, on the electrical vehicles. And the electrical vehicles, we're buying them
because it's mostly leasing.
So, that basically tells you that it's not going to appear on the revenue line, but you'll see it on the take back we
have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles. So that basically changes a little bit the outlook. But, all
in all, I really see that the US will continue to thrive over the next year or so, okay?
Also in the Commercial side, the business is doing well. We have [ph] this (00:54:58) expertise. We – also, you
know that we have this JV with the FDIC which has been tremendously successful and I think will continue so. It
has had a solid performance. And then you talk about the CIB advisory services. CIB just grew 41% year-on-year
in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business. But also, you don't see how the US is helping the rest
of the business to thrive. If you take a look at the fees in CIB in Europe also are being pushed up by all the
businesses we are doing by using the US teams to help us out, getting some of new business that we didn't use
to get.
Also in Latin America, if you take a look at, for example, not just cross-border M&A, but if you take a look at what
we've been doing in DCM, you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in DCM in
16

that market just because of the expertise we brought into the table. So, when the Mexican UMS did a €7 billion
transaction at the beginning of the year, we were one of the four banks and we were the only non-American bank
in the game. So, those are the particular things that are happening to us, given that now we have this – with the
local strength that we have, we're combining the global expertise that we're bringing on to the table.
And Wealth also, we have a leading brand in Latin America. That business is basically working as a Swiss clock.
So I really do believe that the US will continue to thrive. Very good outlook for 2025 and really good numbers
coming up in terms of the P&L we see there.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is on Spain. So you have been losing market share in
loans and deposits over the past year. You have recently made management changes at the top for the Spanish
business. Do you foresee a change of strategy or [indiscernible] (00:57:10) capital, but how do you see loans and
deposits in Spain going forward?
My second question is on the US deposit. So the cost and the volumes are flat in the quarter. You've just only
launched Openbank in the country. On your website, you're saying you're paying 11 times the national average
for deposits. How much do you expect in terms of volumes to gain from your Openbank franchise and where do
you see the cost evolving?
And just quickly, and I'm not sure if [indiscernible] (00:57:45) correctly, the US effective corporate tax rate for
2025, I understood that there are changes on [indiscernible] (00:57:51) tax credit. Thank you.

Sorry. It's a question on Spain. So – sorry, this might be – sorry for that. So, on Spain, you've been losing market
share in long-term deposits over the past year, you have made management changes at the top. So do you
expect a change of strategy, more risk appetite? Where do you see loans and deposits going forward in Spain?
Secondly, in the US, so you've launched Openbank. So far your volumes and cost of deposits are flat in the
quarter. How much deposits do you expect to bring to the platform and where do you see the cost going forward?
And sorry, the effective tax rate in the US. Thank you and [indiscernible] (00:58:50).

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Marta. Let me go ahead. In terms of the many changes we have done to Spain, basically, they're not
going to change the plans that we had before. We're going to basically very much focus on profitability. That's
number one. We're also changing the model – Spain is one of the most important places where we believe we
have an opportunity on ONE Transformation, okay, due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of
simplification, automation in what we have there. A lot of – if you compare one of our branches, for example, in
Portugal versus our branches in Spain, 90% of what we do in our branch in Portugal is basically taking care of
clients. 50% of what we doing in Spain is taking care of incidents, problems, different situation, etcetera.
So, it's very important that we do that simplification and then transformation and automation that we need to do on
the back in Spain. So we make our business much more reliable, much more efficient, and with a much better
cost structure. Thirdly, we are, as you know, deploying the global platforms, and Spain is one of the places that
we're going to be concentrated the most in the near term, all right? So, it's quite important to understand that we
will continue doing that and we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit rates as we have done,
right? So, maybe much concentrated on that.
Getting new clients. It is very important to acknowledge that for the seven consecutive months, we have grown on
clients in Spain in a mature market. That basically tells you that the model is working, that exactly we're delivering
on what we believe is the right thing to do. So, we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms
of transforming in Spain in what we need to do, but also with the global platforms, we're going to be able to be
much more competitive, more efficient and better for our clients.
Also, this structure of being the number-one bank to our clients is very important in Spain because this basically
will allow us to sell them more products. One product that is very important and we are punching below our
weight, is Insurance, for example, in which some of our competitors are much more bigger than us in that sense.
So, there's a huge opportunity of where we can do that.
Also, if you take a look on CIB, CIB [ph] we have had a (01:01:19) really interesting and important lever given that
we're using our US teams to support what we're doing here in Spain. So, that is helping us out quite a lot and
we've been actually number one in the market for the whole year. So, Spain will continue, as we say.
In terms of...

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
No, no. I wanted to talk a little bit. I mean [ph] Joe said that (01:01:48) – I believe that 2024 in all in all is going to
be a strong year for Spain. We remain optimistic of NII. We see growing in high single-digit together with
customer growth, as I told you, and higher transactionality. And we will drive our revenue up by about double-digit
here. The efficiency ratio will continue improving, and we see the cost of risk below 50 basis points by year-end,
okay? And also, strong improvements in RoTE to a level well above 20%.
So, José, if you would like to comment to the US?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Just quickly, Marta, this year, the tax rate is going to be more or less close to zero. Actually, we're going to
actually have a slight credit from the sale of EVs. And from here, it should gradually normalize as we do less EVs
and more contribution from other businesses. So, we could think of like around 10% next year, maybe 15% the
next year. So, gradually normalizing at that pace, at more or less 10% next year, 15% the following year.
Yeah. Okay, thanks. Next question, please.

Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Yes. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions from my side as well. Firstly, on the US – on the UK NII outlook, we
saw good recovery in the first Q. We actually saw improvements in loan yields and also a lower deposit cost. I
was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the fourth Q and into 2025. Should we expect margin
expansion to prevail or should we expect it to stabilize – the customer spreads to stabilize more or less around
these levels? Just basically, how do you see the outlook for NII in the UK?
And then if I may pick up a bit on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before, you mentioned
that you lowered the NII sensitivity in Spain to 25% of what it was prior to the change in rate cycle. I was just
wondering if you could update us on exactly where the sensitivity lies now, particularly for Spain, but also for
some of the larger geographies. That would be much appreciated. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Carlos. Okay. On the UK, I would like to tell you, I mean, I think it is one of the countries that we have
one of the greatest opportunities in terms of ONE Transformation. We have a very good advantage of simplifying.
That's something that we are very concentrated on. Also the automation, what we're doing there, we are actually
lowering the amount of people that we have. We started the year with 20,000 people. We're going to end up with
18,000. So simplification and automation is well underway.
And then as I said on the presentation, it is quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms.
OneApp came into the UK just about. We did a big bang and changed all our clients there, and it's becoming
really helpful in order to gain new clients, helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of NPS,
okay?

It is important to say that we believe that we have much better market and economic dynamics, okay? Lending
activity, we see it picking up. We are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well. We see more
rational behavior of the UK banks, better pricing on the new loans, plus their pricing of deposits. We are
proactively managing deposits, as I told you. First of all, with the new clients coming in, with the new Edge
account that we launched, that's been helping us. So we reiterate our view that NII will improve in the H2 versus
H1, okay, as we have said. We're going to finish 2024 with NII down only mid-single-digit instead of the minus 9%
that we have reported in the first nine months, and we expect further rate cut in the remaining of 2024. But the
outlook of 2025 is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So, Carlos, in terms of interest rate sensitivity – so let me comment for the main countries. For the group as a
whole first. In constant euros, as I said, we would expect NII to increase next year, maybe 2%, 3%. In Spain, you
have seen a 2.5% interest rate in Europe for the mid of next year of 2025, we would expect a slight decrease in
NII in Spain. In the UK sector, just commented, a slight increase in NII. In the US, we would expect high single-
digit increase. In Mexico, mid to high single-digit increase.
In Brazil, this is quite important. The outlook for interest rates in Brazil is really important to estimate the future
evolution of NII. We expect average interest rates in Brazil next year to be around 11%, 11%, 11.5%. With this
level of interest rates, NII in Brazil should be up mid-single-digits. And basically – and finally in DCB also, high
single-digit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about.
So, as I said, if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in Europe, for
instance, or in DCB as interest rates were going up, the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly,
significantly lower.
Thank you, Carlos. Next question, please.

Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First of all, a question of extrapolation. Consensus is forecasting no growth
of profits in 2025 versus 2024. You are currently growing profits at 14% year-on-year in the nine months. And I
know you usually give guidance in February, but do you think 2025 profits will actually be above 2024 in your
view?
And the second is a follow-up on the capital [indiscernible] (01:08:37) you have done before. I'm looking at Slide
23. Without regulatory headwinds, you would have built 35 basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution.
Can you confirm with Q4, we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds? And is the higher
profitability then yielding to higher capital buildup versus the 10 basis points per quarter guidance that you have
given us?
Final thing is a clarification on Basel IV. Before you said that on day-one, CET1 should be flattish. If I remember
correctly, there were 20 basis points of impacts this year that should have reversed, so it wasn't for adoption. Can
you clarify that? Thank you.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Andrea. Let me give you a little [ph] demeanor (01:09:36) of what we believe. First of all, I must tell
you that I have great confidence that we will deliver, and in some metrics like cost to income over deliver on the
financial targets that we said on the Investor Day for the period of 2023 to 2025, okay? 2025 will be better than
2024. For 2025, we expect to continue to grow revenues, especially fees, as I explained with the new model
deployment that we're doing. We're going to further improve the operating leverage and we're going to deliver
higher profitability.
And we will do these, how? By leveraging further the global and network businesses, okay? We're putting a lot of
focus on increasing the network effect. We're doing more with less, first of all. Leveraging also our products on
global factories, like for example, from our Corporate bank into our Commercial banks, what we're doing between
CIB and the Commercial business on the midsized companies and SMEs. Also, ONE Transformation is
leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in Retail. We're talking about minus 4% on year-to-year
cost per active customer and 6% year-on-year revenue per active customer.
So, since the start of the program, the number of products, as I said before, is down almost 36%, okay? 60% of
the products are now digitally available to our customers. That's 9% points up since we started the program,
right? In summary, the strategy and business model diversification, disciplined approach to capital allocation, we
will, we believe, deliver a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to
come. So, all in all, yes.
José, I don't know if you would like to...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
...comment into the capital questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Let me give you all the components of the capital ratio and I think you can make your own conclusions here. So,
on Page 23, we show 43 basis points of organic capital generation, post [indiscernible] (01:11:34) cost of hedges,
etcetera, which includes 19 basis points negative from organic risk-weighted asset growth, which is €1 billion
growth, partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around 11 basis points, or €5 billion. Remember that so
far this year, we've mobilized €35 billion to €40 billion in terms of risk-weighted assets.
And on markets and others, we have 7 basis points from the sale of Poland. So, with these, I think you can
conclude what more or less the recurring capital generation we will be able to have going forward. Obviously, the
net risk-weighted asset growth, gross risk-weighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key
component. Obviously, that excess capital is being – or that capital is being reinvested at 2.9% return on risk-
weighted assets. But, obviously, it's capital that is being reinvested.

Basel IV. You're right, the maturity will – the impact, the negative impact of the 21 basis points or 22 basis points
we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year and this will compensate the
other negative impact, day-one impacts that we have mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios,
corporate portfolios, etcetera. So, net-net, it's – obviously, zero is the net of some positives and some negatives.
And amongst the positives is this 20 basis points from the maturity we use in derivatives transactions. You're
right.
Any – Andrea, thank you. Next question, please.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Sorry, I'm going to come back to capital in
particular. If you can give us actually the path of those 40 basis points you have on the fully loaded basis actually
held out [indiscernible] (01:13:50) actually with the next years, and specifically how much of that is going to fall on
2025? And sorry if you have referred to this actually, but I just want clarification.
And then related to this and going back basically to what Alvaro was asking before, I mean, what is the preferred
use of any potential excess capital that you're building? Are you thinking basically of accelerating growth,
spending a little bit of that, or – it's a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing
distributions.
And then the final on the capital, actually, if I may, what kind of budget for SRTs actually you have per annum in
the next two to three years building up into your capital forecast? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So the 40 basis points, as you remember, we are not affected by the output floor because we use lots of
standard models. So, that 72.5% limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models, we are not
affected by that. That is backloaded. That's what comes later from 2029 to 2033 if I'm not mistaken. We are
mostly affected – the 40 basis point is mostly the result of operational risk. That will come over the next four or
five years, if I'm not mistaken. So that's how these 40 basis points are going to be added to the phasing in our
case.
I think Héctor already answered the question about the excess capital and budget. On a recurring basis,
obviously, the demand for private credit today is enormous. It's almost – I'm not going to say it's infinite, but it's
huge. So, obviously, I don't think we are going to have this type of demand as interest rates come down
obviously. But we think that on a recurring basis, we should be able to mobilize somewhere between €35 billion to
€55 billion in risk-weighted assets. Both – obviously, SRTs will only be maybe a third of that, €15 billion a year. It
is reasonable to assume that €10 billion to €15 billion will come from SRTs, and the other will be from other types
of hedges and other types of transactions, asset sales, etcetera, like we did this year.
But on a recurring basis, with a more normalized market, €35 billion, €40 billion per year is like a reasonable
number.
Thank you, Ignacio. Next question, please.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. This is Sofie from JPMorgan. So, sorry to just go back to the organic [ph]
data (01:16:36) generation, but on the analyst call that you hosted a few weeks ago, you said – or [indiscernible]
(01:16:43) said that you target net zero risk-weighted asset growth and around 50 basis points organic capital
generation per quarter. Is that reasonable to assume going forward? And – yeah, that would basically be my first
question.
And then the second question is that M&A is a quite hot topic in Europe at this point in time. If you're going to
generate more [indiscernible] (01:17:11) going forward, how do you think about inorganic growth opportunities?
What would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of product or region? And yeah, if you could
talk about your thinking around M&A.
And then the last question would be around Brazil asset quality. I noticed that the NPL ratio ticked up by 3%
quarter-on-quarter, and also, coverage came down quite a lot in Brazil. How should we think about this? Thank
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie. Yes, I mean, the answer is in organic capital generation, yes, you're right. I mean, that's about
it. Okay? In terms of the inorganic opportunities, I do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the
group. I think that the chances – and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming best-
in-class versus the best-in-class in every single market that we operate, that basically tells you the huge
opportunity that we have in front of us. And we will continue like that. We will concentrate on our changes on the
go-to model of the bank.
I mean, it's a process that is going to take us at least the next 24 months in order to have also the global – the
global platform set in place, etcetera. So, we're very much concentrated on that, okay? And that's exactly what all
the focus of the group is today.
In terms of the Brazil asset quality, as you have seen – I mean, as you have seen, basically, first of all, I must tell
you that we have very strong revenue performance, okay? Solid evolution on cost, okay, flat quarter-on-quarter.
But we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality. Cost of risk is stable at 4.78%, and the more recent
vintages are performing well. And we don't have any signs of deterioration. It's very important that you
acknowledge what I explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the way we are
looking at the Brazilian portfolio, okay?
So, as I was telling you before, we used to grow in every single segment of the market. Today we're not doing so.
We're much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have. So you're going to see a much
better performance of Brazil over the next years because we're exactly doing so, all right? So, it's quite important
that you'll see that, and you're going to see basically that the outlook that we have towards the end of 2024, is –
and stable cost of risk versus 2023 around 4.6%. And as I said, I mean, with the new changes that we're putting in
place, etcetera, I think the vintages would perform much better than we expected, okay?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah, hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. A few clarifications. When you talk about earnings growth,
does that apply to current euros as well? I'm just asking, as you guided to 2% to 3% NII growth next year in
constant euros, and it might be a little bit lower in current euros, and that I would think would have to drive most of
the revenues to deliver positive jaws. And then a clarification on the rates. You mentioned 2.5% for Europe. Is that
what you expect for the full year then as well, or what is the average expectation for the year?
And then lastly on Portugal, so the net interest income, it declined significantly this year as you saw a big deposit
cost increase. Is this just a catch-up where [ph] the see (01:21:04) the competition and where do you expect
deposit cost to go in the future? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So, yes, we would expect fee income next year to grow mid-single digits with cost fairly flattish. So, yes, we would
expect revenue, operating income to actually increase next year. In terms of interest rates, well, we think 2.5% is
the rate that we expect by midyear. And then maybe one drop – one cut more in the second half of the year. So,
we do not see 2% as the terminal rate in Europe right now. Obviously, we'll see, but in our case, we are not as
negative as the market or positive depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates.
And then cost of deposits, Britta, you referred to countries. Which countries? Spain in particular? Sorry, I didn't get
whose – which country you were referring to. So, we will get back to you after the call. Carlos will give you a call
and clarify that.
But let me just very quickly – in Spain, obviously, the betas that we ended up this year – having this year were
much, much lower than the ones that we expected. So, we managed our cost of deposits pretty well basically
thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits. As rates come down, those parts of the
current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the Euribor, basically private banking, corporate banking, and
the large corporations, is adjusting downwards as well. So, going forward, we should see actually a positive
contribution from year-on-year deposit cost in Spain from 2024 to 2025.
Other euro countries, in Portugal, the situation is a little bit more extreme. So, in Portugal, we would expect NII to
actually go down a little bit more than in Spain next year because there, obviously the situation is a little bit more
extreme than it is in Spain.
Thanks, Britta. Next question, please.

Chris Hallam Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
I just have just one question left, and thank you for the color on 2025 NII rate sensitivity. So, it's a bit of a follow-up
question, but is the sensitivity to lower euro rates linear as rates move lower, or would the negative drag on NII be
larger on European rates if we start to move below your expectations or below 2% policy rates? You mentioned
earlier 2.5% at the midyear, 2.25% by the end of next year. Would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start
to get towards 2% or below 2%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Chris, thank you. It also depends on how steep or flat the curve is. A curve that flattens would have a more
negative impact on margins than a curve that remains steep. So, obviously, if rates go well below 2% and
approach 0%, obviously from 2% to 0%, the impact on margins is greater than from 4% to 2%. So, it's not linear.
But if rates stay between 2% and 2.5%, I think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of NII because
again, the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach zero basically and we will have at least that 2%
to 2.5% margin on the asset side.
Thanks, Chris. And the final question, please.

Q
Hi. Thanks so much for the time. Three quick clarifications, if I may. So first, trading income in Brazil has been
quite weak now. For a couple of quarters, it's been negative. Can you give any guidance there? Second, the
Corporate Center NII, should we expect a positive number in Q4? Or again, any guidance you could give? Third, I
heard you on the tax rate for the US. What does that mean for the group? So can you give guidance on the group
tax rate? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, [indiscernible] (01:25:45). In terms of the trading income, okay, it's in any case very small in the
context of Brazil, total revenue – in Brazil's total revenue. And it shall not overshadow the very strong operating
performance in the quarter and in the improvement on profitability, okay? The client-related trading income has
had a strong performance in Q3, okay? However, recent market volatility around the Brazilian real and the yield
curve led to an important deterioration in local assets during Q2, but also in Q3. But we have stabilized those and
I believe that the outlook would be much better. This is a challenging market environment and we've been
basically offsetting this going into Q3. And I believe Q4 is going to be much better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
NII for the Corporate Center. NII in the Corporate Center should gradually decrease because of the remuneration
of the liquidity that we have at the Corporate Center. So, you should expect NII to reflect the lower rates on the
liquidity that we hold at group level. And finally, the tax rate for the group, it should be fairly flat. Next year, may be
a touch below what it will be this year, but just marginally. So, for model purposes, I will use the same tax rate in
2025 than we will have in 2024. Same tax rate.
