Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to see the benefits of our diverse
business model, which helps us drive key points of our investment thesis, above peer loan growth, solid net
interest income and strong fee income contributions.
For the third quarter, we posted 15.3% average loan growth on a linked quarter annualized basis excluding PPP
balances. Asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs of just 7 basis points and a $5-million negative
provision for credit losses. Sentiment in our markets continues to move towards more normalized levels. While
supply chain dynamics and rising material costs weigh on businesses across our footprint, pricing and customer
demand led strong loan growth.
Turning to our third quarter results, net income was $94.5 million or $1.94 per share and pre-tax pre-provision
income on an FTE basis was $115.3 million or $2.37 per share.
Slide 18 shows primary drivers behind our results and I'll provide some high-level comments and then turn it over
to Ram for more details. Net interest income increased 4.3% from the second quarter, driven by strong earning
asset growth and controlled liability costs. Net interest margin was 2.52% versus 2.56% last quarter, impacted by
continued elevated liquidity levels, reinvestment rates, core loan mix and repricing.
We are working to deploy the excess liquidity as prudently as possible as the rate environment changes. While
reported non-interest income declined for the linked-quarter, it was largely driven by unrealized mark-to-market
adjustments in the equity holdings, including a $10.7-million swing to our Tattooed Chef position in the second
quarter.
We saw positive momentum in fund services income and bankcard fees, with increases of 8.5% and 7.1%
respectively. Trading and investment banking income fell during the quarter on lower trading volumes after an
extremely strong second quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, slide 24 has a snapshot of our loan portfolio, showing the drivers behind our loan
growth. C&I led the growth in average balances this quarter, as we continue to gain share across our footprint.
Prospects are recognizing us as a consistent, stable player in our markets. More than half of our commercial loan
growth came from new customers this quarter.
During the quarter, we saw some return of CapEx spending and while the growing number of middle-market
companies selling to private equity firms contributed to payoffs, we've had success in building relationships with
PE firms and are often able to participate in those purchases.
Average mortgage balances increased 7.4% from the second quarter to $1.8 billion. Funded mortgage loans for
the quarter were $236 million, including $30 million in the secondary market. Year-to-date, we've seen 53% in
secondary market mortgages compared to the same period in 2020. Top line loan production, as shown on slide
25, was $905 million for the quarter outside of PPP balance changes. Payoffs and paydowns were 5.9% of loans,
above recent levels.
We do expect acquisition activity among middle-market companies to continue, which makes estimating payoffs
unpredictable. However, we see a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter with opportunities across all verticals.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
On slide 26, we've updated our exposure to sensitive industries. We continue to monitor our hotel and senior
living portfolios, which stood at a combined $885 million at quarter-end, representing 5.5% of loans excluding
PPP. After analysis of mitigating factors including strong sponsors and guarantors, we feel approximately $419
million or 2.6% of loans were in closer monitoring. We've included this analysis again this quarter. However, as
the economy continues to improve, this will be less of a focus going forward.
Slide 27 and 28 show asset quality trends. I'm pleased with the reported 7 basis points of net charge-offs for the
quarter and as I mentioned last quarter, given what we know today and the quality we see across our portfolio, we
expect charge-offs to come in near our historical levels of 25 to 30 basis points for the full year of 2021.
You will see that non-performing loans ticked up this quarter to 0.59% of loans, in line with the third quarter of
2020. This increase was largely driven by one credit relationship. As we've talked about often, we'll see peaks
and valleys as we manage credit, moving them to watchlist or NPAs, but our historical track record has shown
limited migration to loss.
Moving to capital. We saw improvement in our already strong ratios with total capital of 14.17% compared to
13.84% in the second quarter. While we returned additional capital to shareholders through the increased
dividend payment announced in July, our top priority for use of capital remains supporting strong organic growth.
And as market conditions allow, we'll continue to look for opportunities to augment that growth with strategic
acquisitions. Along these lines, we recently announced a single branch acquisition with approximately $250
million in deposits in the Kansas City market.
Finally, we recently announced the formal launch of our family wealth offering. This is a registered investment
advisor, which focuses on providing entrepreneurial investment strategies, sophisticated tax planning, and
generational wealth guidance to families with significant wealth. We were already providing many of these
services within private wealth management and we decided it was time to formalize the offering, including hiring
and developing a dedicated team of investment professionals.
Additionally, UMB Capital Corporation, which holds our SBIC, will be part of our family wealth offering and will
focus on investment opportunities in private equity direct investments and other alternatives for our clients.
To wrap it up, we continue to see positive momentum across the company, and I'm pleased with our third quarter
performance and I'm excited by the opportunities we see as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond into
2022.
And I'll turn it over to Ram for a few comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Net interest income of $209.8 million represented an increase of 4.3% from the second
quarter. We amortized $8.8 million of PPP origination fees into income and the overall PPP contribution to the
third quarter net interest income was $10.1 million, compared to $12.4 million last quarter. At quarter-end, our
PPP balances stood at $318 million, down from $766 million at June 30. Approximately $9.3 million in amortized
fees remain at the end of the third quarter.
Average earning assets yields decreased five basis points to 2.65% due to a three-basis-point decline in security
yields and asset mix exchanges, including increased liquidity and a $659-million decline in average PPP
balances.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances now comprise 16% of average earning assets, compared to
14% last quarter with a yield of 30 basis points. This increased liquidity, along with core loan repricing pressure
and mix changes, drove the decline in net interest margin. We continue to deploy a portion of excess liquidity, as
well as cash flows from our securities book back into our AFS portfolio, driving an increase of $643 million in
average balances from the prior quarter and nearly $2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Looking ahead, our internal outlook for any Fed actions are in line with the current consensus for an early 2023
increase. We remain modestly asset-sensitive with more than 50% of our loan portfolio tied to short-term interest
rates and over a third of our deposits in interest rate demand deposits.
Actual experience when rates do rise will depend on a number of factors, including the pace and source of
liquidity reductions, overall size of our investment portfolio, mix shift within the deposit book, steepness of the
yield curve to include the 10-year treasury yield, and the number of rate increases as pertinent to our $1 billion in
pay fixed receive float swap portfolio.
As we've noted in our investment thesis, we believe that our ability to grow our loan portfolio through market share
gains, potential to redeploy our over $4 billion in excess liquidity, coupled with opportunities to rotate within our
earning asset base will also add to net interest income outperformance relative to our peers. Additionally, a few of
our fee income businesses benefit from higher interest rates such as 12B-1 money market fees in our corporate
trust business.
The portfolio composition and activity trends are shown on slide 29, and during the quarter, we had cash flows of
$375 million at a yield of 1.98%. We purchased $1.1 billion of securities that yielded 1.28%. Noninterest income
for the third quarter was $107.9 million, down $23.7 million from the last quarter, driven largely by market-related
adjustments. The market value of our investment in Tattooed Chef, TTCF, resulted in a $3.5-million unrealized
loss in the third quarter, compared to a $7.2-million write-up in the second quarter.
Additionally, as noted last quarter, our second quarter fees had included over $5 million in investment gains from
liquidity events on portfolio companies held at UMB Capital Corporation. Other drivers to fee income for the
quarter are shown on slide 22.
Noninterest expense trends are shown on slide 23. Expenses increased $7.5 million or 3.7% from the second
quarter to $208.9 million, driven by larger performance-related incentive expense and $2.7 million in operational
losses.
Our effective tax rate for both the third quarter and year-to-date was 17%. For the full-year 2021, we anticipate it
will be approximately 16% to 18%. Our tangible book value per share has increased nearly 10% during the past
12 months to $60.44 at September 30.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: I'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jared
Shaw, Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess, maybe first with the loan growth and outlook, you know, good growth on an average basis quarter-over-
quarter. I mean, I see the slide with the paydown/payoff activity. How should we be thinking about loan growth
going into the end of the year? Should we – you know, can we expect to see average growth from third quarter
with the impact of PPP rolling off or, you know, I guess, how should we think about the strong pipelines versus
some of the structural headwinds there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I think the news – this is Mariner. Morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think the news is similar to what we've already talked about, which is our top line growth. We expect to continue
to be strong. Payoff/paydown activity against that is an unknown – this last quarter was, I think, representative of
a buildup from the coronavirus from last year, where we had low cap rates and low interest rates and there's
some sales activity taking place within our – largely our CRE book. But otherwise, top line growth continues to
look strong. Obviously, ex-PPP, we continue to have the same trends as we always do with our loan growth.

Okay. And then, you'd mentioned some strength in – with PE from customers. Are you doing capital call lending
with them or what's the – what's the type of lending relationship that that's driving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we do do some lending into our fund services clients, but that's not really what we're referencing. We're
really talking more about M&A-driven PE lending. So, as companies in our portfolio or through relationships with
PE firms get bought or sold, we're participating in that acquisition debt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, looking at loan yields, do you think that overall we have – we sort of hit a bottom here
assuming a stable rate environment, or could there be maybe a little more incremental squeeze on loan yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Things remain very competitive. They always do. I don't know, Tom, if you want to add – we're near the bottom, I
suppose.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, no, I would agree with that. It's still a very aggressive environment and I don't expect that part of it to
change. If rates stabilize, however you define that, we may be near the bottom, but it's still always a competitive
environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Probably not a lot of downward pressure, but certainly remains competitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And just final for me. Any color you can give on that increase in C&I NPL, whether it's detail on the
sector? And then I guess what gives you confidence that the loss content could be low on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, it is, as we mentioned in the call, it is one credit. What I'd tell you is – which has been true for some time, I've
been in credit leadership at UMB for 25 years, as have the two other gentlemen on the call with me today, Jim
Rine and Tom Terry, and what has always been true about the way we manage credits is we're quick to take
action, quick to recognize trouble and quick to manage credits. And our history is very strong and long in not
seeing migration – much material migration from troubled credits to loss.
And we don't expect that to be any different on a go-forward basis, as there are peaks and valleys from time to
time, and typically very few credits. So, they're not really trends in any one – it's never a trend in an industry, it's
usually a particular credit or two.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Just a few questions on the fee income growth outlook. It looks like the fund services unit is continuing to post
pretty impressive growth over the last several quarters here and I appreciate the additional breakouts on slide 22
along those lines. So, just curious, as you guys maybe look out over the next several quarters, total fee income
growth has been in kind of the low to mid-single-digit range over the last couple of years.
Is that still a reasonable expectation to think about for 2022 and where do you see a lot of that growth coming
from across the overall composition of your...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Nate, this is Jim Rine. We have had great growth in the fund services area and half of that is coming from new
clients. Won't really give forward guidance on what we see for fee income. I can tell you though, through our
institutional business, our public finance area is up. We anticipate additional strong growth there through the rest
of the year. They're already having a record year.
Corporate trust is up 61% over 2020. We've continued to expand and add additional associates in that area and
we've made additional investments in our healthcare services area to expand our direct-to-employer network to
where we're expecting additional growth in the future there. Keep in mind, through our fund services, as well as
some of the other business, we are absent 12B-1 fees due to the rate environment and if you go back to pre-
2020, we had roughly $30 million in 12B-1 fees on a run rate. So, again, not providing guidance, but as rates do
tick up, we would see additional fee income in that – from that category as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And the driver is the backdrop for all of those businesses continuing to be strong. There's a lot of disruption in our
competitors with – in the fund services business. We've been benefiting handsomely from that disruption, and
we're a real strong player in the PE space. So, alternatives have been very strong, right, in this low interest rate
environment. Alternatives have been a very strong asset class. So, there's a lot of growth there both in formation,
as well as asset growth within our customer base.
So – and then, infrastructure and rates all are sort of headed – real rates are headed up, and the anticipation of
an infrastructure bill is speeding up activity in the public and corporate trust space. And as travel has recovered,
our aviation business is also starting to see some positive outlook. So, a lot of really good drivers as we look
forward.
And also, our mortgage business is – as we've talked in the past, we have a lot of runway across all of our
business lines and that's true for mortgage for us, too, even if purchase – or refi – even if the refi business slows
down on an industry-wide level, our business is so nascent that we have a lot of opportunity and runway just
within our customer base to participate in the purchase volume. And so we see some legs for our mortgage
business on a relative basis, even if rates rise and the refi business slows down, along with our card business for
– which is, for a company our size, is a pretty big business.
And we're starting to see some nice momentum in card spend, driving interchange revenue for us.

Got it. That's a very helpful color. Maybe just changing gears and thinking about the trajectory of the reserve over
the next several quarters, you know, you guys are back below kind of pre-pandemic relative reserve levels. As we
sit here today ex-PPP, how are you guys kind of thinking about the need to provide for additional growth going
forward kind of within the context of the charge-off outlook, you know, kind of remaining at that 25 to 35-basis-
point range going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Ram, you going to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we're still not at pre-pandemic levels. So on day-one or CECL number was 85 basis points
coverage and if you look at where we are today, we're close to 120 basis points, right? So, they're still at the
macro environment, and the Moody's forecast gets better. There's going to be pressure on the allowance
coverage ratio to go down further from where we are, but a lot of our provisions, typically to your point happens
because of the outsized loan growth that we have.
So, on that basis, I think our relative recapture of the reserve might be slower than peers because of that because
we continue to grow our balance sheet on the loan side. And so, that will be a good differentiating factor if you
will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Makes sense, and maybe just one last one for me. Any additional color on the operational loss in the other
expense line item here in the third quarter – and I assume that doesn't recur going forward, but [indiscernible]
(00:23:08) just appreciating yet? Any additional color on the driver there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's something that will, you know, I think you see this on other income statements. It just bounces
around a little bit. It's not regulatory. It's not a regulatory loss. It's just a typical kind of business or business
operating type losses that we will bump into from one quarter to the next based on our business activities and
breadth and depth of our business.

Ram or Mariner, the deposit growth has been just off the charts. I'm interested in kind of – kind of an outlook for
deposit flows, particularly noninterest-bearing. How much do you think is sustainable versus a little bit transitory?
Because those numbers are pretty strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
It's a great question and when you get the answer, will you give us a call? No, we're – we've benefited – I think
one of the reasons ours is outsized is a mix of business, right. So, we have a large commercial and institutional
business. So, the question – so, that's certainly a big driver, which would be less transitory, right? So, the growth
of our assets servicing business, the growth of our new aviation trust business, the coming back of our regular
corporate trust business, and 12b-1 fees, which is – so, those kind of comments around corporate trust and public
finance business picking up and a rising rate environment, all of those things would be the non-transitory part of
the increased levels of liquidity on our balance sheet.
If you just look at the pre and the post sort of numbers, the range, right, we've got an additional $4.5-some-odd
billion on our balance sheet. The question, right, the million-dollar question for everybody is, is it a $4.5-million in
excess transitory liquidity or something less? We certainly believe that it's less than that because of the growth in
our business lines and the complexity of our balance sheet and income statement.
Certainly, there is some excess liquidity on the balance sheet, but we have internal debate ourselves really about
how much there is. So, I know you're looking for more than that, but I think a lot of it is going to be driven by the
complexity in all of the institutional businesses adding core balances. But there's certainly some excess liquidity
on there.

your peers this quarter, just inflationary wages, pressures to run the business. I'm interested how you're thinking
about retention and the cost to retain and also recruit. Thanks.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Another great question, right, as we're all sort of feeling our way through this, the pressures of work-from-home
and the [ph] reach-ins from the coasts (00:26:47) and just the competitive landscape for employment. I think it's
early, right, to tell – to understand some of the longer-term implications of coming out of COVID and some of the, I

think, more permanent implications of the way we've been working in the last couple of years. But I would say that
we have seen some wage inflation and that we do not believe that is transitory. You can't un-ring that bell.
But I think from a competitive landscape, we have a great culture. We're not losing people. Our voluntary turnover
rate and turnover rates in general are not much different than they were prior to the period we've gone through, so
we've been watching that. And so, we don't feel like there's any signs on the turnover side where we have been
able to maintain and hold the people that we have competitively on the hiring side.
That's the biggest challenge because everybody is looking and everybody is in need. But again, we feel pretty
good about the culture and the strength of kind of the consistency of our company as we look to hiring.

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, Chris, it's Jim Rine. The one thing that we've also been just dealing with, I think most of our peers are
dealing with too, is just getting our mix and flexibility correctly. I think that's what associates are really looking for
in the workplace right now and that's something that we're addressing and putting a lot and being very thoughtful
with also. As much as the wage inflation, it's just what the new work environment looks like and that's where
you're going to see a lot of changes in the industry, quite frankly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And we want to be a thoughtful leader in that space. So, we're not going to dig our heels in. We're going to
make some real changes and adapt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then – thank you for that. The last one would be, Ram, on the PPP. Can you just remind us the fee
that were in the quarter and then what's left?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it was $10 million in the quarter, Chris. That includes both the origination fee [ph] and the (00:29:04)
interest income. We still have $9 million of fees left on the PPP program on balances of about $320 million at
quarter end.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey. Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
The utilization rate, can you talk about where utilization rate was here at the quarter-end and how you – you
know, if you expect that to change here anytime soon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, it was at 32% at the end of the quarter, and it ranges from 29% to 35%. And I would say that the way to think
about it is, you know, the average is a low – for us is low 30s. And, you know, if you think about a environment
where there's a lot of liquidity in the system, my take for the industry is it's likely that that liquidity gets spent first
before we would see something on the higher end of our range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got you. Okay. And then, you know, looking at the average balances in loans, pretty good growth there in the
quarter, but the period end didn't show the same. Was there some accelerated payoffs or paydowns near the end
of the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Tom Terry. As Mariner mentioned earlier in his comments, we're seeing a greater amount of payoffs
in our commercial real estate book, principally, due to low cap rates, a low rate environment, they're either being
refinanced in the non-recourse market or there are a lot of just outright sales of commercial real estate properties.
And so, we are seeing a greater amount of that this year and certainly in the third quarter than we've seen
historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
But that point-in-time question, though, that's just a – that's literally just a point in time. The growth, I would – I'd
pay more attention to the averages...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas S. Terry A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Correct.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
And, Dave, [ph] because 2025 (00:31:25) has the roll-off/roll-on on that, and you can see those numbers in there
and as a percentage of loans, as Mariner and Tom both alluded to, was a little elevated at 5.9% of total loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I might add that – it wasn't asked, but it's something we're pretty proud of. We're going to have a new tear-sheet
coming out in a week or so on our community development and our ESG efforts. We've spent a lot of time on it.
We're really proud of the things we're doing. As a matter of fact, I'd say ESG is the new term really for some
things that we as a company have always really cared about and we're pretty excited about that. So, keep an eye
on it. You can go to our website and see our community development statement and within a week or so, you'll
see our new tear-sheet for where we're making sure we're getting recognized for a lot of the things we've been
doing by detailing them in the statement.
We're doing some real neat things. We're rolling out here in the summer a down-payment assistance program to
reach into LMI neighborhoods and help lift people up and help increase homeownership. And in our fourth quarter
expenses, we think that if things continue the way they have for us this year into the fourth quarter, we're likely to
share some of our profits with our communities in the fourth quarter as we have been doing.
And, anyway, we're real proud of what our team is doing and what our company is doing to make a difference and
– in the communities we're serving and would love for you all as investors to take a look at what we're doing on
our website and keep an eye out for those efforts going forward. So, thanks, for everybody joining today.

Kay Gregory
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, UMB Financial Corp.
Right. It looks like we have no further questions. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. The replay will be on our
website shortly, and as always, you can contact UMB Investor Relations at 816-860-7106 with any follow-up
questions, and we appreciate your interest and time. Thank you.
