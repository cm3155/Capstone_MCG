Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you, Miles. Good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter earnings
before turning the call over to Dale, who will review our financial results in more detail after I discuss our updated
2024 outlook. Tim Bruckner is back by popular demand, our Chief Credit Banking Officer Regional Banking, will
join us for Q&A. Western Alliance earned $1.75 per share in the second quarter and demonstrated the bank
building momentum as our repositioning strategy has transitioned into earnings growth strategy. Growth will be
accompanied by an elevated risk management architecture as well as enhanced liquidity profile and capital base.
Thoughtful balance sheet growth in Q2 drove an upward inflection in net interest income from increased liquidity
deployment into higher yielding earning assets.
We generated outsized core deposit growth of $4 billion and HFI loan growth of $1.7 billion or 14% on an
annualized basis from Q1, which we expect will exceed our peers. CET1 capital remained at 11%. Deposit growth
in excess of guidance lowered our HFI loan-to-deposit ratio by 2 points to 79%. Our liquidity profile was also
bolstered by a $1.7 billion increase in securities and cash from quarter end, which allowed us to pay down
borrowings by $634 million and growth of deposits by $222 million.
Our differentiated national commercial banking franchise uniquely positioned us to generate sustained deposit
growth from various business lines and deploy this liquidity into attractive no to low loss C&I commercial loans
where we have deep segment and product expertise. Asset quality overall is normalizing, which we expect total
classified assets declined $33 million in the quarter to 93 basis points. Net charge-offs were 18 basis points of
average loans, the majority of which relates to the Downtown San Diego office property we identified on this call a
year ago, when it migrated to substandard.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
I think it's also important to note the renewed earnings power of our franchise strengthens our ability to
consistently compound capital and generate risk adjusted earnings growth to support the Q3 and Q4 earnings
ramp we have previously communicated. For the quarter, net interest income grew 39% annualized, driven by
higher average earning assets and an expanding NIM. Annualized deposits and HFI loan growth of 26% and
14%, respectively, pushed net interest income higher. Higher ending balances compared to average balances
establishes a higher jumping off point to increase net interest income going forward. In total, pre-provision net
revenue adjusted for the FDIC special assessment in Q4 and the rebate in Q1 is 22% annualized, and is poised
to continue its upward trajectory.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Dale for a review of our financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. During the second quarter, Western Alliance generated pre-provision net revenue of $285 million,
net income of $194 million, and EPS of $1.75. Net interest income increased $58 million from Q1 to $657 million
due to higher average earning asset balances and yields. Non-interest income of $115 million decreased $15
million quarter-over-quarter, primarily from lower income from equity investments as well as softer mortgage
revenue. Mortgage loan production rose 14% and interest rate lock commitment volume increased 24%, while the
gain on sale margin compressed by 3 basis points.
Non-interest expense was $487 million. Deposit costs of $174 million drove the quarter-over-quarter increase to
find attractive loan growth amidst an elevated rate environment. Net interest income growth exceeded the
increase in deposit cost by $21 million this quarter, as mortgage warehouse deposit growth continues to benefit
from market share gains amidst industry obstruction in the first quarter.
We believe Western Alliance's warehouse lending group has become the premier bank in this space. Considering
our enhanced liquidity profile, we are well-positioned to proactively lower the ECR cost of these deposits as the
first rate cut approaches. Provision expense of $37 million resulted from loan growth above industry trends as well
as $23 million of net charge-offs.
Securities and cash increased $1.7 billion quarter-over-quarter and allowed for a further $634 million reduction in
period end borrowing. Loans held for investment $1.7 billion to $52.4 billion, while deposits increased $4 billion to
$66.2 billion at quarter end. Finally, tangible book value per share continued its expansion, rising 3% or $1.49 to
March 31st to $48.79. Loan growth is primarily driven in C&I categories of $1.9 billion, which offset continued
purposeful reductions in residential and consumer loans of $179 million and construction and land of $69 million.
Mortgage warehouse, tech innovation, and fund banking loan growth drove loan mix diversification while we
reduced our CRE concentration. On a year-over-year basis, C&I loans have grown $5 billion.
Deposit growth of $4 billion was led by mortgage warehouse and followed by growth in Juris Banking and our
digital consumer channel. Non-ECR, non-interest bearing deposits have posted three consecutive quarters of
growth and we are encouraged by the traction our diversified deposit channels are gaining, which should continue
to drive growth in deposits that carry no direct or imputed interest costs.
Turning now to our net interest drivers, the yield on home securities increased 21 basis points to 4.87%,
recapturing two-thirds of the prior quarter's decline from the HQLA build conducted in the first quarter. Completing
our accelerated liquidity, build related to larger balance sheet repositioning efforts allowed us to add more higher-

yielding securities. Our liquidity position remains solid as unencumbered, high quality liquid assets were 53% of
securities in cash, compared to 52% last quarter. Securities and cash in total held steady at 26% of assets.
HFI loan yields increased 2 basis points due to asset repricing benefits from the ongoing higher rate environment.
Back-weighted loan growth momentum led to period end loan balances exceeding average balances by $1.7
billion. The cost of interest bearing deposits were 6 basis points higher from the first quarter, while the total cost of
funds declined 3 basis points to 2.79% due to a deposit mix shift toward non-interest bearing and a pay down of
short-term borrowings.
In aggregate, net interest income increased $58 million from higher average earning asset balances, which
includes a full quarter's impact of the deployment of liquidity into securities towards the end of Q1. As well as a 3
basis point decline in the cost of liability funding. Net interest margin expanded 3 basis points from the first quarter
to 3.63% from the $5.9 billion increase in average earning assets as the growth was funded more from non-
interest bearing liabilities this quarter.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was 52%. Net interest income growth was the primary contributor to
this improvement. Deposit cost increased $37 million from higher average ECR-related deposit balances. As
noted earlier, these higher balances funded commercial loan growth and purchased floating rate securities that
propelled strong net interest income growth. Other operating expenses were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter.
As Ken mentioned earlier, asset quality continues to normalize. Total classified assets declined $33 million in the
quarter to 93 basis points of total assets. Non-performing assets were essentially flat from last quarter. Just under
two-thirds of NPLs are paying as agreed when excluding the San Diego property that Ken cited earlier, which we
expect to move into other real estate.
Turning to slide 12, quarterly net loan charge-offs of $22.8 million or 18 basis points of average loans. Most of the
charge-offs this quarter were attributed to the San Diego Office Property. Provision expense of $37.1 million cover
net charge-offs and added reserves in concert with loan growth. Our allowance for funded loans increased $12
million from the prior quarter to $352 million. Total loan ACL to funded loans ratio of 74 basis points was
unchanged and covers 97% of non-performing loans. Our focus on growing loans in inherently low loss categories
has resulted in a reserve level lower than some peers.
Slide 13 shows our ACL lift from 74 basis points to 132 when incorporating the effect of credit-linked notes, which
insulate us from the first loss on covered credit as well as loans to loan no-to-low-loss categories like equity fund
resources, our low LTV residential portfolio, and mortgage warehouse loans. More specifically, for the credit-lined
notes, we have in our possession $447 million from insurers that we can deduct first losses on an $8.9 billion
mortgage portfolio, leaving us with zero loss risk.
For our residential loans not covered by insurance, these mortgages have an LTV at only 62% at origination,
which is likely lower now to borrowers and FICO scores of 766 and debt-to-income ratios at 33% and have
incurred no losses. For EFR capital call loans and mortgage warehouse credit, not only have we never had a loss,
but other banks have had pristine credit experience as well.
We include this in a lock-up for the ACL because we have a large proportion in our book in these very low risk
categories and other institutions. Our reserve level is supported by our low realized losses. We've consistently
discussed our proactive mitigation strategy, along with our low advanced lending discipline is important –
ultimately [indiscernible] (00:11:33) credit exposure.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
On slide 14, we present a historical look back on migration performance, which shows over the last three years,
WAL ranks fourth or approximately one-third of the peer median on net charge-offs to average non-performing
loans. Over the past decade, we ranked number one at only 9.6%. The table on the right shows our allowance
covers over 7 times the last 12 months net charge-offs inclusive of the second quarter and places us in the top
third among peers.
Our ACL also covers our last four years of net charge-off, which is the duration of our loan book, by 4.3 times,
which is the second best in the peer group during this timeframe. Our CET1 ratio remained 11%. Our tangible
common equity ratio to total assets moved down approximately 10 basis points from Q1 to 6.7%, as asset growth
and low risk categories exceeded organic capital accretion from higher earnings.
I think it's helpful to consider other sources of loss-absorbing capital when evaluating our balance sheet. Viewing
our CET1 capital ratio with AOCI marks and loss reserve as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, we ranked in
the top third of our peer group. Notably among the six peers on slide 14 with higher ACL to net charge-off ratios
over the last 12 months, only two have higher adjusted capital ratios than WAL. Finally, tangible book value per
share increased $1.49 from the end of Q1 to $48.79 from retained earnings growth, which equates to the
annualized growth rate of approximately 13%. Our consistent upward trajectory and tangible book value per share
has outpaced peers by 7 times since the end of 2013.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Thanks, Dale. Following our Q2 results, I would like to update the bank's 2024 guidance as follows. A
building pipeline provides clarity to continue loan growth at $1 billion per quarter in a safe, sound and thoughtful
manner. Our current loan-to-deposit ratio provides flexibility to selectively make more loans as opportunities arise.
For the full year, loans are expected to grow $4.5 billion compared to the $4 billion previously; and deposits are
expected to grow $14 billion, which is $3 billion above our previous forecast. Deposit growth in Q3 is expected to
be $2 billion.
Turning to capital, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain at or above 11%, capturing the forecasted increase in loan
volume as organic earnings growth supports rising loan and investments. Net interest income is now expected to
grow 9% to 14% from the Q4 2023 annualized jumping off point. Our rate outlook includes two 25-basis point cuts
in the back half of the year. NIM is expected in the 3.60% area for the remainder of the year, and Q2 ending loans
balance versus the average for deposits and loans provides continued net interest income momentum for the
back half of the year.
Non-interest income should increase 15% to 25% from an adjusted 2023 baseline level. Our upward revision
reflects growth in commercial banking fees as well as incremental improvement in other fee segments. Non-
interest expense inclusive of the ECR-related deposit costs is now expected to rise 9% to 13% from an
annualized adjusted Q4 baseline of $1.74 billion, primarily from the greater ECR-related deposits which fund
attractive balance sheet growth and grow earnings.
In aggregate, these factors should enable WAL's sustained PPNR to provide the organic capital to support
balance sheet growth and the CET1 target, while offering us the ability to maneuver around various economic and
operating environments. Asset quality is normalizing from historic lows, and net charge-offs are expected to
remain low by industry standards at 15 to 20 basis points of average loans for the year.

At this time, Dale, Tim and I will take your questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jared Shaw with
Barclays. Jared, please go ahead, your line is now open.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Maybe just, looking at the loan growth, you've had great loan growth, obviously this quarter. As we go
forward, any change in sort of the geography of where that's coming? You look at the CRE portfolio that's been a
little bit under pressure, should we think that it still is coming from the same primary areas of C&I, or could there
be expansion into some other areas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thanks. For the year and also for the quarter and also year-over-year, majority of our growth has been
coming in the C&I categories. And again, that's in no or low loss loan segment. And I think we're going to continue
to move forward in that manner. I think what you can expect for the rest of the year is to see a continuous
downward movement in our residential loan portfolio as you saw this quarter. I think you'll find CRE overall will be
relatively flat. We will look for opportunities to finance. We do like pockets of financing in the construction land and
development. Most notably, we've always talked about this. Our lot banking segment will provide opportunity. But
the short answer, I guess, is that mostly it's going to come in C&I. Note financing, warehouse lending are the two
areas that are going to lead the way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then just on the fee income side, are you assuming – I guess, you're still assuming that the
Fed funds cut flowing through to help with mortgage banking there as well, I guess what's the trajectory we could
expect there following that, those two cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Right. So for our forecast, we have a rate cut in September and a rate cut in December. We are forecasting a
modestly declining mortgage income, mostly because the Q4 rate cut won't get – it comes in a quarter that's
seasonally low in terms of volume. So we would expect to see pickup from the rate cut in terms of mortgage

volume, really to follow into 2025, more so for the back end of Q4. So, basically, Q4 is a seasonally low quarter to
begin with.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Let me start in the ECR deposits. Can you just give more color of what drove such strong growth and was the
increase in the interest expense on those purely tied to the growth or did the rate, the effective rate basically rise
as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks. Two questions there. So first, the growth came in warehouse lending, all right. And what we have found
from the first quarter disruptions in the market that Western Alliance's warehouse lending group has become
really the premier platform to hold your escrow accounts on and also come to us for warehouse lending and MSR
loans. So that volume is coming in for that reason.
Also, we've had a number of market share gains. New clients coming in, that's one type of market share gain. And
existing clients that we currently have, have given us more of their deposits. So that's the kind of push on that
segment, which carries a higher ECR. Now with that liquidity, we've been paying down and we'll continue to pay
down our short-term borrowings.
And to your other question, we do have several initiatives that we are launching to kind of work on the rate and
see if we can push that rate downward as we go into Q3 and exit Q4.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Okay. That's helpful. Ken, in terms of the deposit growth getting lifted again, were you guys just very
conservative? Is growth coming in much more than you guys expected? And it's funny, when we look at the
second half, you did $11 billion of deposits in the first half. I think you're guiding like $3 billion in the second half. I
don't know if there's some seasonality in the fourth quarter, but are you just being very conservative here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So let's talk about the seasonality first. In warehouse lending, we see an outflow of deposits every Q4. So some of
the deposit growth in Q1 of 2024 was the return of those tax escrow payments that were made. And usually, that
runs between $3 billion and $4 billion that flows out in Q4, so why I'm saying $3 billion net growth. Then you can
see that we're accounting for $3 billion to $4 billion that's going to fly out the door or flows out the door at the end
in the year. Where we're getting it from is – what's interesting is, for this quarter as an example, 58% of our
growth really came from our deposit-only channels. And so we've launched a number of them as you probably
know, this is escrow services, corporate trust, Juris Banking, and of course, HOA, which started about 12 years
ago when I first joined the bank, and that's where those deposit vertical growth is coming from.
In addition, our consumer lending or consumer digital platform has really taken off and we're doing quite well
there. And we had another strong quarter in Q2 when we saw our deposit growth drawing $673 million. So since
we actually launched the consumer digital channel, I'll give you a number as of today because our folks are very
proud it, they are [indiscernible] (00:22:39). But inside of a year-and-a-half, that channel has moved up to about
$4.5 billion and just provides another channel for us that we didn't have before at a cost point or price point, which
is rather consistent with our commercial pricing, all right. So we don't have a consumer base as you know, so we
don't have to worry about cannibalizing our consumer base and having them move from low rates to higher rates
here. It's consistent with what's happening in our commercial book, and it provides another challenge for us to
use, almost as a challenger channel to other deposits that are coming in to hold the line or try to push those
deposits down over the long-term.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. I guess maybe as we think about lower rates and the NII outlook, Dale, if you don't mind reminding us,
including the ECR-related deposit cost, how should we expect sort of NII to trend if the rate cuts from September
and December continue to 2025? Is that positive overall for the NII and NIM inclusive of ECR or negative? And
secondly, what determines whether you end up at the 14%, which is the 9% for this year on NII outlook?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So, yeah, regarding your first inquiry, Ebrahim, yeah, so we're fairly neutral on an aggregate of net interest
income plus deposit expenses. And then just Ken was alluding to earlier with the discussion about our mortgage
operation, we're not sure that that's really going to kick in until we get a little more than one for the fourth quarter.
And then two moving into the beginning of 2025, a little more rate relief on the mortgage rate environment. So we
feel comfortable where we are. And I think, within the relative range that we're going to see later this year, we're
going to be fairly neutral on, I'm going to say, PPNR-related to interest rate movements, both inclusive of interest
expense and deposit cost.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And I'll take the second part of your question, which is what factors influence how we will perform in the second
half of the year. I think you can expect Q3 that you'll see net interest income continue to rise. And then in Q4, you
can expect net interest income more or less to be flat to Q3. And what are the factors there? One is our continued
upward movement in loan growth. That's very important. And overall, our total revenue should, in Q4, should be
relatively flat to Q3. So we are making up some of the decline in yield by having higher volume in loans and also
working other – some other fee-based channels that we have. And then we've been working those fee-based
channels, and developing them over the last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And I guess just a second question, Ken. I do want you to address from a credit standpoint, these are really
low numbers, I get it. But it's been overhang on the stock for three or four years. Just talk to us outside of things
going through the pie, your visibility in terms of credit quality outlook over the next 6, 12, 18 months. Where do
you anticipate some weakness, drivers of losses, ex all the things that you have said are low loss kind of pieces of
the loan book? Would appreciate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I'm going to let Tim take that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Thank you. So, Dale, I think did a nice job of really covering some key measures of success in the portfolio
in his discussion. So I'd start by saying we're very pleased with our portfolio performance. And then when we
when we look forward, we've taken every opportunity to describe. We focus on early elevation and early
resolution. So we really take the forward-looking approach when we view troubled loans, portfolio performance,
and our ACL. So our forward estimates that Ken talked about of 15 to 20 basis points includes all current
valuations, anticipated value based changes to carry assets that may default, and are based on the market
conditions that we're living in today. So we update these values and assess each exposure always on an ongoing
basis.

Hey, just to follow up on the credit conversation. So the guide implies some increase in net charge-offs for second

Kenneth A. Vecchione A

So we update our appraisals on our non-performing loans approximately every six months, and we're getting
more clarity. Some of these markets don't have a lot of transactions. And so, as that comes in, we saw something
in terms of the San Diego property. We took that immediately. You see that here, that put us a little bit above the
15% kind of upper limit that we had as of our first quarter guidance. And so, we expanded that kind of 15% to
20%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just following up on that San Diego loan. Could you expand on kind of the update there, news about
being foreclosure and kind of your plan to deal with asset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Look, we're moving to foreclosure. We took the appraisal charge, as we described. We are going to work to
reposition the asset, increase occupancy, and then we'll also look to sell the building when we have the
occupancy level at a higher level than it is today. So it's what you would expect anyone to do. Think of it as you
going out and buying a property, what would you do to enhance the value. That's what we're going to be doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just lastly, really leaning into some mortgage warehouse deposits, any thoughts around
concentration levels? I know it's continuing to creep up there, but how do you feel about the concentration of your
total deposit base, particularly within mortgage warehouse?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Yeah. So there's a good news and interesting story here, okay? The good news is, as we continue to become one
of the premier platforms in the industry, we're seeing all those deposits come in. That's great. We are also getting
market share wins. That also is great. The flip side of that is a higher concentration. And so, you've seen our
HQLA grow. And so, we are not putting all those – all that liquidity out to finance loans, but rather holding that
liquidity on our balance sheet and making a smaller spread. What we will do over time is work with our clients to
work through our repositioned current pricing models, given the liquidity that we have.
So a year ago, there was a premium placed on liquidity. And people said, if you want my liquidity, you have to pay
out for it. Well, things have changed a little bit now. And as a premier platform, I think there's a discount that
people have to take when coming to our platform for our service levels, so the ability to do multiple things, not
only handle their escrow deposits, but also provide financing. And we're going to see if they value it that way. And
so, we're going to work in that particular segment to scale down or push down some of the rates that we're
paying.

of those projects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we've indicated in the past that we're approximately three-quarters of the way through with complying
with where we need to be to tip over $100 billion. I wouldn't extrapolate too much from our growth rate for the past
few quarters and say, make that trajectory in terms of where we're going to cross over $100 billion. We still have
at about $6 billion of borrowed funds, about $6 billion of broker deposits, and we're going to be paying that down

in a more accelerated fashion. So you're going to see our total assets grow at a slower rate than what you've
seen for the past few quarters.
That said, though, we're on track with this. We're developing whatever plans we need to finally get there. We do
not see a significant step variable cost in front of us to be able to get over that hump, except for potentially what is
related with the TLAC, total loss-absorbing capacity. We need to do more debt there. But even in that situation,
based upon [indiscernible] (00:34:01) prototype, which I think is being revised, we have until 2028 to kind of get
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then, maybe just following up on Ebrahim's question around rates. I guess, how would the cadence of
rate cuts potentially impact your ability to lower ECR costs and benefit some of the other mortgage related
activity, i.e., if we just have one rate cut or if the rate cuts are spread out, how would that affect your ability to
maybe lower some of those ECR-related expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Look, most importantly, the [indiscernible] (00:34:41) is broken on rates. So there's no places where others can go
and get kind of substantially higher rates as we had when we were in an expected higher rate environment, if you
go to Treasuries or some of these other products, and be a competitor against deposit rate. Plus, the situation
within the banking space has become somewhat more relaxed as well.
However, these are entities that control significant amounts of dollars. And so they can get something at or near
what would be kind of a market rate of interest. But as I said earlier, I mean, we're in a position that we can, I
think, start to kind of use our leverage with our strong balance sheet, with our strong delivery system within this
space that we think we're now kind of the premier player to be able to affect a more significant cost mitigation
strategy going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
But a simple answer is, as rates move, total ECR rates of the Fed cuts 2025 in September. You'll see that flow
through starting immediately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then maybe if I could just leave one more question in around mortgage banking. There was a
comment in the release on maybe elevated loans held for sale and doing more conforming mortgages. And then
in the deck, part of the rationale for the higher fee income guide was that margins are firming up. It looks like gain
on sale margin actually declined a little bit here. But are we starting to reach an equilibrium kind of with the new
production? I guess, what are the expectations for gain on sale margins in the context of the 2Q decline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So gain on sale margins in Q1 were higher than Q2. In Q2, you saw mortgage rates move back up above
7%. They're firming now and we are optimistic, but we don't have it captured into our forecast yet that as more
people get comfortable that rate cuts are coming and with the shortage of supply and housing in the market, that

more people will start returning. You're seeing a little pickup now in refi activity, while we're looking forward to the
purchase activity to really drive us. But from a forecast point of view, we're going to wait to see that flow through
our P&L before we capture it in our go-forward consensus outlook.

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just on the margin, held up a little better than expected up 3
bps. I think you had guided previously down 10 and that's despite kind of loans earning assets coming down.
Updated thoughts on kind of the near-term margin outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we did pop it up 3 basis point. And again, with the excess liquidity, we did two things. A lot of excess
liquidity came in towards the back end of the first quarter. So we were able to deploy average earning assets that
help. And then also we're paying down our – and working hard to pay down our short-term borrowing. As I said in
my prepared remarks going forward, Q3, Q4, you could see net interest margin holding very close to where we
are now in the 3.60% area, and that includes the two rate cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Yeah. Got it. And then just shifting gears to credit, any color on the uptick in special mention this quarter?
What drove that increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Really, it's a balance with the prior fourth quarter to last year. So we're down from where we spent most of
the year last year, slight uptick, and it's just part of our early elevation as part of our ongoing review processes. I'd
say that it was idiosyncratic or specific deal situations that brought credit into view. And then we will quickly, as we
always do, work through those to move them up or out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, I would note that whether you're looking at the special mention ratio or total dollars, Q2 is still below the
trailing four quarter averages. So nothing out of the ordinary in that special mention move.

Operator: Our next question comes from Bernard Von Gizycki with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line
is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys, good morning. So just a question on your interest rate sensitivity disclosures. I believe you might have
made some changes in the 1Q disclosure versus the 10-K given more granular assumptions on the deposit betas.
So, for 100 basis points decline of rates, you showed NII down about 7% at $331 million. But wonder if you could
update that at $630 million and believe NII could come in better given higher expected loan growth and benefit
from wholesale deposit repricing. So just wanted to see if you could provide some puts and takes there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, okay, so net interest income should come in higher because of what you just said. But the volatility around
that on a different interest rate assumption, again, this is the shock that we show. It's probably going to be fairly
similar to what we showed you in the first quarter. Not a whole lot of difference there. And again, I mean, we look
at it really looking at net interest income plus the delta that we're going to see in deposit cost, which is going to
have kind of the opposite effect. And so the net between them gets to a fairly stable, I'll call, net interest related
items in PPNR, combining of those two elements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then, just separately, just on the fee income, just a question on this. I know the equity investments
were about $4 million, which were much lower in the previous two quarters. And I think there there's some
benefits on one income in the prior quarters. Just wondering if you can provide any color and expectations from
here going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
That's a difficult thing to – for us to really, prognosticate, and so we have equity positions in more than 500
companies and which ones pop or which ones close is a process on how that looks. I mean, there is some
correlation with maybe M&A activity that's been a little restrained for reasons that I think everyone is aware of. So
maybe that's been a factor here. I can't really project what it's going to be in third and fourth quarter, other than we
don't see any really change going on. So maybe we've got the parameters of where the higher or lower areas
could be and maybe somewhere in there. But there's nothing going on there that we think is going to be
magnitude change either better or worse, respectively.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q

Operator: Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. Dale, when I look at your guide and the ranges in your guide, it would seem that if you're at the
midpoint of NII, you'll probably be at the midpoint of the expenses or at the high end. Is there any – is there a
scenario where you're perhaps at the high end of expenses and maybe the midpoint of NII, or should we just think
about them whatever our assumptions are, they should be kind of consistent?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I wouldn't put too much interdependence on the elements in here. There is a correlation, obviously. If net interest
income moves up, what does that mean is that a relatively higher – either rates overall maybe, fewer rate cuts,
and/or better growth and that can affect what was going on the expense side. But in total, I mean, I think these
parameters are reasonably pretty fair. I mean if anything were – maybe we think we're going to do a little better on
the non-interest income side, maybe toward the upper end of that range. But the others, I think kind of a midpoint
is fairly on target with what we would consider.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on the – just going back to the balance sheet strategy. You talked about
the expense build and HQLA and TLAC – the capital target, the 11% plus that you've been with for the better part
of the year. Is there a scenario where that changes in your view, materially either way, now that you're kind of
through the worst of the crisis and we're a little bit more confident in the outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Chris, you blanked out. We missed the first part of that question. Can you repeat it for us, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, sure. I guess, just closing the loop on the $100 billion investment discussion. Is there a scenario where your
11% CET1 target, I guess, would move materially one way or the other I guess is the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So you want to keep the 11% as a target more like a floor that we've said before. Growth that we're generating
from earnings are going to be used to fund loan growth. So the progression from the CET1 level 11% upwards is
going to be slower. It's not going to be as rapid as you've seen in the last six or seven quarters. And if you're
asking is there a stock repurchase program in our immediate future, the answer would be no. Because unlike
many of our peers, we have a higher degree of comfort regarding loan growth coming from these low or no loss
loan categories that we think over the long-term will propel the company forward at a faster rate for EPS. So that's
what we plan to do.

Operator: Our next question comes from Samuel Varga with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the corporate trust business. Could you give us an update
on where things stand and sort of where are the pipelines? You'd mentioned that the investment grade rating is
the catalyst here. Can you just give a broad update on where that business is at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So I think we're the only bank – I'm pretty sure we're the only bank that has had positive ratings actions, if
you want to call them that, from either Fitch or from Moody's. So we're both on outlook positive. Obviously, our
ratings are not where we believe they should be, but we think that is encouraging in terms of direction. We have
gotten certainly good traction in our corporate trust operation. And we've tag-teamed with our corporate finance
group and deliver a combined product set for CLO administration, which we think has been helpful. So we're
really quite optimistic of what that looks like. While I would be glad to have a ratings increase from both of those
entities, we don't think it's necessary for us to continue to grow strongly in that category. We have more than $0.5
billion in deposits there presently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So I was on the road last week with the corporate trust group and our lender finance group. And combining those
two together, when calling on clients, has put a pipeline of deals ready to close now, do not mean these deals
have been mandated to us of about – there's like a pipeline of 30 clients that got to close. And so, putting those
two things together has been very, very valuable, where we have the ability to make investments or lend on the
lender finance side. And as we do that, we expect the mandate on the corporate trust side. But what's more
importantly is the corporate trust program that we built. We took a few people from a large money center bank.
After chatting with them during the interview process, I said what is needed to make this program successful? And
it really was rebuilding the technology, the architecture that's currently out there, and a higher level of customer
service.
And I can tell you from the five or six calls I had last week, that's exactly how our clients feel about us, that we
have the better technology in the industry and the service levels are meeting their expectations, is actually not
exceeding them. So it's pretty exciting for us. We're going to see how this thing moves forward. This is a build. So
our corporate trust group in terms of deposits should do between $150 million to $200 million on average a
quarter. And as our name gets out there and we continue to expand the group, I would hope for bigger and better
things as we move into 2025. But right now, very, very pleased with that activity.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that update. And then, just trying to switch back to ECR deposits for one last question on that.
Dale, if I understand correctly, the mortgage warehouse deposits are sort of pulling up that paid rates. Is it fair to
assume that if 4Q seasonality comes through and those deposits partially flow out that that alone will be enough
to reduce the ECR rate, regardless of whether we actually get cuts or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure, sure. So first off, I mean, as Ken alluded to earlier, we're expecting 100% or a little bit above deposit beta
or, I would say, funding costs beta on the ECRs as rates come down. And so, if you get that effect and then
coupled with an expected outflow seasonally, not related to relationships in the fourth quarter, those should have
a combined effect going from, say, a rate cut at their meeting in September into the fourth quarter. Lower rate and
lower balances, you're going to see a drop in non-interest expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Which gives us the confidence level that our EPS, as we move through Q3 and into Q4, will be on an upward
trajectory, which is what we've been communicating since the beginning part of the year.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
But in the warehouse lending group, we've seen a couple of competitors recently drop out of the market. One has
said that they're selling loans. One sold loans. And what's most important to our clients, and maybe this is really
when people always say, why is it that you guys grow while others don't? Well, first is that we're a commercial
bank and we're national. And we just don't stick to a region. So that's one answer. The second answer is we don't
move in and out of markets, and people can count on us to always be there.
Now, terms and conditions may change because economic conditions change, but we don't pull out of the market
and then jump back in. And our clients remember that especially around warehouse lending, where those lines
sometimes can get shut down rather quickly and larger banks can make a determination whether or not they want
to be in the business or not. And that's a little bit more serendipitous. For us, we want to be in the business, and
we let the economic terms and operating conditions tell us what it is we need to charge and how to be there to
support our clients. And I think that's one of the reasons why we've become the premier go-to platform in that
segment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
There's been a lot of discussion on interest rates. What do you guys prefer from a rate perspective? Do you want
a couple of cuts? Do you want more than a couple of cuts? What's ideal for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Oh, boy, that's a question for me and my therapist. But for the most part, if rates keep coming down at a faster
pace, what we would look for is the mortgage fee income to rise and that we can bring in volume on the loan side
to help offset some of the rate decline that you would see on our loan portfolio. And that would be our approach.
Dale, do you have a different opinion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No, I agree. I the other thing I would say is, is there's been a little bit of a, we can still say this, right, the Chinese
water torture on CRE in particular related to a higher rate environment where debt service cost is just – has
become burdensome over time and it's whittled away at DSCRs, debt service coverage ratios over the past few
years and LTV as cap rates decline. So relief on that I think would give the whole industry a little bit more
headroom in terms of NPA materialization and issues related to maintaining strong asset quality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Fair enough on that. And then, Dale, just a quick one on the provision. Given the updated charge-off
guide and the growth guide, I think it suggests a relatively stable provision. Am I looking at it the right way or is
there something else to consider?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I think that's fair. I would say, however, I mean, look, we've had good loan growth. We've had our loan-to-deposit
ratio on a marginal basis for the past couple of quarters has been very low. We kind of climbed into our comfort
level in terms of our liquidity profile. So if we had higher loan growth, how CECL works, of course, that demands a
load up on provisioning cost irrespective of what earnings you've been able to draw from that in the present
period.
