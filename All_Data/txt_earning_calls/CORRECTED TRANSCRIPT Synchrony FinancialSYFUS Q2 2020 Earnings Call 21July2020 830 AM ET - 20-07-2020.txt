Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. When we last spoke, the world was facing a global health crisis and
broad economic disruption. Sadly, while we saw some bright spots and began reopening here in the in the US,
we've seen a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus causing continued disruption to our lives, businesses and
economy. In addition, following more senseless loss of life within the black community, our country is awakening
to the need to meaningfully address racial injustice and equality. Both challenges are difficult, emotional and take
hard work to address. I'm proud of how Synchrony continues to successfully manage through these
extraordinarily challenging times.
Our decisions are guided by putting people first. With COVID, we are focused on the health and safety of our
employees and their families, providing support for our customers and helping our partners get back up and
running. In the fight for equality, we are implementing new actions to increase diverse employee talent at all
levels; grow business relationships with diversified and small businesses; investing in diverse markets and
working with our partners, customers and employees to address deeply-rooted gender and racial inequality. With
our values as our guide, we are resolute in addressing these challenges and emerging a better company and
country.
Now I'll turn to the second quarter results on slide 3. Earnings were $48 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This
included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the CECL implementation this year which was
$483 million or $365 million after tax and reduced EPS by $0.53. The pandemic has impacted results this quarter.
Brian will provide details on the trends later in the call and I will provide a high-level overview here.
On a core basis which excludes Walmart and the Yamaha portfolio, the impact of COVID-19 drove a 3%
decrease in loan receivables, a 7% decrease in interest and fees, a 13% decrease in purchase volume and a 5%
decrease in average active accounts. The efficiency ratio was 36.3% for the quarter.
As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact in our balance sheet,
deposits were down $1.5 billion or 2% versus last year. This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit
growth given the excess liquidity we have. We have held direct deposits at last year's level of $53 billion. Our
direct deposit platform remains an important funding source and we will continue to focus efforts to make our
bank attractive to depositors.
As we navigate the day-to-day of this new environment in which we all find ourselves, we are also acutely focused
on the future of our business. During the quarter, we extended several programs and added new partnerships
which you can see on the slide. We also executed a successful launch of the new Verizon program. We are very
proud of this program and we work closely with Verizon to create a unique, robust rewards program for their
customers that use simple and easy tools to apply, buy and service the Verizon Visa Card. This card includes a
compelling value proposition, giving consumer wireless customers the ability to save on their monthly Verizon bill
through rewards earned on everyday purchases and freedom to use those rewards towards Verizon purchases
including bill payment and the latest phones and accessories. Further, the Verizon Visa Card is truly responsive to
what consumers want right now, a contactless, frictionless and digital-first experience. We are also excited about

our new program with Venmo and continue to partner with them to launch their new program which we anticipate
will occur later this year. During the quarter, we also returned $128 million in capital through common stock
dividends.
We are pleased with the strength of our business and we are well-positioned to continue to help our cardholders
and partners navigate through these challenging times. We continue to remain highly focused on digital
innovation, accelerating our data analytics capability and creating frictionless customer experiences which are key
to the success of our programs and winning new partnerships.
I'm going to turn the call over to Brian Doubles to discuss some of the key highlights in this area.

Brian D. Doubles
President, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Margaret. As we've discussed previously, the digital transformation has been well underway for a number
of years now, and in many cases the pandemic has accelerated these trends that were already in motion. It's
clear that many of these new trends and our consumer behaviors will be permanent and there will be a new
normal specifically as it relates to the digital shopping experience and consumers' increasing demand for
contactless commerce and payment options. Studies indicate that consumers are changing their shopping
behavior and that contactless payments is becoming increasingly important as indicated by the data on the slide.
The fact that consumers are seeking and rapidly adopting contactless solutions is creating greater demand for our
partners to deliver safe and efficient contactless experiences.
We are well-positioned to address these changing behaviors and have quickly responded to this need with
dedicated resources and investments to support our partners and cardholders during this time of rapid change. As
you know, we have been investing in our digital assets and capabilities and we quickly recognized in the early
days of the pandemic that we would need to move even quicker to help support our partners and help them
accelerate their digital transformation. We quickly reviewed every strategic project in the business and reallocated
resources and Agile teams to accelerate our efforts on key digital initiatives. We believe we are uniquely
positioned to meet this moment and its lasting effects. Data shows that the vast majority of consumers plan to
stick with their digital behavior beyond the pandemic, and we are prepared to help our partners position for the
new reality of today and into the future.
Driving digital sales penetration continues to be a key to our success with both existing partners and with our
newer programs. In Retail Card, digital sales penetration was 48% in the second quarter and digital applications
were approximately 70% of our total applications, 14 percentage points higher than last quarter. The mobile
channel alone grew 43% compared to the same quarter last year excluding Walmart. Further, more than 60% of
total payments made on our cardholders' accounts are done digitally.
We continue to provide partners and customers with increased digital options from applying on their own devices,
provisioning a new card into their digital wallet, transacting with contactless cards and making payments. We
believe customers will continue to adapt to what makes them more comfortable. Many of our partners have been
with us for decades. We have been there to help them grow their businesses and we are now here to help them
adapt to the challenges in the new environment. We are accelerating our efforts to provide our partners and their
customers with innovative services and products they can use during this time of disruption.
Our investments in our digital assets have proven extremely valuable in helping them to serve their customers
and drive sales. This is a testament to our agile structure which is helping deliver real-time solutions and our
dedicated teams who are tirelessly working to support our partners and their customers.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Allow me to briefly echo what Margaret said earlier about the dual
crisis facing our nation. We are determined to keep our employees safe and help our partners and customers be
successful during this time. We've been more committed to driving meaningful change in the fight for racial
equality inside our company and in the communities which we serve and live. With the backdrop of
unprecedented uncertainty and volatility, I've never been prouder of our company and our people, the values we
live by and our commitment to inclusion that is the heart of who we are.
Now turning to our financial results for the second quarter. I'll start on slide 5 of the presentation. First, I want to
cover some of the trends we are seeing from the impact of COVID-19 from a purchase volume standpoint and
thought it was important to provide an update on performance of accounts who received forbearance.
Slide 5 shows year-over-year purchase volume growth for the total company for the quarter as well as purchase
volume by sales platform dating back to January. Purchase volume growth was strong for the total company and
by platform with double-digit growth from January through mid-March. In the second half of March, as government
restrictions increased, travel, entertainment and event activity were significantly curtailed and a high number of
non-essential retail stores closed. There was also a significant curtailment of elective healthcare services. As a
result, purchase volume declined significantly, decreasing as much as 31% in the first half of April for the total
company.
In looking at the full month of April by sales platform, Retail Card declined 21%, Payment Solutions declined 41%
and CareCredit declined 60%. CareCredit was impacted the most with a significant decrease in spending for
elective and planned procedures in dental and medical services during this period. Retail Card performed better
due to the higher concentration of digital volume as well as having programs that benefited from an increase in
spending for essential products such as grocery, supplies and home-related expenditures.
As consumers became more comfortable under stay-at-home orders and initial reopening phases in May and
June occurred, we saw a recovery in purchase volume as we moved through the second quarter. In the second
half of June, overall purchase volume increased 3% over the prior year and each of the three sales platforms saw
a significant recovery in purchase volume from the April trough.
Looking at some of the other key business drivers for the quarter, new accounts declined 36% and purchase
volume by account declined 8%, reflecting the impact of the crisis as well as underwriting actions we took as the
pandemic's impact progressed through the quarter. We did see a 4% increase in the average balance per account
due to a combination of portfolio mix from our digital and retail partners as well as lower than usual volume in new
accounts.
While we are encouraged by these trends, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty which lies ahead when the
stimulus measures and industry-wide forbearance actions abate. However, our business mix, including a strong
digital component as well as diversification of segments being positioned to benefit from spend in areas such as
home-related expenditures as well as veterinary services will likely dampen some of the effects of the economic
downturn. The ultimate impact is still largely uncertain given the duration and magnitude of the pandemic is still
largely unknown at this point.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Moving to slide 6, we highlight the impact and performance of accounts that were granted forbearance compared
to accounts not in forbearance. Through June 30, we granted forbearance to a cumulative total of approximately
1.7 million accounts or $3.2 billion in account balances at the time of forbearance. We have seen nearly 70% of
these accounts leave forbearance through June 30, leaving approximately 500,000 accounts or $1.1 billion in
account balances remaining in forbearance. Through mid-July, these numbers have been relatively stable. Of the
accounts that enrolled in forbearance, 92% were either current or less than 30 days past due, so relatively small
number of accounts for 30-plus days past due.
When you look at some of the performance characteristics, you will see trends that are not surprising. Credit line
utilization is higher and payment rates are lower. In terms of impact on financial performance, in total, we have
waived $47 million in late fees and $20 million in interest through the end of the second quarter.
From a trend perspective, we are seeing a substantial decline in the number of accounts enrolling in forbearance
from a peak in late March to early April where we saw nearly 40,000 accounts enrolling per day. This dropped to
less than 10,000 per day in June. Looking at payment trends for June, nearly 70% of accounts that enrolled in
forbearance were making payments. 8% of those accounts paid their balance in full, another 61% were making
payments, leaving 31% of the enrolled accounts not making payments. From a credit perspective, 56% of the
enrollees had a FICO score of 660 or below at the time of enrollment.
For accounts that have exited the forbearance program, their credit performance is slightly worse than other
similar accounts. Accounts off forbearance have a three times' increase in the entry rate into delinquency.
However, given the limited time the accounts have been off forbearance, it is not clear at this point how those
accounts will ultimately perform in delinquency.
It should be noted that while the performance is generally weaker than similar accounts, it has not had a material
impact on our 30-plus delinquency measures which improved during the second quarter. I will cover our
delinquency performance later in the presentation. We will continue to closely monitor the performance of
accounts in forbearance as well as the accounts that have exited forbearance and stand ready to provide
assistance to impacted cardholders.
Moving to the second quarter financial results on slide 7. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of
$48 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the
implementation of CECL this year. The increase was $483 million or $365 million after tax which reduced EPS by
$0.63.
COVID-19 impacted our growth in several areas as noted on slide 8. On a core basis, which excludes the
Walmart and Yamaha portfolios, loan receivables were down 3% and interest and fees on loan were down 7%.
On a core basis, purchase volume was down 13% and average active accounts were down 5% from last year. On
slide 7 (sic) [8] (00:16:38), we've included dual and co-branded card purchase volumes and loan receivable
balances to provide the level of diversification we have through these products. Dual and co-branded cards
accounted for 34% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and declined 22% from the prior year. On a loan
receivables basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 4% from the prior year.
As I noted earlier, the impact of COVID-19 accelerated as we moved through March and April, but we did see
some encouraging signs in these metrics as we moved through May and June. We would also note that while
we're seeing positive trends in these metrics, the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic is still largely
unknown and it remains difficult to provide a more precise forecast of the impact at this point.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
RSAs decreased $86 million or 10% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.0% for
the quarter, starting to reflect the impact that COVID-19 is having on the program's performance. The provision for
credit losses increased $475 million or 40% from last year. The increase is primarily driven by the reserve
increase for the projected impact of COVID-19-related losses and the prior year reserve reduction related to
Walmart that totaled $247 million. The reserve build for the second quarter was $627 million and largely due to
the projected impact of COVID-19-related losses. Other income increased $5 million.
Other expense was down $73 million or 7% primarily due to the cost reductions from the Walmart sale, the lower
purchase volume and average active accounts experienced during the quarter and reductions in certain
discretionary spend. These decreases were partially offset by higher operational losses, expenses related to our
COVID-19 response and charitable contributions.
Moving to our platform results on slide 9. As I noted earlier, the sales platform were impacted by varying degrees
due to COVID-19. In Retail Card, core loan receivables were down 4% with the COVID-19 impact being partially
offset by strong growth in our digital programs. Other metrics were down driven by the sale of the Walmart
portfolio and the impact from COVID-19.
Although Payment Solutions was impacted by COVID-19, strength in powersports resulted in core loan
receivables growth of 1%. Interest and fees on loans decreased 8% driven primarily by lower late fees. Purchase
volume decreased 19% and average active accounts decreased 3%. We signed a number of new programs and
renewed key partnerships this quarter as noted on slide 3. We continue to drive growth organically through our
partnerships and networks and added close to 4,000 new merchants during the quarter. These networks, along
with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse which now stands at approximately 30% of purchase
volume excluding oil and gas continue to build a solid base of business for the future.
CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 in the second quarter. But as I noted earlier, we did see some
encouraging sign in the trends as the quarter progressed as providers began to provide discretionary and planned
services. Receivables declined 5% and we did see growth in veterinary specialties that partially offset the
negative impact of COVID-19. Interest and fees on loans decreased 4% primarily driven by lower merchant
discount as a result of the decline in purchase volume which was down 31%. Average active accounts decreased
2%. We continue to expand our CareCredit network and the utility of our card as we added over 2,000 new
provider locations to our network during this quarter. The network expansion has helped to drive the reuse rate to
60% of purchase volume in the second quarter.
I'll move to slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 18%
from last year primarily driven by an 18% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the
Walmart portfolio, the impact of COVID-19 and lower benchmark rates. On a core basis, interest and fees on loan
receivables decreased 7%. The net interest margin was 13.53% compared to last year's margin of 15.75% largely
driven by the impact of COVID-19 receivables, an increase in liquidity, fee and interest waivers and lower
benchmark rates.
The loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets mix declined from 83.9% to 78% driven by the
higher liquidity during the quarter. This accounted for 113 basis points of net interest margin decline. The impact
of fee and interest waivers from forbearance that I noted earlier accounted for 24 basis points of the net interest
margin decline, a decline in loan receivables yield primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of the
Walmart portfolio. This accounted for 101 basis points of the reduction in our net interest margin.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
The investment securities yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 32 basis points
of net interest margin decline. These impacts were partially offset by a 58-basis point decrease in total interest-
bearing liabilities cost to 2.15% primarily due to lower benchmark rates and lower deposit pricing. This provided a
48-basis point benefit to our net interest margin.
Next, I'll cover key credit trends on slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with our
delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.13% compared to 4.43% last year and the 90-plus
delinquency rate was 1.77% compared to 2.16% last year. If you exclude the impact of the Walmart portfolio, the
30-plus delinquency rate was down approximately 90 basis points and the 90-plus delinquency rate was down
approximately 10 basis points compared to last year.
Focusing on net charge-off trends, the net charge-off rate was 5.35% compared to 6.01% last year. The reduction
in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the Walmart sale and improving credit trends. Excluding the
impact of the Walmart portfolio, the net charge-off rate was approximately 20 basis points lower than last year.
The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.52% post-CECL implementation.
Excluding the effects of CECL, the allowance under the ALLL method would have been 7.91%. The reserve build
in the second quarter was $627 million under CECL and $144 million under the ALLL method. The overall reserve
provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of COVID-19 which accounted for most of the reserve
build in the second quarter.
In summary, the second quarter trends continue to be solid, forbearance providing a degree of benefit in
delinquency trends. We do expect the overall credit trends will be impacted by COVID-19 as we move forward.
Moving to slide 12, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were down $73 million or 7% from last
year to slightly under $1 billion for the quarter. The decline was driven mainly by the cost reductions from
Walmart, the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the quarter and reductions in
certain discretionary spend. This was partially offset by higher expenses attributable to operational losses and
certain expenditures related to our response to COVID-19. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 36.3%
versus 31.3% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by higher expenses attributable to operational losses,
certain expenses related to our response to COVID-19 and charitable contributions. Excluding those impacts, the
efficiency ratio would have been 260 basis points lower or approximately 33.7%.
Moving to slide 13. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we've
continued to build liquidity during the second quarter. While we think it is prudent to have higher liquidity levels
given the level of uncertainty and volatility, we're actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity.
As a result of this strategy, there's a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined $1.5
billion compared to last year. We also reduced the size of our securitized and unsecured funding sources by $3.9
billion and $1.3 million respectively. This puts deposits at 80% of our funding compared to 75% last year with
securitized and unsecured funding each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. While we slowed
overall deposit growth in the second quarter given our excess liquidity, we held direct deposits at last year's level
of $53 billion.
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities was $28.0 billion which equated to 29% of our assets; this is up
from 22% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the
benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March which has two primary
benefits. First, it delays the effects of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, loss for
the portion of the current period provisioning under CECL to be deferred and amortized with the transition
adjustment.

With this framework, we ended the first quarter at 15.3% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 100 basis points
above last year's level of 14.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.3% under the CECL transition rules compared to
14.3% last year, reflecting the preferred stock issuance last November. The total capital ratio increased 200 basis
points as well to 17.6%, also reflecting the preferred issuance. And the Tier 1 capital ratio plus reserve ratio on a
fully phased-in basis increased to 26.5% compared to 20.8% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a
result of implementing CECL and the preferred stock issuance.
During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Last quarter, we announced that given
the current economic uncertainty and being as prudent as possible, we made the decision to halt further share
repurchases until we have greater visibility on the magnitude of the impact that COVID-19 will ultimately have on
the economic environment. We will continue to evaluate this as we move forward. Overall, we continue to execute
on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with
diversified funding sources and operating with strong capital and liquidity levels.
In closing, given the number of uncertainties that exist regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19
pandemic and the countering impacts of actions such as the CARES Act, payment assistance for consumers and
other government and regulatory actions may have, it remains very difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this
time and provide specifics around key outlook drivers.
As we did last quarter, I want to provide a framework to help you consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers.
Regarding loan receivables growth, COVID-19 had a significant impact on purchase volume particularly late in the
first quarter and into the second quarter, and then as businesses reopened we saw positive trends and
improvement in purchase volume. As long as businesses remain open, we expect this trend to continue. But the
increase in COVID-19 infections we're seeing nationally and the responses to this will influence whether the
recovery continues and may result in further volatility as we move forward.
What continues to help our trends and resiliency is the growth in digital, diversity inside our platforms and
financing in essential areas such as home and healthcare. We'll continue leveraging our capabilities and expertise
to help our partners and providers during this difficult period. This overall direction in purchase volume will be a
key influence in our receivables growth rate.
Our net interest margin has been impacted by a number of factors including the buildup of liquidity in our balance
sheet and reduction in the size of our receivables, the reduction in benchmark rates resulting from Fed rate cuts
on our receivables and investment security yields and impact of forbearance in terms of interest and fee waivers
for a temporary period of time. As we move forward, we'll continue to look at means to deploy our excess liquidity
and impact of forbearance should abate. We do expect a benefit to net interest margin from higher interest
income and fees generated from an increase in the number of accounts that will evolve in our loan receivables
portfolio and continued lower interest expense.
Finally, it should be noted we also share the impact on revenues and funding costs through the RSA. Regarding
RSAs, in addition to sharing the net interest income impacts, we also see an impact from higher credit costs. The
ultimate amount of the credit cost impact and timing will be determined somewhat by the expected deterioration in
credit as stimulus actions and industry-wide forbearance assistance abates. While we expect an increase in net
charge-off rate as the year progresses, it should be noted the overall portfolio, quality and credit trends as we
entered this pandemic were strong and continued to improve in the second quarter. Also, the tools and
capabilities we have highlighted previously will help us better navigate the economic impacts from COVID-19.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Finally, we also believe higher recoveries will ultimately materialize, partially mitigating the impact of higher
losses. While we continue to expect reserve builds to be elevated as we move forward, until we gain more
visibility into the duration and severity of the current pandemic and the impacts from stimulus and industry-wide
forbearance, we cannot provide more specific guidance. Once we have greater visibility, we'll be in a better
position to define the expected net charge-off and reserve build expectations going forward.
Regarding the efficiency ratio, activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we would look to
mitigate some of the impact through expense reduction opportunities. We have undertaken a comprehensive
review of our operating expense base and are formulating a set of actions to rightsize our operating expense as a
result of the reduction in mix in our loan receivables portfolio. Fundamentally, the business remains strong and is
resilient and we're going through this situation with a strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity position.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Margaret.

Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. As we have said, the ultimate
impact from this crisis remains difficult to quantify right now, so I will reiterate that we believe we have an
advantageous position to navigate this unprecedented pandemic. We are well-positioned from a credit
perspective given changes we have made since the financial crisis in addition to some of the more surgical
modifications we've made in recent years and that we continue to make considering the current operating
environment. We have a partner-centric business model and agile approach to all our operations and
investments. Our digital capabilities and assets has helped us win important digital partners and are another vital
tool to help our partners shift volume to online and mobile channels. We are focused on execution today with an
eye towards the future, making investments, building capabilities, launching programs and making the
fundamental changes necessary to emerge from this pandemic in a stronger position.
Thank you for participating on the call today and I hope you and your families stay healthy and safe. I'll now turn
the call back to Greg to open the Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from
KBW, we have Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, good morning. I'm glad you guys are doing well. I guess my first question is on pre-provision earnings. I
know there's a lot of things that Brian Wenzel, you laid out. But as we think about loan growth, understanding it's
a little bit a moving target but the purchase volume stats are encouraging, how should we think about pre-
provision earnings going forward? Was the second quarter a trough or do you think that there's more pressure
ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Good morning, Sanjay. So first, if you start out with volume, again, we saw positive trends as we moved
through the quarter from troughing in the early part of April through a plus 3% in the end part of June. I'd say as
we moved into July, we're probably about a negative 2 which kind of reflects some of the uncertainty and volatility.
But I would say right now, it's generally in the plus or minus 2% to 3%, and we think about that trend really is a bit
uncertain as we move through the quarter and how the pandemic and the effects on the economy move forward.
Payment rate has continued to be strong. But obviously, as you think about that from a stimulus perspective and
an industry-wide forbearance perspective, they may burn off here which will ultimately hopefully bring down the
payment rate. So as we think about receivable growth, it is a little bit uncertain as we have multiple factors going
different ways.
If you think about the margin of the business, really, we think this is probably a trough. As receivables have
moved down close to $5 billion sequentially quarter-to-quarter, we tried to burn off as much of that liquidity as we
can. We'll continue to try to burn that off. So the impact that we saw in the quarter which was just from the higher
liquidity, the 113 basis points, that should begin to burn off here in the third quarter. And again, as we move
through into the fourth quarter and internally next year, the forbearance impact of 24 basis points should, for the
most part, be burned off here in the third quarter now. So I think from a margin perspective, we kind of hit that
bottom and will trend up from there.
With regard to credit, obviously we've been strong in credit. Delinquencies are 90 basis points better ex-Walmart.
They haven't really been impacted on forbearance, and we can talk about that later, but forbearance hasn't had
that impact. It's really when we start to see those trends move through. So I think from a charge-off perspective,
we don't expect to see charge-offs really rise here; maybe the latter part of 2020 but more into the first half of
2021.
The expenses, we're going to again continue to really take an active approach to manage some of the
discretionary expenses. As I outlined in our prepared remarks, we're taking a comprehensive review of expenses
and really look at more structural things in order to get more cost out really to reflect the change in our platforms
as a percent of mix and our portfolio mix. So we would expect to come back with a series of actions that we can
really undertake in the latter part of 2020 into 2021 to reduce the expenses and get that efficiency ratio back to
where it would normally run. So again, I think there's some positives here coming out. But most certainly, the
11

uncertainty relative to purchase volume and really payment behavior patterns are the key for us for the back half
of the year.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then my follow-up question is on the reserve build. I think I heard you, Brian, say that it's a little bit of a
moving target still in terms of the credit quality migration going forward. But as we think about reserve builds
under a macro assumption that you've used, do you feel like you're comfortable with the build that you've done
and, provided nothing changes on that macro assumption, you don't expect future reserve builds? Maybe you can
just talk about that macro assumption, too. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Sure, sure. Let me start with the macro assumption, Sanjay. So we run multiple economic scenarios and really
formulate a base case and then we have a couple of downside scenarios and what I would say is an upside
scenario. So to just ground ourselves, when we looked at the first quarter, we used a model that essentially had
unemployment peaking in the second quarter around 10%. But again, as I said, the important parts are really
where you exit 2020, 2021 and 2022 where we had unemployment really at the end of 2020 at 7% and then 4.5%
in 2022. Obviously, if you look at assumptions today, they have deteriorated from that March 31 date.
So what we have done is we stepped off and we took the Moody's baseline model as our starting point even
though they've issued revisions in June and July that were slightly positive that we stay with the Moody's baseline.
And then effectively, what we did is we modeled onto that unemployment, we essentially redistributed
unemployment to take into account forbearance, to take into account stimulus. So at the end of the year, when
you think about our unemployment exiting 2020, it's 11.5%, 9.3% in 2021 and 6.4% in 2022, and we don't really
get back to an unemployment rate under 5% until 2023. So I think as you think about how we thought about the
macroeconomic environment, we thought about a slower recovery with potentially a greater impact on
unemployment.
The key thing for us will be how that unemployment really develops and whether or not you see a greater, what I
would call, higher income unemployment come into the mix later in the year as you move maybe out some lower
income people, so that will be a variable.
As you think about the reserve build then, it really comes down to, for us, a platform mix because obviously we
have platforms that attract a higher CECL reserve in CareCredit and Payment Solutions, so some of this is going
to be mix-related. So under CECL, we expect the reserves to be elevated on a normal basis. So again, I think
we've taken the best guess of the macroeconomic environment as it stands today, but it's really going to go back
into delinquency formation and loss formation as we exit 2020.

Operator: From Credit Suisse, we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. And I was hoping maybe to start, you could just talk a little bit about – you mentioned, Margaret,
the partner-centric strategy and how that might impact the second half of the year. You've launched the Verizon
Card, you got kind of Venmo. How should we think about what Brian was talking about in terms of kind of volume
levels currently with that partner-centric activity in the second half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So I'd say there's really three parts, right? The Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit, I'd say in
each case, each platform is operating fairly well. We've really tried to stay highly engaged and close to our
partners throughout this process. So as you mentioned, we were able to launch Verizon which I joke around here
was the first launch in a pandemic. That launch went extraordinarily smooth in terms of the execution of the
launch. Now, obviously Verizon is still working through how they open all their stores. So what Brian talked to
earlier about our ability to be fully digital I think was a big win for us because we've been able to launch and have
a successful launch and feel good about the program and its growth trajectory given the environment we're in
right now.
I'd say on Venmo, there's a lot of work going on. Obviously, we've had to switch to everything being agile and
virtual, and that process has really been phenomenal and the teams are executing that plan. And as you know, in
both cases, we're really trying to make this experience a fully digital, integrated experience for the consumer
which I think lessens the burden on brick-and-mortar as we continue to fluctuate between what's open and what's
closed, so we feel positive about that. And ensuring that we're originating the right accounts; we put a lot of work
into the front end of our business on fraud because that is one area that I think everyone in the business is seeing
a lot of pressure on. And we feel good about the tools and techniques that we've been able to put in place to
really launch this program.
So that's really on the Retail Card side. I'd say on Payment Solutions and CareCredit, a couple of things. We're
working very closely with these partners. We actually held a number of seminars held particularly in our
CareCredit business, helping the offices reopen. We shared our plans. We had the folks that are working on the
reopening of our offices although we haven't reopened yet, kind of the things that we have put in place, the
procedures. And so what we're trying to do is integrate in such a way that we're helping them deal with the
pressure they have to deal with as they come back online as well as ensuring that we're providing them with the
digital tools that they're going to need as they shift from totally brick-and-mortar to more online particularly in our
Payment Solutions platform. We have a whole team there working on a new digital POS for that platform which
we think will be a big win as we end the year, beginning of next year.
So one of the things we've done is step back strategically and really look at what we were working on and really
have doubled down really across the whole digital aspect of our business to ensure both digitally from a data
perspective we're helping those partners as they continue to reopen and deal with some of the ins and outs of
closing and opening and making sure we can deliver from a digital perspective for their consumers. So highly
integrated, lots of conversations and feeling really good about our performance so far.

Yeah. Moshe, the other thing I'd add in the CareCredit platform. We have exciting announcement of
AdventHealth. So when you look at the health systems component, not only do we have now Kaiser Permanente,
Cleveland Clinic, Advent, the ability to get into the path there and to really help our consumers as they manage
their medical bills in this point in time is terrific. And we're building really a different type of network in that
business and working closely with them in order to get that up and running with a handful of other really good
health systems across the country.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I'd say what's been amazing is the teams were able to execute these deals in the middle of the pandemic when
many of these institutions are having a lot of challenges themselves. So it goes to show the relationships that
we've built pretty and our credibility in the industry so far of us being able to engage at that level during this
period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Sounds like you've become more important to them. Brian, just a quick follow-up on the reserving question
from before. 12.5%. I mean, the average life of your portfolio is something in the – I don't know if it shrunk in this
period but you used to think it was like 1.7 to 1.8 years. Can we infer anything in terms of where you might be
thinking peak loss rates would be in 2021 as a result of that 12.5% reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Moshe, I think it's very difficult to kind of infer that rate because we haven't seen any of the trended data
really come through and it's going to really dictate where we see some of the pressure build. Most certainly, when
you think about our CareCredit and Payment Solutions, those are longer-dated assets with promotional financing.
Obviously, we can control the origination on the front end of that, but that book will take a longer period of time. I
think the positive thing is that if you look at the Retail Card book, obviously we've exited the Walmart portfolio
which has a higher loss content and really have gotten into what I'd say is some faster-growing, more stable
portfolios. And I think when you look at the FICO mix, our FICO mix for the first quarter now on a sub-660 basis is
300 basis points better and only 24% of the total.
So we feel good about where we are. I think hopefully we use the macroeconomic assumptions that are hopefully
the worst case. But again, we'll continue to monitor those as we move forward. So until we see some of that
trended data and the delinquency formation happen, it is a little bit tough to give you that guidance for 2021 at this
point.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is, Brian, I think you mentioned that, and tell me if
I'm wrong, that the actual purchase volume on the digital channel in Q2 was up year-over-year. So, A, did I hear
that right? And second, maybe within that channel, can you talk about the key influencing factors? I mean, is most
of this coming from e-commerce platforms like Amazon and PayPal or is it more distributed? Maybe just a little bit
of color on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, sure. This is Brian Doubles. Why don't I start on that? The online sales penetration rate in Retail Card was
48%. And just to give you a little bit of historical perspective, that was running in the mid-20% range just a couple
years ago, so we feel really good about that growth. The national average for e-commerce sales typically has
been running in that 15% to 20% range, so that gives you a good basis of comparison. So I definitely feel like
we're over-indexing in that channel. I think it is broader certainly this year than just Amazon and PayPal. When I
think about the pandemic, really this has just accelerated the digital transformation that was already underway. So
as Margaret kind of highlighted, what we did very early in the process is we went through every strategic project in
the business and we said, okay, how can we best support our partners by helping them accelerate their digital
transformation?
So we went project-by-project. We redeployed agile teams. We worked with all of our partners, big partners, small
partners, providers in CareCredit to help figure out how we could best support them. So we put more resources,
more investment, shifted things around to things like digital apply, digital buy, accelerating a lot of projects that
were already in place. So it is more broad-based than just the fact that we've been trying to engage more and win
more programs in the digital-only space. We're really helping our omni-channel partners transform their
businesses and figure out how we can best support them in that transformation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
That's very helpful. Thanks. And then Brian Wenzel, I guess another follow-up question on the provisioning. I'm
just trying to – I'm trying to determine if we can understand maybe your perception of the different risk factors tied
to those seeking deferrals versus those who haven't. And with that, is there a way that you could discuss the
provision this quarter? Maybe how much of it was a specific provision for the cohort that has sought deferrals
versus a general provision just tied to uncertainty and risk in the overall environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Great, John. So let me start with the forbearance impact. I think we tried to give you some color really with
regard to the accounts that went into forbearance. So the accounts entering, only 8% were delinquent at the time
they went into forbearance. And while they had higher credit line utilization and payment rates, what we've seen is
as they come off forbearance they performed a little bit worse than their kind of cohorts in the portfolio but not
dramatically worse, so they have roughly a three times entry rate into delinquency. But when you look at the
accounts that come off forbearance and look at the amount that's already in our delinquency, less than 6 basis
points is in delinquency today relating to accounts that were in forbearance. And if you took that whole 8% and
rolled that through, it's less than 20 basis points, so forbearance has not had an impact for the $2 billion that has
rolled out at this point.
15


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Obviously, we'll have to see how that develops. We're in the early stages of those accounts really performing off
of the program. But we're encouraged by the number of people that – the 8% that's paid in full and the 61% that
are continuing to make payments. So I think forbearance for us clearly has benefited our cardholders. What's
unknown to us is the forbearance they're receiving in total from industry-wide participants, so that will be an effect.
So as you think about the reserve provisioning in the quarter, the vast majority is the deterioration of the
macroeconomic assumptions that we put into our model. There's some qualitative that we put out for forbearance
but it's not a large part of the reserve build.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Just a question on the RSA as we're thinking about the back half of the year. I think in the past, you had given
some expectations for how we should be thinking about the RSA in the second half versus the first half. And I'm
wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see the driver is there as we go into 2H.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Sure, Betsy. So obviously, we haven't provided any specific guidance mainly because some of the unknown is
really related to credit. But as I think about a framework how you should think about the RSA back half of this year
and really into 2021, the first is the program performance, so how the loan receivables really develop here and
16


Synchrony Financial
(SYF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
more importantly how the net interest margin kind of comes back and how it develops as you begin to see
delinquency developing. Obviously, our partners share in that revenue side of the equation. Obviously, credit
costs will factor in more likely in 2021, so you'll see probably an increased benefit continue in the back half of the
year from a net credit write-off perspective through the RSA.
As you think about the reserve provisioning which is probably the larger wild card here, unfortunately what you
see is, first of all, a platform mix issue, right? So so far, we have booked probably more of the CECL benefit really
sitting in CareCredit and Payment Solutions given they attract a higher CECL reserve provisioning given the
length and nature of those assets. Inside the Retail Card portfolio, it's ultimately going to come down to the mix of
partners that flow in there. As we know, you have some partners that share in the reserve, some partners that
don't share in the reserve. And unfortunately, as we sit here today we're just making estimates with regard to how
the delinquency formation works and how that will go into the loss content as we build into 2021. So they are
some variable pieces here. So I think there is a little bit of timing where the impact of the RSA may be delayed,
but we really have to see where those two move from a reserve perspective. But again, we hope to be moving
forward on a NIM perspective and charge-offs could put a little upward pressure on the RSA from just the
performance before you think about reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, Margaret, you did a really interesting podcast at the end of May with ICE, and there's a lot
of detail as to how you're thinking on that. And I was just wondering at one point, the question was how does the
pandemic impact Synchrony. And as a part of the answer, you were talking about being a smaller company. But I
wonder if either there was more detail there around that that you could explain or if your view has changed given
that maybe between now and the end of May things aren't as tough?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. I think I was really referring to the fact that we definitely have seen our assets shrink a bit. And as a result
of that, it's what Brian talked about; we're going to have to do a reset of expenses and align ourselves so that we
keep the return of the business in the area that we like. I think it's – like any difficult situation, I think people rise to
the occasion and we're able to really just step back and say, okay, coming out of this, how do we want to make
sure we're set up for the future? And I think the fact that we've been around for 90 years, have been through a lot,
we're positioned that way. But I think particularly as we move more digital, we're going to have to make sure our
resources are aligned to align with that digital transformation that we continue to make. And so I think we're really
looking at all the levers inside our business to ensure things don't get away from us and that we're really coming
out of this in a way that we have the right partners, the right program, the right digital experience and capabilities,
building out our data like we've been continuing to do, and then ensuring that the returns in our business continue
to deliver for our shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. And Betsy, the thing I'd add, and just not to get lost in this, when you think about the sequential decline in
average loan receivables, it's down over almost $5.7 billion. So clearly, we're trying to make sure that we
understand where the depth of that could be and that we react. And I think when you think about the efficiency
ratio in the quarter, when you strip out some of the operational losses in COVID-19 response, we're at a I think
33.6% efficiency ratio. So we want to get that back in line with where we can continue to deliver a higher ROA
17

business. So that's really what I think is driving it, and hopefully here we'll have to see how the sales play out as
we move through the back half of the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. So Margaret, I guess is it fair to say you continue to sort of see credit coming in better than
expected? It surprised me how resilient the consumer has been. And I know we can't infer too much from your
reserve, but if NCOs are peaking in the first half of 2021, it would suggest an NCO loss rate that is not
significantly higher than where you are and certainly a lot lower than the credit crisis. Do you think stimulus is
what's really doing it and what are your thoughts in the near-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I think – look. I think one thing we all know is the consumer going into this was pretty strong, right? So –
and I think what we're seeing, and we're even seeing this in deposits, right? Consumers have more cash, they're
hoarding more cash and they're paying their bills. Now I think the big caveat in all of this, Don, is really what
happens when the stimulus ends which is going to happen soon if they don't come up with a new plan? What is
that new stimulus? And then how quickly do people get back to work? And I think that's the factor where I have to
say – I've been around the business for 40 years – I don't think any of us would've expected to see what is
happening happening in terms of delinquencies. I think we're kind of a bit surprised and thought there would
definitely be more pressure there.
So I think we have to really see the third and fourth quarter to really understand what's the next phase of stimulus,
how does that play out. And I do think we're anticipating more job loss. I think what we've seen so far is the things
that are connected to travel, entertainment, restaurants, things like that. But I think every company is stepping
back and looking at their own cost structures and how does that play into it. So I think we're trying to be cautious
about this because if you just took how we're doing to-date, we should be patting ourselves on the back and
saying oh, things look great, but I think the reality is there's more to come and we just have to be ready for that.
And that's really what we're trying to ensure we are doing both from an underwriting perspective, ensuring we're
reserving properly, and then the third area of really taking a hard look at expenses to make sure we're positioned
right as we come out of this.

Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The only thing I'd add, Don, the book is fundamentally different than it was a year ago, most certainly if you
work backwards in time. With Walmart kind of coming out, when you think about the portfolio, the fact today that
we'll only have 24% of the book below 660, down 300 basis points from the first quarter, clearly the effects of
stimulus and forbearance, industry-wide forbearance has driven our payment rate. Our payment rate was $15.60
for the quarter, up 83 basis points year-over-year, so people are paying down their debt.
The good news is because we've migrated credit, we are seeing better performance. And ultimately, Margaret hit
on the point, is as unemployment does develop, so when you get back to what our estimate will be towards the
end of the year, is there a fundamental rotation in there that will give you a different outcome? We're anticipating
that. I think we are executing our credit enhancements around that. But again, we'll have to see how that
develops. But I think it goes to a testament to how we've modified the book from the GFC and then really the tools
and data elements that we're using to manage the book today to hopefully drive credit in a fundamentally positive
way as we move into this recession.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, I want to follow-up on a theme that I think we've
explored a little bit here. But when we look at the reserve increase versus the change in economic outlook, it
almost feels like the correlation is a little bit lower than it's been historically. And again, I think you guys have
touched upon some of the factors there, forbearance policy initiatives which have dampened that relationship. I'm
curious if you think that ultimately the risk is the duration of the cycle that could drive that correlation back to the
historical norm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Rick. As you think about it, I think the historical norm does have Walmart and it does have some
other things. You have to almost adjust at the start of it the strength of the consumer and the change in the
underlying portfolio as you look forward. So most certainly, we're very sensitive to the duration of the impact or if
it's more prolonged than we think then most certainly it would be. But when we look at our stress results, even if
you go back to what we published back in 2018, they are better ex-Walmart. So I do think that's in. And I think
when you think about this quarter, the fact that we've had such a large decrease in our receivables, there's a
pretty big volume offset, so the rate part of the provision is up significantly in the quarter. So – but again, it's going
to be – you hit on it. It's going to be really how that curve develops out and whether or not there's a fundamental
mix shift inside the unemployment we're thinking.

Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Wanted to quickly just follow-up on the reserve build
discussion. You've talked on this call about the potential for the unemployment pool to change a bit where you
have maybe some higher income consumers lose jobs going forward. And I just wanted to clarify does the
reserve build already account for this change or is this something that you're keeping an eye on, that you're
worried that could happen and you will then need to build reserves for it? I understand the magnitude might be
different, but just trying to understand what is already reserved for versus what won't be.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. It's a great question and I think we've tried to model some of that. But ultimately, because we're seeing a
strengthening of credit as we move forward and really a strengthening of credit even inside of the credit grade, it's
difficult to ultimately predict that. So we've put some level of investment in; it's just subject to a lot of uncertainty.
Now there's a lot of, as we all read, the indications that there are going to be a large number of layoffs in some of
these higher income jobs. But until we actually see that and what builds in our portfolio, it is somewhat difficult.
But we've put some estimate in for how we think the portfolio performs as we move forward but that is just a risk
factor, ultimately how it develops.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. Thanks. Just one other last question. Just could you maybe just discuss some of the newer
programs you've launched? And here, I'm thinking of the Synchrony HOME program, the Car Care or maybe
even the GP card. How have they performed through the crisis and to the extent you're willing to share just in
terms of the volume of credit trends and how that compares to the rest of the portfolio or even your expectations?
Does that change your appetite for wanting to grow those? Just trying to understand how you're thinking about...

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...those programs now that you've had a crisis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Margaret M. Keane A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. No, I think I'd say all of them are performing well. They perform no differently than the overall book. I would
say particularly, we're seeing a lot of strength in HOME. I'm sure many of you have seen that homes seems to be
where people are spending their money, and so we're definitely seeing good take-up in people buying furniture,
home improvement and the like. So both our HOME card and our partners that deal in the home are definitely
seeing a lot of strength. Car Care is a little different in that the actual Car card is fine, but when – gas has been
down but that's starting to pick up as people start driving more, but it's still not to the level of where people were
driving pre-pandemic. But I'd say overall, from a credit perspective and origination perspective and utilization
perspective, we feel really good about all of those programs and we'll continue to look to grow them.
