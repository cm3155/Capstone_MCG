President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. With this being my first earnings call as CEO, I'd like to say what
an honor it is to follow a great leader like Greg Carmichael.
Let's jump right in. Earlier today, we reported a solid second quarter, reflecting our focus on profitability, organic
growth, and through-the-cycle returns. We generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense
discipline, producing adjusted PPNR growth of 11% compared to last year. We extended our track record for
strong organic growth, adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer; and
both our recent acquisitions, Dividend Finance and Provide, achieved [audio gap] originations.
Charge-offs remained low; NPAs and early-stage delinquencies improved sequentially; and we saw no decline in
the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic. With that said, there is no question
in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year. Due to the potential
forward economic challenges, we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit, as reflected in our reserve
coverage.
Turning to the balance sheet. Loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise. Average commercial
loan growth was driven by C&I, which included a 1% increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit. We
3

generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals; and our Chicago, Cincinnati, North and
South Carolina, and Florida regions led the way in middle market lending.
Average consumer loans grew in almost all categories. Our results include a small benefit from our mid-May
closing of Dividend Finance. We're very excited about Dividend as rising energy costs and the trend of
homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity.
Switching to deposits, our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary, with average balances
intentionally down $6 billion sequentially and stable from the prior year as we focused on margins over volume
given our overall liquidity position. We have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation of consumer
deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the LCR rule.
Consumer transaction deposits grew 1% sequentially and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by
continued growth in Momentum Banking and double-digit deposit balance growth in our Southeast markets.
Commercial transaction deposits were down sequentially, partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess
balances to higher-yielding alternatives, combined with some seasonal impacts. As of yesterday, total deposit
balances have remained stable since mid-May, despite the Fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second
quarter.
As a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline, net interest income increased 12% sequentially or
15% excluding the impact of PPP, Ginnie Mae, and the securities prepayment penalty income. As we indicated in
the investor conference last month, fees were softer for the quarter, reflecting the impact of market conditions on
debt capital markets, mortgage, and wealth management. I am, however, quite pleased with the strength and
diversification of our underlying fee growth engines.
In payments, our gross treasury management revenue increased 7% and credit card spend grew 10%, both
compared to a year ago quarter. In capital markets, financial risk management revenue increased 18% and M&A
advisory revenue grew 30%, the majority of which was sourced from existing middle-market relationships. In
wealth management, despite the market volatility, personal asset management revenue was up 3% year-to-date,
and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net AUM flows.
We continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the Bank, reflecting our multi-year continuous
improvement discipline, which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech modernization
strategies. Looking forward, our proactive actions over the past several years with respect to our minimum wage
and other employee retention strategies should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers.
With respect to capital, we recently announced our 2.5% stress capital buffer requirement from the Fed's stress
test exercise, the minimum under the regulatory capital rules. Our top priorities for capital deployment remain
funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend.
We recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to $0.03 in September, subject to
board approval and economic conditions. Given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the Bank slightly
above our capital targets in the current environment, we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the
remainder of the year at this time.
While credit quality remains benign, we remain cautious of the impact of the Fed's continued aggressive monetary
policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy. Over the past several years, we have built Fifth
Third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment. We have been consistent on
4

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion, product
innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning noncore businesses.
We have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality
commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintain the lowest
overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers, and 93%
of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate.
We have protected NII through a series of actions, including our securities portfolio positioning, adding cash flow
hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade, and by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with
a focus on primary relationships. Through the Dividend and Provide acquisitions, we added fixed rate loan
origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment.
Our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers. Under my
leadership, you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long term in mind, to hold ourselves
accountable to what we say we are going to do, and to invest in product and service innovations that generate
sustainable long-term value for customers and shareholders alike.
In closing, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to say thank you to our employees who are listening
today. As you know, banks inhabit a special place in the communities where they operate, and with that comes a
special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change.
You work hard every day to live our purpose, including delivering 8 million meals to fight hunger across our
footprint as part of Fifth Third Day, as well as positioning us to achieve our new $100 billion environmental and
social finance commitment. I also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve
our customers' lives.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our
current outlook.

James C. Leonard
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid. We generated
strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at
attractive entry points, and remained disciplined in managing our deposit costs.
Expenses were once again well-controlled even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Fees did
underperform our April expectations due to the market volatility but even with that softness, we generated core
PPNR growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis.
As a result, we achieved a sub-55% efficiency ratio and generated 7 points of positive operating leverage from the
second quarter of 2021. The ACL ratio increased 5 basis points sequentially to 1.85%, which includes a 4-basis-
point impact from the Dividend Finance acquisition. Combined with $62 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a
$179 million total provision for credit losses.
Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.3 billion increased 12% sequentially
and 11% year-over-year. As Tim mentioned, the underlying NII growth was around 15% compared to last quarter,
5

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates and half from the combination of
investment portfolio growth and loan growth, primarily in C&I.
Our interest-bearing core deposit costs were well-controlled at just 9 basis points this quarter, up just 5 basis
points sequentially, and helped drive the 33 basis points of NIM expansion during the quarter. Total reported
noninterest income decreased 1% sequentially and increased 3% on an adjusted basis.
Compared to the prior quarter, we generated improved financial risk management, card and processing, gross
treasury management fees, and private equity income, which was partially offset by weaker performance from our
market-sensitive businesses, including commercial capital markets and mortgage and the impact of higher
treasury management earnings credit rates.
Noninterest expense decreased 9% compared to the prior quarter, driven by a decline in compensation and
benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter, lower incentive-based comp in the current quarter
due to market dynamics that impacted fees, and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company.
Expenses in the quarter included a $27 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of nonqualified
deferred compensation, which has a corresponding offset in security losses. This compares to a $12 million
benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the nonqualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods, total
noninterest expense decreased $95 million or 8%. Noninterest expense decreased 4% compared to the year-ago
quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Including held-
for-sale loans, total average loans increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio
loans and leases increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans.
Commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise, outperforming our original expectations.
Our production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments in talent as we continued to see strength
in new quality relationship generation during the second quarter. With muted payoffs and a 1% increase in the
revolver utilization rate to 37%, period-end commercial loans increased 3% sequentially and 12% compared to
the year-ago quarter.
Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 3% compared to the prior quarter, driven by
residential mortgage and the Dividend acquisition, which are recorded in other consumer loans. This growth was
partially offset by a decline in home equity. At quarter end, total dividend loan balances were $650 million,
reflecting our decision to hold some loans the dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their post-close
production volume.
Average core deposits were stable compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased 4% compared to the prior
quarter, including the impact of the intentional run-off of excess and higher cost commercial deposits. This run-off
was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 8% and average
consumer transaction deposits increased 1%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households.
Given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters, we deployed cash into the securities
portfolio, which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately $12 billion. We
completed net purchases of $6 billion in securities during the second quarter, compared to $13 billion in the prior
quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
The higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating
planned second half of 2022 purchases, given the attractive entry points in late May and June. We currently
expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year.
We have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and
predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increased from
64% to 67% at quarter end, and our duration increased from 5.4 to 5.7 years.
Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations. The NPA
ratio of 47 basis points, improved 2 basis points sequentially, with net charge-offs of just 21 basis points. The ratio
of early-stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due relative to loans, was stable in the second quarter; and the
amount of loans 90 days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago.
We continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed, such as central business district
hotels, senior living and office CRE. We are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may
cause stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns, as well as the ongoing
monitoring of the leveraged loan portfolio.
Our ACL build this quarter was $117 million, of which approximately 75% was from strong loan growth, including
the $53 million ACL impact from the Dividend acquisition; and the remaining 25% was attributable to worsening
economic projections relative to March, net of reductions in certain pandemic-related qualitative adjustments.
Given the incremental clarity on the economy's ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout
with vaccine efficacy and other measures, we elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of
80% to the baseline and 10% to the downside and upside scenarios. We believe our models are better suited to
appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on
humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars.
Despite the scenario weight change, we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as CRE, where we
continue to believe there are elevated risks. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively
stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%, which is
slightly weaker than our previous estimate. Additionally, GDP growth and home price forecasts have weakened
relative to our March forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios.
Our expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further
strain supply chains, including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints
becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the
economic environment.
Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9% compared to 9.3% in the prior quarter. The decline in
capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth, reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact
of the Dividend Finance acquisition. We expect to accrete capital to the 9.25% area by year end given our strong
earnings capacity, and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time.
Moving to our current outlook. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect average total loan growth between
5% and 6% compared to 2021 or around 10%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae impacts, reflecting strong pipelines
and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Dividend Finance is generating strong origination volumes. We expect loan originations of around $1.3 billion in
the second half of 2022, which is 30% more than our original estimates. Similarly, Provide loan production
remains strong as we expect over $1 billion in total production in 2022. Dividend and Provide together are
expected to contribute a little more than 1% of the total average loan growth for the year.
We expect average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 14% to 15%, excluding PPP. We expect total
average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our
returns on capital. We expect around $7 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still
result in double-digit growth in average indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes
growth of approximately 15% in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of Dividend Finance.
Shifting to the income statement. We continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which will
be a record year of revenue for Fifth Third. Given our outlook for earning asset growth, combined with the implied
forward curve as of July 1, which assumes a Fed funds rate of 3.25% by year-end, we expect full year NII to
increase 17% to 18%. Our outlook incorporates the impacts from run-off of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios.
Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would be around 20%.
Our current outlook assumes average deposit balances decline a couple billion dollars in the third quarter,
reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter run-off of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and
seasonality, and then return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Since the onset of the rate hikes, our deposit betas have been muted at low-single digits for the cycle to date. We
expect increases to our interest-bearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next two quarters due to the
timing, impact of deposit repricing lags from earlier hikes, and continued aggressive rate hikes from the Fed.
We continue to expect a 25% deposit beta on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of
around 45% to 50% on the next 75 basis points of rate hikes. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes
will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management
strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas.
We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down 7% to 8% in 2022, reflecting softer second quarter
performance, combined with the high probability of continued market volatility, reflecting a more aggressive rate
outlook, including lower wealth and asset management, mortgage and capital markets revenue, as well as higher
earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth.
Despite the expected decline in capital markets revenue, we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up
nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic 2019 levels, which highlights the success we've had over the past few years in
growing a diversified capital markets business. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense, including the
impacts of Dividend Finance, to be stable to down 1% compared to 2021, an improvement from our previous
guide of up 1% to 2%.
We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both
technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we add 20 to 25 new branches, primarily in our
high-growth Southeast markets in 2022. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per
hour that went into effect on July 4.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
We expect these investments in our people, platforms, and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process
automation initiatives; reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio; a decline in leasing
expense, given our LaSalle Solutions sale; and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company.
As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth, combined with our expense outlook, should generate
4 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around 8%. Full year adjusted
PPNR growth is expected to be 17% to 19%, which is an improvement to the range compared to our April
estimate, reflecting the strong NII and expense outcomes, partially offset by the market-related fee headwinds.
Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our
ability to grow our customer base, combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline.
For the third quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to increase 1% sequentially, reflecting 1% to
2% growth in commercial and stable consumer balances. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase
$2 billion to $3 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter.
Shifting to the income statement. We expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of 8% to 9% compared with
the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 11% to 12% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of
securities purchases, and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning.
We expect adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect total
adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to the second quarter or up 2% compared to the
year-ago quarter due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend Finance.
Excluding the second quarter NQDC benefits on expenses, we expect noninterest expenses to increase around
2% sequentially. We continue to expect third quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20- to 25-
basis-point range.
In summary, with our balance sheet positioning, PPNR growth engine, and disciplined credit risk management,
we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Morning, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two questions, one on the buyback. I just wanted to understand the thought process around when the
reinstatement would be. Is that a function of a certain CET1 that you're looking to achieve and should we take it to
mean that you'll restart it in 1Q? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, Betsy, it's Jamie. With – given the environment that we're operating in, we, as you can tell from our results,
are clearly positioning to be a little more cautious in this environment. So, we think accreting capital for the
remainder of the year would be appropriate, and then we'll evaluate resuming the buybacks in the first quarter of
2023. And certainly, that would be outlook-dependent, but that's the current plan as we sit here today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, on the deposit side, I know you mentioned that deposits have been stable since the middle of
May. And it's interesting that you didn't see that deposit outflow continue in June. I'm just wondering, is there a
certain kind of depositor that you think will be – that the outflow came from a type of depositor that will not be
incented when the Fed raises rates next week. And the corollary here is, if you have deposits stable but loan
growth continues to be robust as you're indicating, how are you thinking about funding that? What type of
borrowings are you looking to access? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Great question, and I'll start and turn it over to Bryan for some additional color. Actually, I think it was at
your conference in early June that we talked about our plans on managing the balance sheet from a deposit
standpoint. And frankly, for the past year, year-and-a-half, we said we'd like to see about $10 billion of the
deposits run off.
Fortunately, this quarter, we were able to really manage the balance sheet almost exactly as we had intended.
Again, at your conference, I think, we said we'd end the quarter at a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74%, and we finished
10


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
at 74.7%. So, I do feel good about how we positioned the balance sheet and our ability to rightsize it. And maybe
with that, turn it over to Bryan to give a little more color on what we've seen on the outflows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, absolutely. We made the deliberate decision to not match market rates on certain high beta, lower
relationship depth customers. As we've said all along, we estimated about $10 billion in excess balances in our
commercial deposit book that we believed may not be sticky. We do not have a lot of appetite for 100% beta
balances that want to be priced at Fed funds or Fed funds plus.
We were in a position to let about $5 billion of these balances find a new home. We've not lost customer
relationships. We know what it would take from a pricing perspective to get these balances back. A decent
amount of these funds ended up in our liquidity portal, which gives our customers access to money market
investments.
We also saw some heightened seasonality this year, Betsy, as it relates to tax payments that were a little bit
larger. And we estimate the tax payment impact was another $4 billion to $5 billion of the run-off. Our commercial
balances, as we said, were stable since mid-May. Our consumer balances continue to be very stable and sticky.
And overall, we're pleased with our cost of total interest-bearing core deposits of 9 bps, up only 5 bps from the
first quarter.
In terms of how we're thinking about funding balance sheet growth from here, we're always going to be focused
on being core deposit funded. We have a lot of levers that we can continue to pull to grow deposits from here, and
we're confident in our ability to do that. That being said, we will use short-term borrowings as a mechanism to help
us manage volatility in the balance sheet month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter; and that includes funding
opportunistic investment portfolio purchases that we've done.
Additionally, over time, we've obviously run down our long-term debt portfolio. We'll be looking to re-enter the
banknote market. We do think it's important for us to get some structure back into our liability framework. And so,
that's something that we'll use as well. But we continue to be confident with our ability to be core deposit funded.
We're still sitting here at a 75% loan-to-deposit ratio. And so, we feel very good right now about our overall
positioning.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on deposits. So, it sounds
like exclusive of the run-off or, pardon me, the continued impact of the decisions you made in the second quarter,
we'd see sort of stable deposits or growth otherwise. Jamie, what are you thinking in terms of what will grow, are
those consumer or commercial deposits, as we look during the year?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, I – talking on the consumer side first, obviously, we have a great retail franchise with tremendous products
with momentum and the de novo plan and the Southeast buildout. So, retail deposits we would expect to continue
to grow in the back half of the year. On the commercial side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll probably see
a little bit more run-off, a couple billion in the third quarter before we experience a return to growth in the fourth
quarter.
And again, that'll be driven by our treasury management business, where I think we've presented at different
conferences talking about how our TM business is best-in-class in the regional bank space in terms of TM fees as
a percent of revenue or TM fees as a – to loan commitments to help show that share of wallet. And I think Bryan's
comments are very important to realize that these weren't lost relationships, this was just excess money going to
a better home, and we expected it. And from here, it'll just be business as usual.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think if I could add one thing there that maybe has been less fully appreciated. I think, to Jamie's point, we've
talked a lot about Momentum Banking. We've talked about treasury management. But among our investor peers,
we also have the highest percentage of our branch network that has been open less than five years. And the
majority of that time has not been in that environment where we were focused on deposit gathering out of those
locations, so much as we were household growth and otherwise.
And the byproduct of that is we think there's a lot of latent new deposit generation power that will come out of the,
call it, 70 de novos that have been opened in the Southeast and 20 in addition that are going to come between
the second half of this year and the first quarter of next year, that will provide an additional kick in terms of core
deposit generation above and beyond what we're getting out of Momentum Banking and the treasury
management business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, if I could ask separate one. Just maybe, Jamie, your thoughts on sort of
drivers of the continued weakness in fees in the third quarter? I think some of them are probably I think logically
what they would be, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of puts and takes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think in this environment, the accelerated rate hikes and magnitude of the rate hikes just continue to
weigh on the rate-dependent fee businesses. So, the outlook for mortgage, capital markets, and TM earnings
credits are the biggest drivers of the change in our fee outlook.
As Tim mentioned in the prepared remarks, the fee equivalent growth has actually been very strong. It's just, as
we get that additional NII benefit from the rate hikes, we give a portion of it back in the rates paid on earnings
credit. So, from here, I would expect the strong consumer household growth to help carry the day on a
combination of card and deposit service charges. But as a reminder, we are implementing or did implement July
1, the elimination of the NSF fee. So, that will weigh a little bit on the back half of the year fee guide.

And then, on wealth and asset management fees, we've done a great job of new customer acquisition, as well as
our AUM net inflows but, obviously, the market headwinds have an impact on the fee revenue there. So that,
again, is in the updated guide. And then, commercial banking is really a fascinating tale of two cities where our
ability to help customers manage different exposures that they want to hedge, whether it's rates, commodities or
FX, along with our institutional brokerage business, is just growing 30-plus percent, but the disruption in the
capital markets having a big impact on the corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees.
And we don't really, in our outlook, expect significant improvement in the capital markets activity in the back half
of the year. And I guess, when you add up our fee outlook in total, we made about $1.4 billion in the first half of
the year. We're saying we'll make $1.5 billion, plus or minus a little bit, in the back half of the year. And the TRA –
of that $100 million of growth, the TRA is half of it. So, at least for now, that's how we see the back half of the year
playing out.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Okay. Thank you. Jamie, you pointed out some very strong loan growth numbers for the commercial and
industrial portfolio. Can you guys share with share with us where you're seeing this growth, both geographically
and by industry. And then, as – and in addition to that, I assume you're probably going to expect to see utilization
rates go up as well as that growth comes in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, I'll take the second part of the question first. When it comes to the line utilization, and I'm glad you asked
the question. What we saw in the second quarter was that, in total, line utilization moved up 1 point, and we're
guiding for the rest of the year for that to actually be stable. So, we'll see how things play out. And in the second
quarter, the movement in the line utilization – the biggest group that moved was actually the middle market group,
was up several points. And so, that was nice to see.
From a production standpoint, it was pretty widespread. And again, a very strong quarter of middle market
production. I think Tim mentioned several geographies in his prepared remarks, but Cincinnati, Carolinas, Florida.
It's a consistent story for us, where a little bit of softness in East Michigan, Northern Ohio is more than offset by
strong performance in the rest of the Midwest and the Southeast.
And then, from a vertical perspective, the renewables team continue – and energy continues to go very robust, as
well as our TMT business. So, we feel good about, frankly, the ability to acquire new customers in this
environment, the sales teams with the RM expansion play out West, as well as in the Southeast has worked very
well. We're just mindful of what appears to us to be a slowing economy and, therefore, we're trimming a little bit
on the edges. But frankly, the core is performing very well, and you see that in the results this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, as a follow-up question and pivoting to credit quality for a moment. Obviously, you guys
have very strong credit quality and you built up the reserves, as you pointed out, in this quarter. And I understand
that with the numbers being so small with you and your peers, one or two loans can move the numbers. So, with
that as a backdrop, can you give us some color on two questions on the commercial portfolio.
First is, the transfer to nonaccrual status, that was an increase of about $100 million this quarter versus $47
million in the prior quarter. Just any color there? And second, I believe you had a higher charge-off number in that
category as well at $45 million versus $1 million in the prior quarter. And again, I emphasize the numbers – one
loan can move those numbers since they're so low, but I'm just curious.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Gerard, it's Richard. Thanks for the question. You've described it in your question, what's happening.
We're at levels that are so low, there's a little bit of balancing along the bottom porpoising, if you will, the change
in both NPA and charge-offs was a handful – with a handful of loans that it just finally rolled to a place where we
needed to take a more direct action in terms of making them nonaccrual and charging them off. I think, overall,
the portfolio continues to perform, as you point out, very well, well inside our appetite, and we're very pleased
about where we sit today, both today and then also with the outlook in front of us.

As a follow-up to Gerard's question on the – on credit, the increase that you just talked about in the nonaccruals
and charge-offs in the commercial side. So, there's a handful of loans. Any commonality in terms of industries or
businesses that would help give us a little bit of color there? And then, separately, are you seeing any signs of
emerging stress anywhere within your portfolio worth noting? I know you're keeping an eye on commercial real
estate and your leverage portfolio as well. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Stein A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, no commonality by industry in those names. I think, certainly, the economic headwinds of inflation, labor,
supply chain were elements to the – those were the common elements, but different industries, different
segments. But they ultimately put pressure on cash flow, and that caused us to able to take different action.
Broadly, in terms of pressure, I mean, it's the same thing we've talked about. We've talked about office, that
continues to be challenged. Senior living, again, that's another place where you see a disconnect between cost
inflation and what they can get from a reimbursement rate perspective.
And then, what we're watching are places where changes in consumer behavior are shifting, whether it's from
durables and discretionary to consumables and nondiscretionary. But no large segments. There's a little bit of
idiosyncratic movement across the portfolio, but nothing major that causes us any concern.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Great. And then – and my follow-up is somewhat related on credit to a degree. The – your
rationale of pullback in auto, I know you've been talking about that. Can you just give us a kind of a reminder of
the reason of pullback, what you're seeing? Is it more just about the competition in the space or are you seeing
something on the credit front that is driving that decision? Because we did see – we are having some other banks
talk about that pullback as well? And then, separately, don't know if you have your criticized asset trend or change
that you can give us color on for the quarter? Thanks.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Yeah. Sure, John. Thanks for the question. In terms of auto, when we started the year, our forecast was about
$11 billion in total production for a combination of auto plus the specialty business, RV and marine. We're now
expecting to do about $7 billion in total in that asset class. And so, the $4 billion of reduction is solely driven by
the returns dynamic in that sector where several large players have certainly – if it's not irrational, it's certainly
very aggressive pricing and, therefore, we don't want to compete on an indirect asset class at such low spreads.
So, spreads have dropped to levels that were reminiscent of when we did the pullback five or six years ago. So,
the good news for us is we keep the dealer relationships. We're continuing to monitor performance. We have
spreads back up towards our target level and feel good about the production from a credit quality perspective, as
well as the spreads, but it's just not an asset class you want to grow with single-digit returns on capital. In terms of
the credits, they were fairly stable in the quarter, not a lot to report there.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Oh, hey, guys. Good morning. Just following up on the deposit side. So, hearing your earlier comments about the
purposeful outflows, just wondering if you can give us a sense of like are we at the right bottoming spot on the
nonoperational side?
And given the good start to deposit betas, where your interest-bearing costs were only up 5 basis points, can you
just give us updated thoughts on how you're expecting betas to trend from here relative to...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...your previous expectations? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think from an end-of-period perspective, we've accomplished what we wanted to accomplish on the
nonoperational excess deposits. So, again, there'll be an average effect in the third quarter. But overall, we said,
year and a half ago, we'd like to get $10 billion of the excess out. I think we've done that.
And frankly, year-over-year deposits are flat. So, it's not – shouldn't be a big surprise to people that we were able
to rightsize it. And again, the loan-to-deposit ratio at 74.7%, would love to get it into the mid-80s over a period of
several years, but that would certainly be driven more by continued loan growth, as opposed to any more deposit
run-off.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
In terms of the betas, it is difficult, I think, to track betas by quarter when the Fed is moving in such big chunks.
But how we see it playing out is that we'd have a fourth quarter beta of 23%. The month of December would be
28%. And then, by the time we get to mid-year next year, the trail effect – because in our forecast, we have the
Fed going to 3.25% and then stopping for a little bit longer than normal period of time. And therefore, there'll be a
little bit of that drift effect as the lag catches up so that the ultimate beta ends up being 30% on the 300 basis
points of rate hikes.
So, from a rates paid perspective, it looks something in the area of the 9 basis points this quarter, it goes to mid-
40s in the third, mid-70s in the fourth, and then drifts to the mid-90s by the second quarter of 2023. That's how we
think this will play out, and then we'll continue to see deposit growth beginning in the fourth quarter and thereafter.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I really like your slide 4. So, your NIM's up 33 basis points linked quarter; and 19 basis points is due to rates, I
get that; 16 basis points is due to securities. It looks like your timing was good in late May and June. But only 1
basis point due to loan growth. So, I guess, I think about the remixing of the portfolio into higher-yielding
securities, yes, but even higher yielding loans, which doesn't show up.
So, I guess, on the one hand, your deposits are down 7% period-end. So, what was the margin on those
deposits? Like you were – I guess, you've been saying that's really low-margin stuff. You're not staying around for
100% deposit beta deposits. So, I get that. That's probably helping you running that off. On the other hand, why
don't you have more pickup from loan growth? Are you just originating low-yielding loans or what?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan Preston A
Treasurer, Fifth Third Bancorp
No, I wouldn't say we're originating low-yielding loans. The mix of a lot of our loan growth in our C&I book, just
given the floating rate nature of that portfolio and where it's been pricing in, has been relatively neutral in terms of
the NIM impact, but it does drive a decent amount of NII. Some of the consumer assets that we've been talking
about, especially the dividend assets, in particular, it's just a late quarter impact. So, you'll start to see some
pickup from those in the future as those balances have a bigger average balance impact.
But overall, we do expect to see some pickup. The – we will continue to see NII benefits just because of the asset
sensitivity of our commercial floating rate portfolio, and we'll see some nice kind of drive from here. And our NIM
will continue to increase throughout the year. We would expect to end the year in a kind of a 3.30% to 3.35%-ish
range from a NIM perspective in the fourth quarter. So, a lot of earnings power is still to come.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, in terms of your expense control, Tim, this is your – I guess, as you said, your first earnings call as
CEO, so you probably want to get the guidance right. And you guys are guiding third quarter for 8% higher
revenues and only 2% higher core expenses. Actually, if you look at first quarter to third quarter, your run rate NII
should be going up by one-fourth based on your guidance, even while your expenses and your guide is to be
lower. So, I guess how confident are you in that? And what is your incremental profit margin and why would it be
so much better than your existing profit margin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
All right. Yeah, Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, to answer, narrowly very in terms of our level of confidence
on our ability to manage expenses. I think the driver here when you think about our business, right, the people
costs are a huge share of our overall expense base. And we've been, I think, very public about the efforts that we
have made over the course of the past few years to drive not only a culture of continuous expense discipline, but
also a real focus on leveraging the technology investments we have been making to drive automation and reduce
the unit costs associated with core processing activities.
So, our FTE count on a – is down about 600 right now, which is a big driver of the savings in terms of expense
management, and that's helping us. So, it's less a dynamic around the margin on the incremental business, so
much as it is us continuing to make progress on the fixed cost base and the variable costs associated with our
existing business activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And Mike, I would say, yes, your math on the NII is very good, and we are highly confident in that. I would say, if
there are two things Fifth Third is extremely good at, one is balance sheet management, and you see that in the
NIM expansion; and as Bryan mentioned, the continued expansion over the course of the year.
And then, we're also very efficient from an expense standpoint. And what you have happening is that, as there is
fee weakness – back to your profit margin question, as there is fee weakness, fees have a higher cost of delivery
than obviously NII. NII for the most part's dropping straight to the bottom line. And so, that's certainly an element
of helping the efficiency ratio.
But in addition to that, all of the expense savings initiatives we have going on in the company, as Tim mentioned,
year-over-year, we're down 600 people if you exclude the acquisitions and dispositions. And just sequentially,
we're down 260 people, exclusive of the acquisitions and the dispositions. And that's rightsizing our mortgage
business, closing one of our fulfillment sites, rightsizing the indirect auto and specialty business given the
slowdown in volumes, and then all of the LPA enhancements with reducing IT and ops and the branch closure
benefits from the first quarter.
So, we have a lot going on underneath to help provide those tailwinds on expenses, but then we're very mindful of
continuing to invest. And so, in the third quarter, in the guide, you have an increase in technology and marketing,
and then a little bit of noise from the NQDC, assuming it comes out at 0 in the third quarter, which is the driver
why expenses will be up 4% to 5% sequentially. But overall, feel very good about our ability to deliver an efficient
balance sheet and an efficient income statement.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Just two follow-up questions for me, please. Jamie, how should we think about how you're thinking of the
securities portfolio from here? Do you feel like that's something that you will continue to build, especially after
deposit growth comes back? Or do you think it could be a source of funding as deposit pricing accelerates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, I would expect the investment portfolio to be stable from here. I would not expect to be selling down the
portfolio to fund loan growth. It, obviously, in a crisis could be a great source of liquidity but that would probably be
through more collateral usage at FHLB or backing – backstopping public funds deposits.
But overall, I'd expect it to be stable. And the yield – our guide for the back half of the year on yield is in the 2.80%
[range] both for the third quarter as well as on a full year basis. So, that yield guide is up a bit. as Mike pointed
out, with some fortuitous timing on the additional leverage we've added.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And maybe this is for Richard. I'll give you the CECL question near the end of the hour. What – could you
remind us, when you built your ACL to 2.41% in 2020, what was the unemployment rate that you were assuming?
And the reason I ask this is, at 1.85% ACL, if we think about the scenario – different scenarios of charge-off in a
mild recession for Fifth Third, taking into account the deal thing that's been going on, it feels like in a mild
downturn your ACL is in the right place.
And any guidance on this would be great because, obviously, everybody's now anticipating some sort of
downturns sooner rather than later?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Erika, it's Jamie. I'll take that one, and I'll answer your question a little bit differently than how you asked it,
because the only piece of data I have on the history is the unemployment level versus day one.
So, our current scenario for the baseline has unemployment at 3.4%, 3.5%, 3.7% versus the day one reserve in
years one, two, and three were 3.6%, 4.3% and 4.4%. So, versus day one, unemployment is a little better, but the
big driver of our variance to day one reserves is that the GDP outlook and collateral values, both for housing and
19


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
auto, are worse. And then, obviously, the rate environment is significantly worse which, in the modelling, puts
pressure on corporate profits.
So, we're sitting a little bit elevated over the day one levels. But to your point, we think that is a prudent place to
be. And frankly, versus the last quarter, the scenarios are certainly worse. And so, GDP erosion, housing pricing
is worse, interest rates higher.
So, from our standpoint, when you have a period of strong loan growth, like we did in the second quarter, you
have eroding economic forecasts, you should have a CECL build. And then, on top of that, we have the Dividend
acquisition effect, which – that $50 million or so of the ACL build on – related to the Dividend Finance production
is something that will continue, as we commented on, strong production expectations for dividend, until that
portfolio reaches a state of maturity.
And so, those ACL builds, ultimately, we'll see what the loss content is to your question on should there be a mild
recession. The Moody's baseline scenario that we utilize, while worse, is not a broad-based persistent decline in
economic activity that would result in a recession. But again, it's certainly worse than last quarter and certainly
worse than the day one build.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. And I think, with that being said, if we sound more cautious, right, I think we probably are just based on
what I read in here. We try to be really consistent, especially as it relates to the alignment of what we talk about
worrying about and how that's reflected in the actions and how we run the company, and to try to be realistic
about what's in front of us.
Like Jamie said, that you look at what's going on in the current environment, Erika, and I – things are – there's a
lot of things to feel optimistic about. And in our particular portfolio, not only do we – as credit obviously has been
great and NCOs are low and NPAs and delinquencies actually came down, the ratios there came down quarter-
over-quarter. We are very mindful of the broader backdrop in attempting to gauge how to position the company for
the next 18 to 24 to 36 months.
And, at least from my point of view, if the goal is to have a company that's great through the cycle, you always
have to be asking yourself, what happens if you're wrong, right? And if we're wrong in this case and we're being
too cautious, maybe we miss 1 point or 2 of loan growth that we otherwise could have gotten, right? But that's
against the backdrop where we've done very well on that measure. Maybe we buy back stock a quarter or two
later than we would have otherwise, and then the ACL drifts down naturally as the scenario outlook changes,
right.
But if we're right to be cautious, on the other hand, the actions we've taken as it relates to the securities portfolio,
the swaps, the total loss absorption Fifth Third has relative to peers, and the fact that we did not take the benefit
that we're getting from NII and spend it in the form of different sorts of investments and otherwise, are going to
pay off very handsomely in terms of performance.
So, one way or the other, like even against this backdrop, I think our return metrics look really good. On a relative
basis, PPNR is going to be up high-teens on a year-over-year basis. I think we feel really good about how the
Bank is positioned.

Good morning. Obviously, bought a lot of securities and added some swaps this quarter and hear you on keeping
securities relatively flat rest of the year. But just kind of as you step back, would you consider yourself fully

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A

Yeah, I would say the investment portfolio is well-positioned and at the level that we would like to manage it long
term. Now, with that said, if we see great opportunities, could we pull forward one quarter or two quarters of cash
flow, which is currently running about $1 billion a quarter? I'm not going to tie my hands and say, I wouldn't take
advantage of great opportunities. But as I sit here today and what rates have done, we feel really good about just
stability from here.

Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the need to protect for lower interest rates. Jamie, is that something
that you spend much time thinking about and is that something that took place?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, that's the story of my life right now. Because in our outlook, we expect the Fed hikes to the 3.25% level.
And then, I saw a research piece the other day that talked about on average or the median of the Fed cuts begin
four months after the last hike. Now, we expect the Fed, in order to tamp down inflation, is really focused on
slowing the economy. So they probably hold for a longer period of time than that median, and hold at that
whatever the peak level is.
And so, frankly, that could tip things over into a recession, maybe not. But at a minimum, there will be rate cuts
down the road, and rate cuts are ultimately the most detrimental activity to a bank's balance sheet if left

unprotected. And therefore, everything we've done over the past couple of years has been building for that time
that the Fed does move and we have a rate decline.
And so, we've added duration to the portfolio again this quarter. It's up to 5.7 years. We increased the bullet,
locked out cash flows to 67%. We grew the portfolio to $55 billion. We added $10 billion in swaps. And then, as
Tim pointed out, in his comments, we've added some fixed rate loan platforms to our business model, and that
should also be helpful should rates decline.
So, yes, we spend a lot of time on that, and I think we have a very, very good team to be able to help manage
through that environment. And certainly, deposit generation activities are very helpful, especially from the retail
footprint as those are the low-cost, stable funding that banks like to enjoy.
