Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Adrienne. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to
report first quarter results to lay the strong foundation for 2024. First quarter 2024, net income was $285 million or
$2.03 per diluted share. Excluding the FDIC charge, first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.08, up 3%
from the fourth quarter. We grew average assets during the quarter with average loans up 1%. We continue to
grow residential mortgage, driven by our differentiated mortgage product. Average C&I balances were higher and
commercial real estate loans remained flat. We grew average deposits by $2 billion to a new record level,
reflecting the success of our branch based Lunar New Year CD campaign.
During the quarter, we payoff $4.5 billion of BTFP while reducing our total borrowings by $1 billion. We also took
an opportunity to invest excess cash into Ginnie Mae floating rate securities. Our asset quality remains solid and
credit is performing as expected. First quarter annualized net charge-offs were up by 2 basis points to 17 basis
points. The non-performing assets ratio was 23 basis points at quarter end. We continue to proactively manage
our credit risk. We added 10% to our commercial real estate loan allowances, bringing our total allowance for loan
losses to 1.29%. These efforts continue to drive shareholder value with an 18% return on tangible common equity
and a 1.6% return on average assets. Tangible book value per share also grew 2% quarter-over-quarter and 14%
year-over-year. Our first quarter results speak to the strength of our diversified business model and our
conservatively managed balance sheet. Looking forward, we remain focused on serving our customers and
growing relationships and are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2024 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on our first quarter financial performance. Chris?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. Turning to loans on slide 4, let me comment on the trends in each of our major lending
categories. First, demand for residential mortgage proved relatively durable, despite seasonal slowdowns. Even
with the generally elevated rate environment, we continue to add residential mortgage loans in Q1 and we're
pleased to see both our residential and home equity pipelines strengthening going into the second quarter.
Second, average C&I balances grew 2%, driven in part by an uptick of utilization we saw at the end of the fourth
quarter. On a period end basis, balances declined, but that was really driven primarily by decreases in capital call
line usage and drops in our Hong Kong portfolio. Based on our current pipeline, we expect C&I growth to pick up
in Q2. Third, average CRE balances remain flat while period end CRE balances were down for the quarter. We
continue to work with our longstanding relation clients, but we are targeting only modest CRE growth for 2024.
Slide 5 summarizes trends in our securities portfolio. During the first quarter, we took steps to enhance our
liquidity profile by putting our cash to work in high-quality liquid assets. We added short duration Ginnie Mae
floaters at a rate of SOFR+ 115, much of which settled towards the end of the quarter. With the purchase of these
securities, the book yield of our portfolio rose 67 basis points to 3.61% at quarter end. Our cash and securities
portfolio rose to 23% of total assets, a level of on balance sheet liquidity we see as appropriate at our current size.
Moving on to deposits on slide 6. As Dominic mentioned, we grew deposits to record levels this quarter with
average growth of 4% or $2 billion and nearly $2.5 billion on a period end basis. We saw growth in retail,
commercial and across all geographies. This growth reflects the focus and dedication of our bankers and the
loyalty and resilience of our broad base of customers base. Looking forward, we continue to focus on adding
granular consumer and business deposits. During the quarter, we also put up $3.5 billion of floating rate, federal
home loan bank advances at a cost of SOFR+ approximately 20 basis points. These advances have a laddered
maturity schedule with $1.5 billion maturing in the next 12 months and the balance over 2025.
Slide 7 covers our net interest income trends. Q1 dollar net interest income was $565 million, while our net
interest margin was 3.34%. The margin compressed more than expected as we decided to extend and upsize our
CD campaign. Time deposits accounted for much of the NIM impact of 14 basis points. We expect further NIM
compression in Q2 as deposit mix shift continues in this higher for longer environment. Nonetheless, as we move
through the year, we expect an acceleration of asset growth will lead to more NIM stability and a bottoming of the
NIM later in the second half of the year.
And now, I'll hand the call over to Irene to talk about asset quality.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. And good afternoon to all on the call. As you can see from slide 8, the asset quality of our
portfolio continues to broadly outperform the industry with credit beginning to normalize. As Dominic mentioned,
we recorded net charge-offs of 17 basis points in the first quarter or $23 million. Quarter-over-quarter non-
performing assets rose by 7 basis points to 23 basis points of total assets.
The increase in commercial real estate was driven by two credits, one construction and one office property.
Nonetheless, the absolute levels remain relatively low. The criticized loans ratio increased during the quarter to
2.3% of loans. The special mention loans ratio also increased 28 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 1.05% of
loans. And the classified loans ratio increased 15 basis points to 1.25%. We recorded a lower provision for credit
losses of $25 million in the first quarter, compared with $37 million for the fourth quarter given the resilient

economic environment and current CECL outlook. We remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risks.
As we look forward, we continue to expect quarterly net charge-offs to be in the range of 15 basis points to 25
basis points.
Turning to slide 9. The total allowance for loan losses increased $1 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily
reflecting a $21 million increase in our allowance for loan losses for commercial real estate loans. Specifically, we
increased the reserve for office by $6 million, bringing the coverage ratio to 273 basis points for office loans. We
believe we are adequately reserved for the content of our loan portfolio given the current economic outlook.
Turning to slide 10. All of East West regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for
well capitalized institutions and well above regional and national bank averages. East West common equity Tier 1
capital ratio stands at a robust 13.5% while the tangible common equity ratio stayed relatively flat at 9.3%. These
capital levels place us among the most well capitalized banks in the industry. East West repurchased 1.2 million
shares of common stock during the first quarter for approximately $82 million at just under $70 a share. We
currently had $89 million of repurchase authorization that remains available for future buybacks. East West also
redeemed $117 million of trust preferred securities in the first quarter. East West second quarter 2024 dividend
will be payable on May 17, 2024, to stockholders of record on May 3, 2024.
I will now turn the call back to Chris to share our outlook for the 2024 full year. Chris?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene. Our full year outlook has shifted slightly. Let me highlight the changes. We now assume a
resilient first half with the economy beginning to soften later in the year. We now expect rate cuts to begin in Q3.
We expect loan growth to pick up in the second quarter and for end of year loan growth to still be in the range of
3% to 5%, buoyed by continued strength in our residential mortgage and a growing C&I portfolio. Given fewer
expected rate cuts, we're raising our net interest income guidance and now only expect a decline in the range of
2% to 4%, up from our prior guidance.
With that, I will now open the call for questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] If you could
please limit to one question and one follow-up question, please rejoin the queue if you have any further questions.
The first question comes from Jared Shaw with Barclays. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Just looking at margin and NII, I guess, what's holding you back from being more up optimistic there? You're
seeing loan growth. You have the securities, the tailwind from securities. Is that just all being absorbed by higher
expected deposit costs. Maybe just walk us through some of that would be great?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So for the record, we are raising our NII guidance for the year. And so, I think we are a little more optimistic here
as we move into the rest of the year. That has been said, yes, we expect more deposit mix migration if we stay in
a higher for longer environment. And that seems to be what we're sort of on pace for here for the second quarter.
So, we'll give some of that up in the deposit mix and the cost of deposits. And I would also remind you that late in
March, we refinanced the BTFP and that had been at a very attractive level. And we obviously replaced that
largely with the CD campaign balances, but those are of a higher cost. So, there's an inherent drag from that
refinancing that's just baked in. And the federal home loan bank advances are also at a slightly higher cost, of
course.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up, just looking at capital, even with the buyback and the
redemption of the trust preferred, we're still seeing CET1 grow higher. How should we be thinking about sort of
upper limits of capital, where you feel comfortable with the upper limits of capital and would the buyback be the
primary way to limit or control that given the loan growth expectation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We've commented that we thought TCE was a relevant measure for us to focus in on and we're focused in on
maintaining that and no longer warehousing additional capital. And so, we'll be proactive in all the actions.

Operator: The next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, I wanted to follow up on the margin. So, Chris, if I'm reading,
understanding you correctly, you do expect more negative mix shift on the funding side. I get the BTFP and the
borrowings, but what about DDA mix? What does your guide assume in terms of how much more attrition there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Look, we're still at 25%, even as we sit here today, April 19th, 20th. So, we feel comfortable that, that number has
come down reasonable and it will probably bottom somewhere in the mid-20s area, which we might be close to. I
think it's a function of how we see the outlook shift as we move later into the quarter. Our expectation previously
had been that when the Fed started to lower rates, we would see that deposit migration ease. Fed hasn't started
to lower rates yet. So, that is continuing sort of month over month as we move through and it's somewhat outlook
dependent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just switching to credit, I guess, Irene, for you, you guys are sticking with your guidance
on loss rates despite some decent migration trends. We've seen that from other banks. Just wondering, what
gives you the confidence to keep the – a rather benign loss guide given these migration trends?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. I think when we look at it and a granular level, loan by loan, loan review that we're doing,
we're very comfortable as far as the reserving that we are doing, the grounds up kind of analysis of the portfolio
and on the charge-offs and our guidance. I think quite honestly, it's in my mind kind of a wide range if you look at
it quarter-by-quarter, but reflects kind of our views and our understanding of the portfolio today, right.

Operator: The next question comes from Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just back on the capital. Should we just assume that you mentioned, I think the TCE
ratio or CET1 ratio sort of flat lines from here since you're focused on those going forward and whatever you guys
need to do in buybacks to sort of solve for that, we should just expect to see some kind of a quarterly buyback
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we're going to obviously use our balance sheet to support our customers and lending growth will still be the
primary use of capital and that will continue to be the case. To the extent, lending growth perhaps is a little softer,

East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
maybe as it was in Q1, we might add securities and that can also manage that number. We'll continue to pay a
strong dividend and buybacks is always sort of our last choice, but one that we have the flexibility to
opportunistically call upon when we see the right environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, what's the impact of a rate cut now on your NII. I know you'd
mentioned something like $1.5 million to $2 million a month last quarter. Does that range still work? And I know
you mentioned bottoming – and then bottoming in the second half of the year. If you had to guess, is that 3Q or
4Q and what's the timing of NII bottoming, does that coincide with that? Or could that actually bottom a little bit
sooner because of growth? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, yes, I believe both the third and the fourth quarter in the second half and I believe it'll bottom somewhere in
the second half. With regard to sort of NII, we do think – follow that same trend and also similarly on a dollar
basis, likely comes back stronger towards the end of the year. And our actual NII sensitivity has increased in part
because we added cumulatively over $2 billion of floating rate securities and that just introduces a little more
sensitivity. And so, it's closer to $3 million [ph] per cut (00:19:16) as we look forward now.

Good afternoon, Ben.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I was curious, it was obviously a big quarter on deposit growth, largely due to the specialty brand. I was curious,
are you seeing any other deposit trends just outside of that Lunar New Year special and anything we might see
kind of extrapolating what you've seen now into 2Q or possibly the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think broadly speaking, we are pleased to see commercial, consumer and our overseas customers all contribute
to the growth in the broad spectrum of deposits. From a product side, we saw growth in interest bearing checking,
money market and time deposits. So, essentially, as long as there is some yield, the customers are willing to
reallocate the portfolio and see the balances. Obviously, the downside to that is, we saw shrinkage in the non-
interest bearing DDA, and I think that's the fundamental migration that we're all zeroed in on and trying to make
sure we understand how that continues to evolve in this higher for longer context.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. And [ph] then I know (00:20:37) on the guidance, this question is a bit nuanced. So, it
says picking up loan growth in Q2. And I hate to ask, but is it fair to think that average balance sheet is pretty
minimal and it's more kind of a late June or do you think it ramps throughout the entire quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We see evidence of positive trends in our pipelines. And so, we think we'll see positive trends pick up here in Q2.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Can you talk about the drivers for loan growth from here? And I know you'd note that it should pick up in 2Q. And
then in your broader macro outlook, you called out a resilient first half with a softening economy in the second
half. Can you talk about, why you're expecting the economy to soften in the second half? And if it doesn't, is there
some upside to those loan growth numbers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So, I think we're following our cues from the Fed. And the Fed has said that they're proactively planning to
engineer a softer landing. And so, that seems to be baked into the forward curve. And given that context, that's
the environment that we're assuming. The reason we're confident we'll see the loan growth pick up is really driven
by our own interactions with our customers and the pipelines that we see.
So, we expect to see C&I growth happens because we have term sheets and conversations that would lead us to
expect that those are going to close. We expect to see residential come through because we know those loans
are in the pipeline. They're already there and they're just in the process of moving through to close. And so, we'll
see residential growth, we'll see C&I growth. And again, we're not focused on CRE growth, but we may see some
of that too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe a follow-up on the question on criticized assets. I know it's similar to what we've seen at peers,
but I guess one point of difference is that you did also have the criticized assets in the CRE book rise, which we
haven't seen at many peers. So, I was wondering if you can just shed some light over all, was this a deep dive

that you did? How comfortable are you with those credits? And why not move the loan loss reserve up a little bit
given this higher level of criticized assets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. So, with the criticized assets movement for commercial real estate, I would say it's pretty
broad based. There is isn't one sector, industry or geography that we are more concerned about. And maybe
more importantly, we do not believe we have concentrations of risk areas we're very concerned with.
On the calculation and the allowance calculation, as you know, there are some confines as far as CECL model
and we've disclosed this in the past as far as the fact that for CECL, for us, we use a multi-scenario approach. So,
I think that gives me comfort as far as it's a little bit more heavily weighted to a downside scenario. With that said,
I think with things that are feasible for us with the qualitative and the quantitative reserve, that's something on the
qualitative side, we want to make sure that we continue to add if appropriate. And that's what you've seen a little
bit happen in this quarter.

Operator: The next question comes from Brandon King with Truist. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. I noticed there was a healthy pickup in loan yields in the quarter. So, I was wondering if
that's a reasonable pace to expect over the next few quarters and if there's anything to call out there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
No, I think obviously our residential mortgages are coming on at a higher rate than the portfolio, and that's
additive. Broadly speaking, our commercial yields and the new loan volume pricing is roughly in line with where
it's been and there's not a material uptick.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then on the CD – for CDs, when you look at your repricing and maturity schedule, at what point are
CDs rolling over to maybe a stable rate? And maybe when or if that kind of turns into a tailwind, maybe in the
back half of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, we'll see, $4 billion to $5 billion of CDs roll over each quarter over the next couple of quarters.
Obviously, we just put on the $2.5 billion of the Lunar CD Special and that will come off in the third quarter. So,
the third quarter is the heavy quarter. And that's – we're anticipating that there might be some rate movements
that happened in the third quarter and that will play into that.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just a follow-up on credit, like on slide 19, I think where you disclosed 47% of CRE customers have
interest – derivative contract, I guess hedging them against higher rates. Just talk to us in terms of the deep dive
of the portfolio reviews that you've done. If we are in a higher for longer over the next two years, how much risk
within that CRE book increases, as these derivative contracts, I'm assuming at some point roll off? And just how
you assess that in terms of the potential risk exposure tied to the book? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure, Eb. So, the good news is most of our customers put on swaps to the maturity of their loan. And so, there
really isn't a significant inter maturity rate rollover risk on the vast majority of them. So, that risk for us is highly
contained and that's by design and the way we market the solution to our customers. We have been steadily
growing the fixed rate portfolio, the other side of that chart. And the combination means that as we think about the
future, we're locking in more and more fixed rate as we move towards the expectation that there might be a
downdraft in rates in the future.
And the swaps, that we put on to hedge our balance sheet, have all been received fixed forwards. And so to the
extent that in 2025, we're staring at inherently a lower rate environment. And today, we think that combination of
factors will all play into our benefit. Our customers who have locked in will be perfectly fine, continue to be
perfectly fine through maturity and our balance sheet, we will be more fixed and receiving more fixed and what we
expect to be a declining rate outlook, which we think is to our benefit and our shareholders' benefit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And this gives us a perspective, Chris, in terms of when these loans are coming up for maturity, what's
happening, are they [ph] reifying (00:28:03) into another sort of fixed rate loan on this balance sheet or how many
of these are moving out, getting [ph] reified (00:28:10) by insurance companies, et cetera?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we see the gamut of activity. The good news is there's a high history here of relatively low LTV lending.
And so, there's plenty of equity for these guys to always find another outlet, if not with backed with us.

No, I got it. Okay. But in terms of, I guess, asking the capital question a little bit differently, you commented about
buybacks, but should we be thinking about perhaps more liquidity but at a lower NIM producing higher NII? It's
kind of a dynamic of what you're doing to the balance sheet right now?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Probably the implication of what we did in the first quarter for sure, and that will play itself out. But we're optimistic
that we'll see loan growth pick up in the second quarter and continue to drive towards the loan guidance that
we've laid out. And we think that will contribute to, again, helping the NIM bounce back later in the year while still
growing NII.

I just want to follow up on the loan growth funding question. I guess understanding the sort of backdrop of the
HQLA build, how much of a willingness do you have to actually use some of the cash to fund the loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So, the investment portfolio will throw off $450 million per quarter of net proceeds. And so, we think that is
part of how we could fund some of the growth as we look forward.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of just the tradeoff between putting on the CDs at very competitive rates
versus FHLB, is that going to be a simple always CD preference? Or how do you think about that sort of funding
mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, look, I think we obviously know the FHLB is there for us. We clearly would rather pay at the margin our
customers a better rate than borrow from a wholesale institution. And we think that is both a better economic
outcome and a better outcome for the franchise and the value that we create for our customers. So, there is a
preference there, but I think we'll look to optimize our cost of funding in the ordinary course and do incrementally
the right thing as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Maybe just I'll add one thing. The [ph] FHLB (00:31:23) we put on, is the variable rate. So, that's also was a part
of the analysis for us.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Yeah. Just wanted to understand, given East West capital positioning, the market disruption, just talk to us in
terms of investment and banker hiring, like how fertile is it to attract talent and maybe move market share in a
world where overall growth may be slow? Thank you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2024
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
The question on investment in talent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think that we will – we're always on the lookout. In fact, for new talent to join the organization. And frankly,
with what happened 12 months ago, there is a lot of disruption in the market. And so, we do feel that there are
plenty of talents out there in the market that are possibly looking for new homes. But we've been very, very
selective because it's not every banker that fit into the East West Bank culture. It's not every banker that actually
like to do the things that we do. And oftentimes, if you look at it, is that there are a lot of banks out there that have
bankers that habitually do much bigger loans, and that doesn't fit into our diversification strategy.
And so, we are going to continue to be very selective and choosy in terms of making sure we find the right fit. And
when we do find the right fit, we are absolutely – we'll be delighted to welcome them to be part of the East West
Bank family. And this is something that we're not going to be rushing to it. And I do notice that there are other
banks who may be all looking into getting a big group of talent from specific bank that are having some turmoil.
We don't necessarily feel that, that is going to be actually an attractive strategy for East West Bank. We have
been able to grow organically pretty nicely for the last, almost 10 years now that we have not made an acquisition
since January of 2014. And even that was a very small acquisition.
So, most of our growth for the last 10 years and it's been through organic direction. So, we like that approach and
we think that bringing the right talent, understanding the East West specific value proposition and understand that
the importance of a balance between risk management and also growth. And those are the people that fit into us
well and then we will continue to identify these type of talents and bring them on.
