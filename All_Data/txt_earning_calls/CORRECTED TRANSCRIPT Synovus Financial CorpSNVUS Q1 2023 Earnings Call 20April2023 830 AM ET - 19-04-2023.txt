Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Cal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. This last
quarter has proven to be a challenging operating environment for the banking industry. However, once again, we
have seen the value and viability of Main Street banks like ours, who operate on a relationship-based client
model.
Despite the media narrative that deposit outflows were rampant in regional banks. Our core deposit balances
were up in the first quarter and stable in the month of March, a testament to the value of our client base and our
team members who serve as trusted advisors in both good and challenging times. We have a long and proven
track record of success. In recent years, we've taken a deliberate approach to expanding our business,
diversifying our client base, and leveraging technology and new solutions to improve the client experience and
deepen our share of wallet. But we have never lost sight of the value of building strong, trusted client
relationships. Trust is a two-way street and is often tested during times of stress. This last quarter serves as an
added proof point of the importance of client loyalty and the engagement of team member base that was
instrumental in efficiently executing a multifaceted response to the turbulence in our industry.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
As a result of our team members' efforts, we're pleased to report strong financial results for the first quarter, with
net income up 19% year-over-year. We also received industry-wide recognition, including ranking number one for
customer satisfaction and trust in the Southeast according to J.D. Power's most recent US Retail Banking
Satisfaction Study and received 20 Greenwich Excellence and Best Brand Awards for Small Business and Middle
Market Banking.
While we're proud of these results, we're mindful of the challenges and uncertainties, but also the opportunities
that lie ahead. The recent bank failures and industry-wide pressures on liquidity serve as a reminder of the
importance of strong deposit production, maintaining a strong capital position, managing risk carefully, and
remaining vigilant in an ever-changing regulatory environment. We increased our core deposit production
significantly this quarter, but also fortified our liquidity position out of abundance of caution through the addition of
broker deposits and FHLB borrowings. And we currently maintain over $25 billion in incremental contingent
liquidity. Also, we continue to accrete capital consistent with our strategy over the last several quarters.
Finally, in the middle of the market upheaval seen in March, we kept our eye on the ball and continued to execute
our strategic plan in a cost effective manner that provides the maximum value for our shareholders. One
noteworthy event was the regulatory approval of the Qualpay investment, which is a supporting component in the
delivery of our Banking-as-a-Service platform.
This quarter's results reinforce the strength of our balance sheet with growth in deposits, cash balances as well as
other contingent sources of liquidity. Moreover, our AOCI improved, net charge-offs remained at historically low
levels, and we grew our tangible book value per share. Before we transition to the next slide and our financial
highlights, I would like to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts since early March and thank our clients for
the trust you continue to place in us.
Now let's move to slide 4 for the quarterly financial highlights. Net income available to common shareholders and
EPS were up 19% and $0.21 respectively year-over-year. Strong earnings growth was supported by 23% year-
over-year growth in NII and 19% growth from core client fee income. This revenue growth combined with year-
over-year positive operating leverage led to strong performance metrics with ROATCE of 21.9%, return on
average assets of 1.36%, and an efficiency ratio of 52.3%.
Loans increased $329 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter. Core commercial loans again served as the primary
driver of growth, offset by runoff of third-party consumer loans and a previously disclosed move of third-party
loans to held-for-sale. Loan growth ex-third-party's move to held-for-sale was $753 million or 2% quarter-over-
quarter. Overall, deposits grew 2% quarter-over-quarter, including growth in core deposits of $133 million. Core
deposits remain stable through the month of March and we saw minimal outflows related to the industry
narratives. Our deposit origination engine remains strong as we once again saw record levels of deposit
production. Despite headwinds associated with noninterest-bearing deposit remixing and higher cost associated
with core interest-bearing deposits, deposit rates have tracked reasonably in line with our expectations, though
current dynamics are presenting some upward pressures relative to our previously guided range.
Our underlying credit performance remains strong, and while we are seeing movement away from historically low
levels, we have not seen a meaningful change in the underlying performance of our borrower base. Our positive
portfolio performance is reflected and continued low levels of charge-offs, as well as our other performance
metrics, such as delinquencies and non-performing ratios.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
The ACL ratio increased slightly this quarter, predominantly due to higher weightings to downside economic
scenarios. Lastly, CET1 grew to 9.76%, a result of strong organic capital generation and our decision to continue
to retain and grow capital in this uncertain environment.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jamie to continue the overview of our quarterly results in greater detail. Jamie?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. I might have begun with loan growth as seen on slide 5. Total loan balances ended the first
quarter at $44 billion, reflecting growth of $329 million or $753 million when excluding the previously mentioned
move to held-for-sale. Growth was again led by our commercial businesses with CRE and C&I growth of $346
million and $534 million respectively.
Similar to last quarter, CRE growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low level of
payoffs. While C&I growth was diversified across multiple industries and business lines. When examining our C&I
utilization rate quarter-over-quarter, the increase is a function of higher utilization associated with newly originated
credits rather than an increase from existing customers.
When looking out over a longer period, our increasing C&I utilization rate is a function of our changing lending
mix, which has shifted to larger clients. We did not see any meaningful changes in utilization or emergency draws
as a result of the recent market disruption. We are judiciously originating new credit to serve our core clients and
also to gain market share in our most attractive commercial business lines.
We are also mindful of ensuring new loans are originated at attractive risk adjusted returns, as shown through our
spreads to index, which remain elevated relative to 2022 levels. Overall, pipelines and activity remain muted due
to lower transaction activity. And as Kevin will describe later, we expect the pace of core loan growth to decline as
the year progresses.
Turning to slide 6. Core deposit balances grew $133 million, quarter-over-quarter, and we saw continued increase
in deposit production with both commercial and consumer business lines contributing to the growth. While the
current approach to monetary policy continue to be pressure balances and the events of March created
uncertainty in the banking environment, our relationship banking model proved to be resilient. Looking at the
composition of the quarterly change in balances, noninterest bearing deposits were down $997 million quarter-
over-quarter, a byproduct of commercial seasonality, normal cash deployment and to a lesser extent, the
continued pressures from the higher rate environment.
The decline in M&A and increase in CDs were interrelated as consumers shifted excess liquidity between the two
account types. Our increase in broker deposits was primarily the result of a conservative approach to proactively
source additional funding late in the quarter, which I will touch on in a moment. As we look at deposit rates, our
average cost of deposits increased 56 basis points in the first quarter to 1.44%, which equates to a cycle-to-date
total deposit beta of approximately 30% through Q1.
Our deposit cost and betas were impacted by the decline in DDA as well as anticipated pricing lags on core
interest-bearing deposit costs. Today, deposit pricing has generally evolved in a manner consistent with our
expectations. However, recent remixing trends, along with an FOMC that appears to be biased to hold at or above
5%, will likely result and through the cycle betas which track in the low 40% area.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Moving to slide 7. Taking a closer look into deposit balance trends within the quarter. As Kevin mentioned
previously, our core deposit balances remain relatively stable throughout the month of March. However, we did
take precautionary measures in early March and built up our cash balances through increased use of broker
deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings. To further augment contingent liquidity sources, we continue to
proactively pledge additional collateral to the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve. And as of April
17, we currently maintain over $25 billion of contingent liquidity across a diverse set of sources, which includes
immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice.
And as we flip to slides 8 and 9, you can see we added additional details around the composition of our core
deposit base, which highlights our relationship-centric portfolio and which supports the stability we experienced in
recent weeks. Looking through the key characteristics of our deposits, you can see both the diversity of our
balances across commercial and consumer client types as well as the long tenure of our relationships. And given
the industry focus around uninsured deposits, I would simply highlight that over 70% of our deposits are either
insured, collateralized or could be insured by switching to an ICS account to existing capacity.
Now to slide 10. Net interest income was $481 million in the first quarter, an increase of 23% versus the like
quarter one year ago and a decline of 4% from Q4. The year-over-year increase was supported by the benefits of
our asset sensitive balance sheet as well as substantial loan growth over the last 12 months. When looking at
quarter-over-quarter, NII was negatively impacted by approximately $9 million associated with lower day count.
The asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from both higher balances and rates. However, as I
spoke previously, the cyclical lags in deposit pricing combined with the remixing within our NIB deposit portfolio
served as a notable headwind for the quarter. Those same dynamics were evident as we look back at the margin
for Q1. With higher cash balances also serving to weigh on NIM by approximately 2 basis points during the
quarter. And as the environment has stabilized, we are working toward more normalized cash balances and, thus,
the associated impact to NIM should reverse in the coming quarters.
Looking forward to Q2, we expect NII to continue to be pressured. Specifically, we will see a full quarter impact of
the deposit mix shift that occurred in the first quarter, as well as the continued headwind resulting from deposit
price lags. The combination of these headwinds is expected to lead to NII declines in Q2, followed by relative
stability for the remainder of the year consistent with our full-year guidance.
Slide 11 shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of $118 million, up $17 million from the previous quarter and up
$11 million year-over-year. This quarter's adjusted fee income performance is the highest in recent history, even
accounting for the elevated mortgage environment we experienced in 2020 and 2021. The performance speaks to
the investments we have made across our franchise with core client fee income, excluding mortgage, increasing
19% year-over-year.
Our wealth management franchise grew 22% year-over-year despite what continues to be a challenging equity
market. The diversity of our wealth revenue streams, including short-term liquidity management products,
continues to drive strong growth. Capital markets also recognized its strongest quarter on record, with a revenue
of $14 million, a 151% increase year-over-year. Syndication fees as well as interest rate management products
drove the strong quarter, further signs that our commercial franchise continues to grow through enhanced product
offerings and the expansion of our middle market line of business.
As we look to the remainder of 2023, we do expect core client fee income to decline from Q1 levels as slower
economic activity will impact capital markets fees and we also begin to implement changes to our consumer
checking products. Total noninterest revenue for Q1 was impacted by a $13 million onetime benefit associated
with the regulatory approval of our Qualpay investment.

Moving on to expenses. Slide 12 highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of $304 million, down $3 million
from the prior quarter and up $25 million year-over-year, representing a 9% increase. As we look quarter-over-
quarter, adjusted expenses were well-managed. Increases in seasonal personnel expense and planned increases
in FDIC and healthcare cost were offset by lower performance-related expenses and controlled core operating
cost.
When segmenting our year-over-year increase in expenses, the growth is attributable to the three buckets we
provided in our guidance for the year: first, new business initiatives such as Maast and CIB; second, core
operating expenses, including investments in and expansion of our workforce; and third, costs associated with our
FDIC assessment rate and healthcare costs. Our first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio of 50.5% continues to
highlight that these expense increases are supported through our growing revenue base. Total noninterest
expense was negatively impacted by a $17 million loss associated with the move of third-party loans to held-for-
sale.
Moving to slide 13, on credit quality. Overall, credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations
remain strong. The NPL ratio moved to 0.41%, net charge-off ratio to 0.17%, and criticized and classified ratio
finished the quarter at 2.47% of total loans. In the first quarter, our ACL was $514 million or 1.17% of loans, a
modest increase of 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. The deterioration in the forecasted economic scenarios
in 2023 and 2024 negatively impacted the ACL ratio offset by the continuing strong performance of the overall
portfolio.
While we do expect additional pressure on credit metrics due to the economic environment, we continue to have
confidence in the strength and quality of our portfolio. We continue to be vigilant, while monitoring the more
recession sensitive components of our loan book. And we utilize rigorous underwriting parameters and exhaustive
market and portfolio analysis, not only for these sectors, but for the entirety of the loan portfolio.
Given the increased interest in the office sector, we have included additional color on our office portfolio in the
appendix. What you will see is an office book with low maturity and lease rollover risk that is primarily medical,
secured by modern properties and reflective of our footprint superior market trends.
As noted on slide 14, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.76%. Within the quarter, core earnings
supported robust capital generation, which was more than sufficient to meet what continue to be solid core
balance sheet growth. We had no share repurchase activity in the first quarter. And in light of the uncertain
economic and regulatory environment, we believe that continuing to grow our CET1 ratio is prudent. As we've
done for the last several quarters, in the near-term, we will continue to focus on retaining capital generated
through earnings to support our core growth while bolstering our balance sheet position.
While not a metric that we manage to given the current environment, it is worth acknowledging the improvement
in our TCE ratio, which increased 28 basis points from Q4, and ended the quarter at 6.12%. Declining market
rates benefited OCI associated with the AFS portfolio and hedges and continued growth in our primary capital
levels from earnings retention also provided support.
I'll now turn it back over to Kevin.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Thanks, Jamie. I'll now continue to our updated guidance for the quarter as shown on slide 15. Given the ongoing
volatility in the economic environment, we continue to utilize wider ranges for our full year 2023 guidance. We
expect loan growth of 4% to 8%. This reduced range accounts for the acceleration of the rundown in our third-
party portfolio, as well as the diminishing demand associated with the economic environment. These effects will
be partially offset by low payoff levels and growth from our newer business lines, such as CIB and expansion in
verticals such as commercial middle market.
The adjusted revenue growth outlook of 4% to 7% aligns with an FOMC that reaches 5.25% in the second
quarter. Changes to the midpoint of our previous guidance are a result of slightly lower loan growth expectations
and deposit remixing, as well as overall deposit betas, which as Jamie mentioned, are expected to be in the low
40s area. Our expense outlook has been adjusted downward to 4% to 6%, with efforts taken to better align with
the new revenue guidance.
We are prudently managing expenses in this environment, while continuing to ensure we do not sacrifice critical
investments that will support our long-term success and shareholder value. The result of our revised revenue and
expense guidance is forecasted PPNR growth of 4% to 8%. Despite a more challenging environment, we are still
committed to year-over-year PPNR growth and generating attractive returns for our shareholders.
Moving to capital. As we have previously communicated, we are targeting a CET1 ratio above our previous
guidance of 9.25% to 9.75%. At this time, we believe it is prudent to build a larger capital buffer given the
uncertain regulatory and economic environment. I believe the forecast represents the resilience and adaptability
of our business model, as well as the power of building strong and loyal client relationships. Our strong financial
results this quarter reflect the hard work and dedication of our team, as well as our commitment to supporting our
clients and communities through these difficult times.
Looking ahead as we see many opportunities for profitable growth and success while continuing to improve our
overall risk profile through increased liquidity and capital and well-managed credit cost. Our strategic investments
coupled with our client-centric approach will continue to differentiate us from our competitors and position us for
long-term success. At the same time, as a Main Street bank, we remain committed to being a trusted partner to
our clients, providing them with the tools and resources they need to achieve their financial goals.
And now, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time,
we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today comes from Brad Milsaps from Piper
Sandler. Brad, your line is open. Please go ahead.

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks for taking my questions and for all the detail in the deck. Maybe I did want to start with credit. I appreciate
all the details. I was curious, I know you guys are constantly running sort of internal stress on different pieces of
the CRE book. Just kind of curious how that's evolved maybe over the last 90 days kind of given all the
transpired. Also I think and here you note that maybe only about a little less than 15% of the office book rolls over
this year. Would that sort of hold for the rest of the CRE book and would just be curious for any color on
conversations you are having, as these loans matures with borrowers kind of what you're doing to shore them up
and just kind of how those conversations are going as we think about credit going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Brad. This is Bob. I'll comment or two and Jamie and Kevin can certainly kick in. But, from a CRE, from
an overall perspective, the matchup on the maturity risk, if you will, is similar. In that in terms of you've got some
duration there, there's probably three years plus for the most part. I do want to make sure that I touch on office for
you because I know that's what, a lot of folks are looking at. But just a couple of points. Number one, in addition to
the data we're showing, when you think about office in the spot metrics today, they're very clean. Average size of
that office portfolio loan is less than $10 million, little to no charge-offs and [indiscernible] (00:24:11) low non-
accruals and even the criticized classified levels today, would be in the 5% range.
Now, with that said, obviously, we're doing a deep dive into that portfolio. We've looked at approximately 70%
coverage of loans, all loans greater than $7.5 million. And the result of that which gives us sort of a watch list, if
you will, of credits of somewhere around 10% to 15% of the office book that we would have some level of concern
about, and I would say some level of future concern about. These loans are still performing, still got, good
commitment by the sponsors, et cetera. So when you start narrowing it down, it's a fairly small quantifiable
percentage of the loan book – of the office book that we think potentially will need to think through as time goes
on. Now, again, that's strictly property performance based on potential lease expiration et cetera. So, from our

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
perspective, even when you dig back into the portfolio, the potential problems in terms of amounts are fairly
manageable. So, I did want to get that out.
We aren't seeing a whole lot of softness in other asset classes, Brad. Multifamily continues to be a good asset
class, albeit with rent rates certainly beginning to move back. But they were so hot for a year or two years, they've
got some cushion there and that's market specific warehouse we feel good about as well there. And retail seems
to be holding fine. And the hotel story as we ran through the pandemic there and they seem to be improving. So,
all in all, our CRE book is in good shape. The office story will play out over several quarters, but we feel like we're
well positioned for it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brad, the one thing I would add to that is, Bob talked about our internal evaluation, but you also have to go
back and look at the Southeast. I mean, the Southeast continues to perform very well. We believe you've seen
some distress in certain asset classes, but it's been very geographical. If you look at the Southeast, we continue
to have rent growth higher than the national average. When you look at specifically our office portfolio, our
criticized and classified ratios are far lower than what some others have shared. Part of that is due to the fact that
we have 50% of our book in medical office, and the remaining portion of that traditional office book is newer
properties in markets that in the Southeast haven't seen the same work at home impact.
So, in general, our update is that although we expect credit metrics to continue to move off of all-time historical
lows, we're not seeing anything systemically including office that gives us greater concerns. On the C&I front, we
look at our cash inflows every month and every quarter. We haven't seen any overall deterioration of any specific
industries. Any NPL inflows that we've had at this point have been onesie-twosie's. And so, we still remain
cautiously optimistic. And to your point, Bob and his team are trying to look at it every different way they can and
ring fence anything that gives us any concerns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. And Brad, I'll just jump in from the allowance perspective and, everything, Bob – as Bob mentioned, we've
done a deep dive on all of these portfolios and looked at all loans of any real size. And all of that is embedded in
our allowance calculation. And so, as Bob mentioned, the 10% to 15%, the watch list on our non-medical office
that is included in the allowance calculation. And what you've seen is on aggregate, the quality of the loan
portfolio has led to a reduced life of loan loss estimate for the past couple of quarters. And so, the aggregate
portfolio has increased. In the first quarter, we did increase the allowance based on the CRE portfolio by a little
less than $20 million. And that's embedded in the move from the 1.15% to the 1.17% ACL ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. I guess this is my follow up, you guys covered a lot there. But you mentioned, as you move up in loan size,
do you also feel like you're moving up sort of in quality of borrower? Can you just kind of give us a little sense of
kind of maybe some of the drivers? But, behind the loan growth, I think you mentioned a couple of times that, or
seeing maybe larger exposures. But, certainly in line with, as you become a larger bank that's pretty natural. Just
curious on any additional color there?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Yeah. So it's we talked about it in terms of how we continue to grow our balance sheet actually allows us to de-
risk the overall balance sheet. And it's just based on the fact that as we're booking more middle market credits, as
we moved into corporate and investment bank, we're more investment grade at credits. And so, when you look at
it from expected loss through our provisioning or just through our risk rating process, it would suggest that the
production that we're putting on today and we put on in previous quarters is, in effect, reducing the overall
expected loss of the portfolio, moving away from, as you suggested, some of these smaller credits that have a
little more volatility and less cushions of protection. And so, this quarter, our loan growth, obviously on the CRE
front was more of a function of fund ups on our construction lines, on multifamily. But on the C&I side, most of the
growth came from middle market, which was about 50% of the growth, which is, for us, we think right down the
middle credits that are going to perform at a very high level. So, that's been our plan in terms of growth as we've
shifted to some of these new specialties and moved up market, that not only are we getting good growth, but
we're also de-risking the portfolio at the same time.

I guess on NII, Jamie, just wanted to follow up on your comment around, I guess a decline in 2Q and then relative
stability in the back half. Just talk to us in terms of the dynamics that you expect from there around, one, the pace
of deposit repricing if let's say, if the Fed is done after the May hike. Like how do you expect deposit costs and
betas? At what point do they stop rising? And remind us of just the asset repricing that you expect back half into
next year?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Yeah. Ebrahim, as we look forward, we do expect to see continued increases in deposit costs as we kind of get to
the end of this tightening cycle. When we think about the timing, just like what we said in January, we do expect
the first quarter to be our highest quarterly increase in total deposit cost. And when you look at that, you can look
at the month of December to March where our cost increased 55 basis point. But thinking about those monthly
increases which we think is probably a better way to look at a little higher frequency data, prior to March, we saw
a steady trend that was right in line with what we had modeled and what we discussed in January. We saw
monthly deposit cost increasing and those increases peaking in November and December. And then in January
and February, we saw steady declines in the rate of increase of total deposit cost along the lines of what we
expected.
Now clearly, March was a little bit of a different story, when we saw the disruption. And so, we did see an increase
there that was actually kind of similar to what we saw in November and December. But the movements that we
saw, the rollover from year-end into early Q1 gives us confidence in our modeling and our expectations going
forward. And so, we do believe that, we will start to see that trend resume from here of slower increases, monthly
increases in total deposit cost. But the March disruption does shift our through the cycle beta higher into the low-
40s. And so, as we look at the second quarter, we do expect to see total deposit costs increase a little less than
50 basis points. That's left in the first quarter and about a 30 basis point increase from the month of March
numbers. And so, that's what we expect to see in the near-term. Then beyond that, we'll continue to see some
marginal increase in deposit costs. But in the second half, the rate of increase declined pretty precipitously.
On the asset side of the balance sheet, in the first quarter, you saw our loan beta with a little more than 60%. We
expect that to continue. And as we mentioned in our forecast, we expect another 25 basis points from the Fed
and we would expect, somewhere in the low-60s as far as loan beta on that. And then progressing through the
year, we think that the pressures from increased deposit costs and the benefits from fixed rate asset repricing will
be fairly well balanced in the second half of the year. And then beyond that, we think there will be just the benefit
of fixed rate asset repricing moving forward, which will be a tailwind to both NII and the margin.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you for talking to that. And just a separate question. So you gave great detail on CRE. I'm just
wondering maybe Bob or Kevin, anywhere else within just the loan book where you're seeing any signs of stress
or pain? And as you think about the back half of the year and the cumulative impact from the Fed hikes like,
where do you see the weakness within your loan portfolio where you expect to be drivers of delinquencies and
losses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, EP. This is Bob. I'll start. Nothing specific. I wouldn't call out a specific industry or category right now. We
certainly been watching our small business portfolio, as we've mentioned in quarters past. And we've seen, some
marginal negative migration there. So, we continue to watch that. On the C&I front, no industry specific that I
would call out. Certainly, we're doing a similar deep dive into our leverage book, which is fairly small like we did in
our CRE book. So, I don't think we're really seeing any specific industries in terms of C&I. In terms of CRE, in
addition to office, obviously multifamily is very market specific. We've got a deep market analytics team that that
does an awful lot of analysis. And that's probably going to be more market specific. But we still have a lot of
strong economic sort of tailwinds of migration and lack of housing supply, particularly in our markets that are still
kind of providing a little buoyance to the multifamily book. So, I don't see it there. I think it'll be sporadic and
dependent upon those companies that are still struggling with input cost and labor cost.

And EP, great answer by Bob. I just – it's interesting when we look at any of the troubled credits that we've seen
in the last several quarters, what to me is the only commonality is most of these businesses had challenges prior
to the pandemic. And in many ways some of the cash around PPP and the ability to manage through the last
several years, kind of bottom time. But as they come out of the other side, they're returning to some tough
business models or they're having some challenges. And so, instead of new credit issues arising, I think what
we're seeing or some of these companies that struggle in the past that were able to make it with the additional
liquidity are back to struggling again. That seems like that's a common theme.

Operator: The next question is from Steve Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. My first question on slide 9, you provided great detail into the
composition of the deposit base. I'm curious, early on in March, what were the conversations like behind the
scenes with your largest uninsured depositors? After the two bank failures in March, was there much concern or
panic among these depositors after what they saw happen to SVB and Signature?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, Tony, it's hard to understand or gauge what their panic was. I think there was a lot of false narratives
happening around the industry trying to understand whether this was a bank crisis or whether there were three
banks that they had an individual crisis. And I don't think that those three banks that failed constitute an overall
bank crisis. But those conversations led to a lot of calls to our bankers and, in many situations, our outreach to
some of our largest depositors. And the conversations were trying to understand how that impacted us.
And from our standpoint, our first goal was to explain that we are very different than the three institutions that
failed. We have a very diverse, granular deposit base as you can see in the deck. We're not homogeneous as it
relates to where we were funding the balance sheet. And so, having those conversations and, most importantly,
the long-term relationships that we've had with these clients, you can see that, not only as our average tenure for
our top 100 depositor is 20 years, but if you look at the entire book, the dollar-weighted average is 18 years. So,
we've developed long-term relationships built on trust. And so, when we had those discussions, we were able to
keep our deposits on balance sheet.
We do have a product that you've heard about, the insured cash sweep product that we've offered prior to this
little mini crisis. And we had a whopping total of about 60 clients for less than $500 million move into that product.
So, I think that serves as a testament that people didn't feel compelled that they had to move their deposits into
that sweep arrangement and that they were very comfortable with Synovus continuing to safeguard their liquidity.
But in many ways, there were good, fruitful discussions. And if I had to gauge how much we lost from that, I'd say
less than $100 million in deposits.

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's good color. And a follow-up to that. I mean, on an overall basis, do you feel like the situation has stabilized
and its back to business now? I mean, we've seen a handful of regional banks report earnings so far this week,
and we haven't seen the widespread deposit outflows to money center banks or elsewhere that the media or
others have portrayed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think the questions around liquidity are abating and the questions around profitability are becoming front
and center. So, what we have to do going forward is make sure that as we continue to grow, our asset side of the
balance sheet is that we're conscious of not just growing deposit, but what – deposits, but also what's the cost of
that funding. And so, that's where we're all focused and I think that's where you'll see the industry turn their
attention.
And I think you're also seeing more conversations around balance sheet optimization. Are there asset classes
there that are not self-funded that now in this environment with a prolonged higher rate, interest rate environment
that aren't returning the levels of capital, the hurdle rates that you require. So, I think it'll turn more to profitability
and balance sheet optimization and less about liquidity and concerns of losing liquidity.
Now, I will tell you that I think that there, as you've heard from other banks, there's still a question mark in terms of
how much shift will continue to occur from NIB and interest-bearing and we all can try to model that. What we're
excited about is that we continue to be very successful in our Treasury and Payment Solutions area. Our
production was up 40% again in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And I think that's about the
best vehicle we have to be able to preserve and grow noninterest-bearing deposits. And that's where we're
focused.

some changes in your consumer checking fees. So, service charges in any way to quantify the impact of that
could have on fee income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brady. The decline that we expect in the second quarter is based on the adjusted number and it's really a
function of a slowing economy and slower loan growth leading to less capital markets fees. The first quarter was a
big success for us in capital market fees, a record quarter of $14 million. That's something that as we head into a
likely recession that we don't expect to be sustainable. Now, clearly, it's a big success because this is an area
where we've been investing for some period of time in our commercial businesses. And so, we love to see that.
But there's just going to be a headwind on growth in that area just due to the economy. And so, that's what's
largely driving the decline. I would put the second quarter NII adjusted in somewhere between [ph] $105 million
and $108 million (00:42:02) is probably a good range. And that's how we are thinking about that.
You're right that as we look forward longer-term, changes in our deposit offerings will lead to a headwind on NII
growth. One way to think about that would be approximately $10 million annualized, but that's something that –
the timing is still to be determined and we will give more updates on that as we proceed to the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then, I know a lot has changed from your Investor Day last year. But I know during
that Investor Day, you laid out some targets for 2024 of a 1.3% to 1.4% ROA and a 16% to 17% ROATCE. I think
the Street has [indiscernible] (00:42:53) closer to a 1% ROA next year. So, any comment or update on how you're
thinking about those kind of profitability goals given today's backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I'll let Jamie talk about kind of the numbers, Brady. But I'll take you back to that February Investor Day. And when
we put those out there, we said, look, these absolute numbers that we'll share with you are based on today's rates
and based on what we see over the next three years. And so, as of that period, those numbers were – at were not
only accurate for our forecast, but they were also accurate and that we felt that they would be top quartile. But
what we left with that day was, look, we can't predict the future, but what we can say is that our focus is going to
be continuing to generate improvements in our financial performance that will allow us to be top quartile if rates
are higher. And that means that the returns need to be higher and efficiency ratio and need to be lower than so be
it. But our ultimate goal there was to just say relatively speaking, we want to be in the top 25% and the numbers
will play out as they play out in that timeframe. Based on what we're dealing with now, that may mean that you
reset the bar and you look at some different numbers. But Jamie, how would you think about the actual forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a very interesting thought exercise because when we laid out our multiyear outlook on February 8 of
last year, we had Fed funds approaching 3% three years out. And ironically, if you were to look at the forward
curve today Fed funds is approaching 3%, three years out, but in a very different way. And so, as Kevin
mentioned, our performance metrics really are to be top quartile versus peers and we will pivot as we need given
the environment. And so, while the – while we may end up back at 3% Fed funds in the medium- to longer-term,
we believe that we have a franchise model here that's poised to remain and be top quartile long-term. And so, we
will react to that. Our priorities right now are ensuring that we are positioned to take care of our clients here in the

Southeast, because we still believe that the opportunity here is unique and big. And so, we are positioning our
balance sheet for that, positioning our team for that, and we believe that we will win in that regard. But we're also
convicted on making sure that we do it in a prudent manner and defending the balance sheet. And you see that in
our capital strategy, you see it in our liquidity strategies and you see it in our NII sensitivity hedging, just making
sure that we protect now the income statement and variable in various outlooks. And so, that's our strategy. We're
committed to long-term top quartile and we will adjust as needed.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get a sense for your willingness to
maybe actually accelerate some of your hiring efforts and some of the business build outs that you obviously laid
out at Investor Day. There's a bank the other day that basically said that hiring opportunities are greater than they
could remember in recent times. Just given that, lenders seem to be kind of idle, as demand slows and banks
kind of pull back. Just wanted to get an update on maybe some of those initiatives? And would you actually
consider actually accelerating some of that at the expense of near-term profits? But to position yourselves better
on kind of the other side of whatever sort of cycle we're going to have? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Michael. Obviously, there's disruption in the marketplace and that presents opportunities and that hasn't
changed over the last several years. And you can see from our rest of year guidance, we're continuing to grow
expenses and we think that that will, given our revenue guidance, still allow us to present positive operating
leverage. But we want to make sure that we're opportunistic. We're leaning in. We believe that in times of crisis or
in times like this is when share shifts – shifts hands. And we want to make sure that we take advantage of that.
And that means that we're out there still attracting top talent. We've been adding middle market talent. We have
three additional CIB team members that will be joining us in the next several months when they're finished with
their garden leave. Across our commercial segment, we're adding talent in our high growth markets. And the only
thing that's changing there is we want to make sure that we're putting a higher bar on the individuals that we're
hiring. And I would love to be able to do just not individuals, but to bring over teams. But when we look at the
payback period of a new relationship manager or a new private wealth advisor, we want to make sure that given
that there is probably an economic downturn in our near future, that we are expecting higher levels of talent and

that that NPV is not going to be impacted because we're bringing in actually better talent and they're going to
perform within our expectations. So, yes, we do think there's an opportunity. You won't see us trying to shrink our
way to prosperity. We think there's a tremendous opportunity in the Southeast, and we think talents are big piece
of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Helpful. And then maybe just one on the loan growth guidance. Is the change really just a function of moving the
consumer loans to HFS? I'm sorry if I missed that. But just wanted to get a sense for, kind of what the delta
because it does seem like you have good [indiscernible] (00:48:32) kind of momentum utilization rates up, kind of
et cetera? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, that's obviously, Michael, that's $450 million we moved over there. So that's a component of it. But we also
have seen softening on the demand side. Our pipelines are off about 25% when you look at it across the board.
And that's us being prudent on one side where, CRE pipelines are off 95% versus last year. The growth that we're
seeing there, as I mentioned earlier, really fund up some of our construction lines, but not a lot of new production.
So, that the pipelines are declining. We still think that we'll be able to grow in that mid single-digit level just
because we have so many business units that are fairly new, whether it's expansion of our middle market team,
where we've increased our [ph] RMs (00:49:19) 50% over the last couple of years, our CIB, which grew another
$40 million this past quarter. So, the difference for us is that on the C&I front, we have a lot of new initiatives and
new talent that will continue to produce despite the fact that overall pipelines are diminishing a bit.

Maybe just when we look at the update for higher levels of CET1 and the higher liquidity that's on the balance
sheet. How long should we be thinking you want to retain higher liquidity and capital? I know you said, a lot of it is
due to the current immediacy of the crisis. But should we think that as we go into 2024 where more normalized
levels of liquidity and that, that CET1 ratio could come back down below 10%? Or do you feel this could be a new
normal for a little longer?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we think about capital ratios it's largely dependent on the environment. And so, it depends on the stability of
the outlook and where the economy is, where the banking industry is. There are lot of components that are
outside of the risk inherent on our balance sheet. And so, that's how we think about it. We think that getting to
10% or higher in the near-term makes sense and it's probably safe to think about that as the next year or so. And
then, we're constantly reassessing. But that's generally how we think about it. And that's not a new strategy for us.
The last quarter that our deposits – that our dollars of CET1 decline was at the third quarter of 2019. And since
then, every quarter we have accreted dollars of CET1. We've accreted $1.4 billion of CET1 over that time period,
and we've deployed that to clients in a year in the Southeast. And so, as we think about that strategy, it's really
nothing new for us and that's our intent going forward. And we grew CET1 13 basis points this quarter. We expect
to continue growing that ratio as we get to the 10% area.
But longer-term, when we look at our stress testing, our modeling in a severe adverse scenario, there's nothing
that points us to the magical 10% number. Our math would tell us that you could run with a CET1 lower than that.
And so, we'll assess where we are, where the economic outlook, where peers are as we go forward. But right
now, we're comfortable accreting up to the 10%. We think that's the prudent thing to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow up, you mentioned that you used a higher weighting on an more adverse
scenario for CECL. If you hadn't done that, would we have actually seen either dollars of ACL decline or ratio
decline? And I guess what is that weighting to the more adverse scenario now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So when you – you're right that we did adjust our weightings, you can see that in our table on slide 17, the
weighting change. Basically, our outlook right now continues to align to that slow growth scenario. And it's really
low to no growth on average for the next couple of years. And so, that's the – basically the base case scenario
when you take the weightings consensus baseline would be a positive to the allowance, but we're really aligned to
a slow to no growth scenario for the allowance.

Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I just I know we've had a few questions on credit. Just more general and top level, but I just wanted to if this has
been addressed already, I apologize. But there was a linked quarter increase in non-performers and it looks like
also special mention in substandard. And I'm just wondering if there's any kind of common threat to that? Is that
just more what's happening in the environment? Is it more of a proactive stance? I know, Kevin, earlier you
mentioned about some of the problem credits or ones that were challenged before and just had some lifelines
thrown out from the government now they're still challenged. But just a little more color on any color on what
segments are driving that deterioration that we saw then core? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Kevin. This is Bob. Thanks for the question. As far as NPLs go moved up to 41 basis points. It's really a
handful of credits that we already had rated that kind of moved into non-accrual status at the same time. Again, I
would point to the level of criticized and classified accruing loans behind that is being fairly manageable with no
specific industry or concentration, if you will, geographically speaking – to speak off. So, few credits that were a
little bit larger and then you had just normal migration due to the economic environment in sort of our smaller
business and consumer book. So, when you do the math on that, throw in the larger ones, it pushes you up still
41 basis points about where we were a few quarters back. So, not significantly higher. But certainly, migrating up
as we had mentioned, the bias is still probably for negative migration, although is certainly within our
expectations.
In terms of charge-offs, I kind of felt like that's what you're asking as we were going forward. Those will eventually
– they will work their way back up to some level of what you may call normalization. I tend to think that if you go
back pre-pandemic and we were in the 25 to 30 basis point range, if you will, that probably feels okay, although is
certainly subject to quarterly swings, particularly if you have some larger credits. But all in all, that's what's driving
the slight increase in those numbers. Kevin [indiscernible] (00:56:17).

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Great. Great. Thanks. One quick follow up. Just there was a lot of focus a number of weeks ago on
underlying losses within held to maturity. You guys have been pretty exclusively, I think exclusively available for
sale. And just maybe if you can touch on the trade-offs in that approach and whether that may – whether that
could or would change going forward? Thanks.

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You're right. We're 100% available for sale. As we thought about the use of held to maturity, we believe that it
really had more negatives than positives where it limits your ability to trade the securities and all you get as a
change in the accounting treatment. And so, there's no economic benefit outside of the appearance of AOCI on
the balance sheet and in tangible common equity.

And so, we did not choose or elect to put any securities in held to maturity. It has been an interesting time over
the past quarter as this has become a focus and looking at AOCI and comparing the unrealized losses with and
without held to maturity. For us, as we reflect on the use of it, we still believe that it is an accounting treatment that
doesn't really change anything, but it does provide a limitation on your ability to manage your balance sheet. And
so, it's not that attractive.
When it becomes attractive would be if there was a change in the regulatory environment where you had to
include AOCI in regulatory capital ratios. And if that happened and held to maturity securities were excluded from
that, then that would materially change the view around the benefits of using the held to maturity designation.
Clearly, there's no clarity around that, what will happen there and how that will play out. But that's generally how
we think about it. But to-date, we're very comfortable with where we are with our securities portfolio. We're very
comfortable with the unrealized losses in that portfolio. You saw some improvement quarter-on-quarter in that.
And we will await to see if there are any changes on the regulatory side to the treatment of AOCI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
But, Jamie, do you think that given all that attention that was on held to maturity, you think they'd ever make that
change of doing it for AOCI but not for held to maturity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That's beyond me. I can't opine on the direction they would go with this. To me, logically, if your view is that you
want to look at long duration risk on the balance sheet and you want to focus in on securities, then you should
probably include everything. But I can't opine on what the regulations will be in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Kevin, you know this, but that's a very surgical way to think about it because nobody is marking the deposit
side on the other side of the ledger. So, when you look at it from an EVE perspective, you could argue that you're
only looking at one component of it, and if you marked the liabilities, you'd be in a very different position.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks very much. Kevin, I was just going to ask you the same point about marking deposits. So, thank you for
covering that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
My other question was on the FHLB increase, was that due to the overall line or did you have to pledge more
collateral this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
That is due to pledging more collateral. As we've always felt comfortable with our liquidity profile and contingent
liquidity sources. But this in the past month, there have been new metrics that people, that the press and analysts
have focused in on, like contingent liquidity relative to uninsured deposits and ratios like that. And so, we spent a
lot of time over the past few weeks looking at our loans that were not pledged anywhere, and we had almost $30
billion of unpledged loans. And so, we spent time looking at those data tapes, sending them to the online banks,
sending them to the Federal Reserve, and increasing our contingent liquidity at those locations. And clearly, that
doesn't cost us anything. It's just an effort of getting loan tapes to those to those places and making that they're
accepted. And so, that was a little bit of work that we went through over the last month. We think that's a prudent
thing to do. We do not intend to use that capacity, but it's there for us in a severe adverse or an unexpected
situation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Jamie, Chris, maybe I thought I heard you say, the draw we took this quarter was done out of an abundance
of caution just to have extra liquidity in case we were to see some outflows and we didn't need extra collateral for
that draw. We had capacity. What Jamie was talking about was the incremental capacity that we added during the
quarter just to have additional contingent funding available if we needed it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No. That all makes sense. And for whatever future episodes occur in the marketplace, you're that much more
prepared. So, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for all the information today. It's very helpful.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Operator: The next question comes from Samuel Varga from UBS. Samuel, your line is open. Please go ahead.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Sam.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I wanted to start just one more question on credit with the shift of the part of the consumer book into held-for-sale,
I wanted to ask specifically just on kind of what the thought process was behind that? And then conversely, I
guess, are you seeing any sort of underlying trends that made you more cautious on that particular book that you
moved?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll start and maybe Jamie can cover the held-for-sale. Sam, this is Bob. From a credit perspective, the
move of – that was a third-party move. And just simplistically stated we built that third-party book during the
excess liquidity period we were in during the pandemic and when we were going the other direction with liquidity.
So, it was viewed as an investment alternative, as a surrogate to the investment portfolio and a good yielding
move for us on – with now taking a whole lot of duration risk and some limited what I would call limited credit risk.
And now we're just kind of exiting that position. And again, I think validating that there wasn't a whole lot of credit
risk there. As we took a $6 million charge to make that transfer. But from the underlying consumer credit quality
and I would include small business loans in that category, Sam, since we do a lot of that through our retail
network, we've seen moderate migration in credit metrics or moderate deterioration. Most of our mortgage
portfolio is private wealth and position. So it's holding up fairly well. We do have an affordable program that we're
actually very proud of that we used to support lower income in LMI districts and we have seen some deterioration
there.
But again, we think we're working with those borrowers, have great programs and assistance programs that we
provide and proud to do that in our markets actually. So, overall credit in the consumer books kind of stable with
some slight deterioration in small business. And Jamie, on the accounting side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we think about that portfolio that the auto portfolio that we moved to held-for-sale, that's something we
began talking about and, I believe, in October after third quarter earnings. And it's a process that we've been
proceeding down and we moved it held-for-sale and then the month of March happened and there's just more
uncertainty out there. And so, it's our intent to sell that portfolio. As Bob mentioned, the credit is performing very
well. They're also shorter duration assets. And so, there are assets that we like. We think there is a good profile,
good risk adjusted return. But given the last month, I would say that it's a little more uncertain out there, the
environment to sell loans like this. But what we will continue to intend to sell it and we'll continually reassess as
we see where the market is on that.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. I appreciate the color. And then if I can just have one more in there. Jamie, I appreciate the color you gave
on the deposit beta assumptions and how those are moving around. I guess what the mix impact on that? Would
you be able to give some specific color on the interest-bearing deposit beta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As you think about interest-bearing deposit beta, we were at 43 in the first quarter and as I mentioned, the month
of March, a little bit higher in interest-bearing deposit cost, I guess due to the cycle interest-bearing deposit cost of
47. It's – the mix is really important when you think about what happens from here as we get later in the cycle. But
we could see that approach 60% as you get out into the third quarter.

Kevin Blair for any closing remarks. Thank you.

Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Adam. And as we wrap up our call today, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of our results to-date
and for the agility we're showing to adapt to an ever changing marketplace while continuing to make progress and
executing on our strategic plan. Our team continues to work tirelessly to deliver the highest quality of service and
advice to our clients while addressing the uncertainty and anxiety caused by a few bank failures that were
idiosyncratic in nature.
Despite these challenges, we delivered strong financial results, we continued to grow our client base. We further
de-risked the balance sheet and we adjusted our forward plans to produce mid to high single-digit PPNR growth
for the year. And we're delivering on these results in the face of either a prolonged economic slowdown or an
actual recession. There are awards and the recognition that we referenced today, coupled with others we did not
mention, such as being recognized as the top workplace in Atlanta, serve as further proof points that our clients
and our team members trust and value our company and the services we provide. And you can rest assure that
we're not satisfied with this recognition, but rather our focus will remain on incremental improvements as well as
investing in our teams and empowering them to deliver the best possible experience to our clients.
We believe that our success is not just measured on financial performance, but also by the impact we have on our
communities. That's why we remain dedicated to supporting the 55 MSAs that we support in our five-state
footprint. As we recently announced our 2023 financial commitment to more than 300 organizations that do
amazing work across our footprint. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize relationship banking, values
