purchase volume, and delivered ending receivables growth of 8% compared to last year. Synchrony's proprietary
data and analytics in combination with our flexible financing solutions and dynamic technology platform have been
core drivers of our performance through evolving market conditions, particularly as we seek to responsibly
address the needs of our customers and partners.
And while our credit trends relative to pre-pandemic levels have outperformed most of the industry today, we have
leveraged these strengths to take action in our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of
default. These credit actions, along with a more selectively spending consumer, have contributed to lower new
account and purchase volume growth in the second quarter, but have also improved our recent delinquency
trends and should strengthen our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2024 and beyond.
At the platform level, purchase volume and receivables trends were generally consistent in the second quarter.
Purchase volume growth ranged from up 2% to down 3% year-over-year, broadly reflecting lower consumer
spend on bigger ticket items, particularly in categories like furniture, jewelry, and vision, as well as the impact of
the credit actions. Meanwhile, receivables growth across the platforms ranged from 6% to 15% higher versus last
year, driven primarily by payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total
purchase volume for the quarter and increased 2%. Synchrony's out-of-partner spend gives us deeper insight into
recent customer trends as the broad utility of our offerings and compelling value propositions attract purchases
across a range of categories, industries, and products.
Our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases, particularly in larger ticket categories
such as home furnishings, travel, and entertainment. They have been spending more at restaurants, though, and
continue to spend at the pharmacy and on health and wellness needs and contributing to non-discretionary spend
growth more broadly. That said, our customers are spending slightly less per transaction across most categories
and credit grades as average transaction values declined about 2% versus last year. Only our top credit segment
saw growth in average ticket values during the second quarter.
Customers across credit grades are transacting more frequently, however, which has generally offset most of the
impact of lower transaction values. Altogether, we view these spend behaviors as appropriate and consistent with
the payment rate normalization that began in our portfolio in 2023 and has continued since.
Over the first six months of 2024, however, the pace of this payment rate moderation has decelerated across
credit grades. And according to the external deposit data we monitor, there continues to be relative stability in
savings balances compared to the rapid tapering that occurred through the middle of last year. When taken
together, we believe these spend, payment, and savings trends support our view that consumers are making
healthy decisions to actively manage their cash flows. And these trends, coupled with the impact of our credit
actions, give us confidence that Synchrony's net charge-off rate should be lower in the second half of this year
than in the first half.
As we continue to monitor the health of the consumer, our portfolio, credit performance, and that of the broader
industry, Synchrony is also utilizing our proprietary insights and lending expertise to position our business for a
sustainable, risk-adjusted growth for many years to come.
During the second quarter, we added or renewed more than 15 partners, including a program expansion and
extension with Verizon and the addition of Virgin Red. We are excited about our continued partnership with
Verizon and the opportunity we see to deliver maximum customer value on purchases made at Verizon.

We are also proud to be the exclusive issuer of Virgin Red's multi-category travel card, the first-ever Virgin Red
Rewards World Elite Mastercard, which will connect members across the Virgin family, from flights to cruises,
hotels and experiences, with points that never expire. Cardholders will earn Virgin Points on all of their Virgin Red
Rewards card spend, which can be used for a range of gifts and rewards, all while enjoying a first-rate digital
experience from application to servicing.
And as Synchrony continues to extend our reach and further optimize outcomes for both our customers and
partners, we are incorporating strategic and technology-oriented partnerships to power more seamless digital
experiences. Synchrony selectively works with second-look financing solutions to enhance the customer
experience and our partner relationships.
We recently announced an expanded relationship that will utilize our fully integrated solution spanning the full
customer applying by experience across all points of sale. Synchrony will own the point-of-sale platform and
connect to the second source provider in a way that's seamless to both the partner and the customer that's
applying. This collaboration will utilize our innovative technology and data to responsibly expand access to credit
to more consumers while also driving stronger loyalty and sales for the many small businesses, healthcare
providers and retail partners we serve.
Meanwhile, Synchrony launched our partnership with Installation Made Easy, a leading enterprise software and
services company that supports retail-based home improvement programs. This partnership will enable Floor &
Decor cardholders to use their Synchrony-issued credit card to finance both the materials and the installation
service required for their home improvement projects through one streamlined process. We're excited about the
opportunity we see to strengthen our position in the home improvement market and plan to scale this capability to
additional retailers over time.
So, whether it's through the continued expansion of our distribution networks, the addition and renewal of
programs that span most consumer spend categories, or the enhanced functionality at point-of-sale, Synchrony is
leveraging our proprietary data and analytics, our diverse product suite, and our innovative technology to drive
greater access, flexibility, and utility for both our customers and partners.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results continue to demonstrate the
resilience of our differentiated business model through an evolving environment. While consumers are managing
their cash flows and consumption and the impact to our credit actions are beginning this season, we remained
focused on driving sustainable, risk-adjusted growth.
Turning to our financial performance. Ending loan receivables grew 7.9% to $102 billion in the second quarter,
benefiting from our approximately 80-basis-point decrease in the payment rate and reflecting growth across each
of our sales platforms.
Net revenue increased 13% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher interest and fees, lower RSA, and an increase in
other income. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.4 billion, as interest and fees grew 10%, primarily reflecting
growth in average loan receivables.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Our loan receivable yield grew 14 basis points, benefiting from product repricing actions and lower payment rate,
partially offset by the higher reversals as our net charge-offs increased. RSAs of $810 million in the second
quarter were 3.21% of average loan receivables, down $77 million versus the prior year, driven by higher net
charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. And the increase in other income primarily reflected a
$51 million gain related to the exchange of our Visa B-1 shares, as well as initial fee-related impact of our product,
pricing and policy changes, or PPPCs. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best
disposition.
Provision for credit losses increased to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $70 million reserve
build. Other expenses grew 1% to $1.2 billion, which was driven by technology investments, preparatory
expenses related to the Late Fee rule change, and servicing costs related to newly acquired businesses, partially
offset by the operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs. The
preparatory expenses related to the Late Fee rule changes reflected $23 million of incremental costs related to
both the execution of our PPPCs and the implementation of the rule itself, should it become effective. Even with
these incremental costs, Synchrony's efficiency ratio was 31.7% for the second quarter, an improvement of
approximately 380 basis points versus last year.
In sum, Synchrony generated net earnings of $643 million or $1.55 per diluted share. This produced a return on
average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.2%.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 9. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47% versus
3.84% in the prior year and 19 basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of 2017 to
2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.19% versus 1.77% last year, and 18 basis points above our historical
average from the second quarters of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge-off rate was 6.42% in the second quarter
compared to 4.75% in the prior year and 62 basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of
2017 to 2019.
Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.74%, up 2 basis points from 10.72% in
the first quarter. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflected loan receivable growth.
As shown on slide 10, the credit actions we've taken thus far are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate
of year-over-year growth continues to decelerate. We'll continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance and
the credit trends for the broader industry, given our shared consumer, and we will take additional credit actions as
necessary. While these actions are reducing new account and purchase volume growth in the short term, we
expect they will strengthen our portfolio's positioning as we exit 2024 and support our ability to deliver our
targeted risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
Turning to slide 11, Synchrony's funding, capital, and liquidity remain a source of strength. We grew our direct
deposits in the quarter as consumers responded to our strong offerings while reducing our brokered deposits.
Deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end, and secured and unsecured debt each represented
8% of total funding. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $23 billion, up $3.6 billion from last year,
and represented 19.1% of total assets, up 124 basis points from last year.
Moving on to our capital ratios, as a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued
by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will make a final transitional adjustment to our regulatory capital
metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in
our income statement and balance sheet.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.6%, 20 basis points lower
than last year's 12.8%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8%, 20 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio
increased 10 basis points to 15.8%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased
to 23.9% compared to 22.8% last year.
During the second quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $300 million of share
repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, we had $1 billion remaining of our
share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025.
Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance,
market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. Combining those results, Synchrony
delivered a second quarter performance largely within our expectations.
We remain focused on taking appropriate actions to prepare our business for years to come, including our ability
to deliver our long-term target loss rates between 5.5% and 6% and average return on assets of at least 2.5% on
average over time. We've been closely monitoring our performance and taking prudent credit actions in support of
these objectives. And in preparation for the pending new rule on late fees and our desire to offset the impact on
our business as soon as possible, Synchrony has completed the first phase of our PPPCs. Most of these actions
will begin to go into effect in the second half of 2024 and we'll continue to track their financial and operational
impact on our customers, partners, and portfolio to determine, alongside our partners, whether any refinements to
our strategies are warranted to achieve our shared objective.
As a reminder, specifically related to the framework around the pending Late Fee rules and our PPPCs, there
continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late fee-related litigation that was filed in March,
the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of Late Fee rule changes, and any
potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the PPPCs we implement as a result of the new rule.
Outcomes and actual performance related to these uncertainties could impact our outlook.
With that framework, let's turn to the outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the consumer to continue to
manage their cash flows and consumption, which, when combined with our credit actions, should result in flat to
low-single digit decline in purchase volume. We continue to expect payment rates to moderate, which, when
combined with our purchase volume expectations, should contribute to more moderate loan receivable growth in
the second half. Excluding the impact of Late Fee rule implementation, we expect net interest income and other
income to progressively grow in the third and fourth quarters as our PPPCs take effect.
From a credit perspective, delinquency should continue to trend in line with or better than seasonality. We expect
our net charge-off rate to be lower in the second half of this year than the first half. Our reserve coverage ratio at
the end of 2024 is expected to be generally in line with our year-end 2023 reserve rate. RSA will continue to align
with program and company performance. And finally, we expect other expenses to trend in line with the first half
average on a dollar basis.
When you combine these factors and include the impact of Late Fee rule, assuming an implementation date of
October 1, 2024, along with the various offsets from the implementation of our PPPCs and the $1.96 per share
gain on the sale of our Pets Best business in 1Q 2024, Synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per
share between $7.60 and $7.80 for the full year. This consolidated and updated EPS range is in the upper end of
our prior guidance and reflects Synchrony's dedication to delivering optimized outcomes for our many
stakeholders, including strong risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.

Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start with just the health of the consumer. It sounds
like the consumer is coming in a little weaker than you had maybe anticipated between purchase volume being
lower, reserve rate a little higher. First, I guess, is that a fair statement? And if so, can you just comment on what
other changes that is driving? Is it signaling that you need to tighten underwriting? Are you continuing to tighten
underwriting? Is that broad-based? Is it about tweaking around the edges? Just how are you thinking of the
consumer heading into, like, back-to-school season here and just trying to understand your view on the
consumer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Yeah, no, thanks for the question. I think – well, generally, I think in the aggregate, the consumer is still in
pretty good shape. I think the trends that we're seeing are pretty similar across the industry. Obviously, labor
market is strong. That's definitely helping. I think most of the indicators so far are largely in line with what we're
expecting to see. With that said, as you kind of dig into the portfolio, there are clearly some differences, as well as
you look at different customer cohorts. The more affluent, higher-income segments are still spending. They're not

really as impacted by inflation. On the other end of the spectrum, you are starting to see the lower-income
consumer pull back a bit. They're rotating into non-discretionary categories.
So, it's clear that they're feeling the effects of inflation, and they're managing to a budget. And so, while you're
seeing that impact, purchase volume [indiscernible] (00:22:22) new accounts, we think that's actually a positive
from a credit perspective. People are being disciplined. That's a good thing. We don't see people overextending.
So, they're managing their spend and their cash flows, which, again, I think is a positive from a credit perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
So, maybe just staying on credit then, just on the reserve rate guidance, it's changed to be – I think now you're
saying year-end 2024 in line with 2023. I think earlier it was a little bit better than 2023. That said, you did call out
– and we see the data, right, the delinquency rate is trending in line or better than seasonality. Were you
expecting more improvements than you've got? I'm just trying to understand the factors driving the higher guide
on reserve rate, and if that implies 2025 net charge-offs will be similar to 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mihir. When we entered the year, I think everyone had a perspective with regard
to how the economy is going to develop, how inflation potentially could bend, and interest rates could move down,
right? As Brian mentioned, the consumer is managing, and the longer they stay in a period of higher costs,
particularly those that are lower income to medium income, that poses different risks. I think as we sit here in the
middle part of the year, we would have hoped for probably greater progression against the inflation, even though
we understood it was sticky, and we'd hoped for – even though we only had three rate increases or rate – I'm
sorry, rate decreases for the back half of the year, we're down to one.
So, I think things have shifted out a little bit. So, I think we're just being a little bit more cautious with regard to how
we think about the macro going forward until we see signs that inflation really is breaking through some of the
stickiness and you see some help to those consumers. So, I don't think it's a tremendously different posture. It's
just a little bit more conservative in how you think about your quantitative reserves versus your qualitative
reserves.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess, based on the rollout of your PPPCs, is the $650 million to $700 million
range still kind of the right range to think about for the second half? And then secondly, is there a way you can
kind of quantify how that range changes if the late fee cap were to not be implemented this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Terry. I'll start where you ended. As we sit here today, there continues to be
activity in the Texas courts. And as Brian indicated and I indicated in our remarks, that is uncertain. So, the best
guess we have now is an October 1 implementation date. And until we get some more definitive view with regard
to whether or not that rule becomes effective on that date or a different date, we don't really have an update with
regard to the impact and its effect if it doesn't go into play. So, again, when we have greater certainty with regard
to that implementation date, we'll most certainly come back.
With regard to the impact of the PPPCs, we provided updated guidance today. Again, if you take the midpoint of
both the core, as well as the late fee assuming October 1 implementation date and add the Pets Best, you're at
the midpoint to high end of the range from an EPS, which should give you a perspective on how we feel about
both the core business, as well as the actions we're taking with regard to the potential change in late fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry Ma Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the RSA, how should we think about how that would trend in the
second half as your kind of [indiscernible] (00:26:21) again start rolling in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. A framework to think about, Terry, is to think about the pieces that are going to flow through here.
Obviously, we indicated that the second half loss rate will be lower than the first half loss rate, so obviously, that's
a upward bias on the RSA percent. Most certainly, I think, in the third quarter, you're going to see some of the
PPPC actions roll through. That's going to create an upward bias in the RSA. And then that turns around in the
fourth quarter, again, assuming an October 1 implementation date of late fees, that comes into place. And then I
think it's just going to track with NII growth, which will be a little bit beneficial with slightly lower purchase volume.
So, there'll be some puts and takes, some of which will create headwinds, some of which will create tailwinds.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Yeah, thanks. Look, I appreciate there's a lot of moving pieces on the NIM for the second half of the year just
given the implementation of some of the PPCs (sic) [PPPCs] (00:27:35) and the potential rolling of the late fee
impact. But could you just, Brian, maybe just give us a sense of kind of what the moving pieces are and what kind
of your expectations are for NIM in the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, here's a framework how I think about some of the moving pieces you got
to take into consideration, right? Number one, as we talked about, net charge-offs being lower in the second half
versus the first half, you'll get a benefit to the net interest margin, right, relative to lower reversals. So, that's a
positive to net interest margin. I think when you look at the net funding costs, so the interest expense and the
investment income, that's probably going to be flattish to the back half of the year. You will pick up and there'll be
a benefit into the net interest margin relative to the mix between average loan receivables and average interest
earning assets. So, that will be a positive to NIM.
You will pick up, and you should see it in the third quarter, some of the PPPC actions that are yield related. So,
again, some of the things that were strictly APR related, some of the practices related, how interest was
assessed, and a little bit related to some promotional fees that roll into place. And you should see, again,
hopefully a little bit benefit on the interest and fee line. So, generally, there should be a positive trend up from
where we move here into the back half of the year.

Okay. That's helpful. And are there any contemplated PPPC measures that you've yet to put in place and are
waiting for either to see how the consumer behaves or for actual implementation of the changes to the Late Fee
rules?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. What our team has gone through – the first wave that we've executed against that are ones that we have
fully vetted internally with ourselves and with our partners. So, they're fully executed. There are other things down
the road that are probably a little bit longer tail that we're still continuing to evaluate some around product
configuration and other types of products for different segments inside the portfolio. So, that's not necessarily [ph]
part of initial sub (00:29:55), but that may be a reaction that we come back with over time, but wasn't necessarily
critical to us to try to achieve the goal of being ROA neutral with the same level of sales.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks. Just continuing on that idea of the pricing changes, I know it's early, but have there been kind of
impacts on the consumer side that you can kind of see or talk about, positive or negative, from the pricing
changes that you've put in place?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thank you, Moshe, for the question. We have a detailed monitoring dashboard that's in place that looks at
a lot of different measures, Moshe. It starts with purchase active rate, sales per account. As you can imagine, it
includes closure rates – voluntary closure rates. It includes call volume, complaint volume, all sorts of different
measures that we would look at relative to this. I think it's important to understand while the first wave is complete
now, from – we only have the CITs that we mailed in December having a full quarter.
When we look at that dashboard in its entirety, it's generally in line with our expectations. As we step into the third
quarter, I think we're going to get a greater view with regard to consumers' adoption with regard to it. And I think
we've seen some positive things around e-bill adoption, et cetera. So, we closely monitor it gets produced and
distributed to a wide variety of people inside the organization as we closely look at that and share that with our
partners.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Got it. Thanks. And, Brian, you talked a little bit about the delinquency and loss rates relative to the 2017 to 2019
averages. Given that you've kind of said and reaffirmed that they will continue to improve and be lower in the
second half and possibly better than seasonals, I guess, how do you see that – assuming employment levels are
stable here, how would you see that kind of trending towards those averages? How close could they get, and
what is it that would then kind of get you to the point where you could think about neutralizing or reversing some
of those tightening efforts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, I think it's important, Moshe, to really take a step back. First of all, we've lagged the industry with regard
to normalization. I think when you look at the amount that we are above our 2017 to 2019 range, I think outside of
maybe one or two-ish, whereas we actually are performing pretty well, being our 30-plus is 19 basis points higher
than the historical average and our 90-plus being 18 basis points higher than historical average.
And then, again, you're right, when you look at the second quarter on a 30-plus basis, we're a couple of basis
points favorable to seasonality and 90-plus, I think we were from a range of 1 to 2 basis points less than. So,

generally in line to slightly better than seasonality. So, I think we look at that – I think we even look at how the
macro environment develops. And again, the consumer's managing today as we start to see relief kind of come to
them, I think we'll reevaluate. I would not have an expectation that we're going to adjust those refinements in the
near term here until we get greater clarity on the environment.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Hey, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe stick with the late fee topic, given the range of things that have been added, APRs, paper statements,
trailing interest and the like, obviously markets have become hopeful that the rule could get delayed or may rule in
favor of the industry. And I'm just curious, in a scenario – in a positive outcome for the industry, when you think
about the range of changes you've made, what changes do you foresee sticking versus others that there's a
potential you may pare back over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. First of all, good morning, Ryan. The first thing I think we have to have certainty, right, relative to whether or
not the Late Fee rule – if it is delayed or ultimately overturned by the courts, whether or not the CFPB would
continue down the path of pursuing some type of limitation on late fee. So, I think you have to have some level of
certainty beyond that.
I think as you think about the pricing changes, first and foremost, we're going to look at consumer behavior and
whether or not consumer behavior changes here and whether or not changes will be warranted. I think when you
step beyond that, there's probably two buckets, Ryan. The first bucket is one that involves our partners and RSAs.
And there, we would go and share the data with our partners and have a discussion with regard to pricing and

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
make some decisions with their input. And then bucket B is things that are inside our brand and control, so you
think about our Synchrony Mastercard, our Home & Auto card, things like that that we would control, but
obviously, we do that. It's fair to say not everything would ever get rolled back. But to be honest with you, Ryan,
we have not spend a lot of time as a team going through this scenario right now. We're really focused on
implementing the PPPCs and following the developments in the court and being prepared, I think, for the outcome
that the Late Fee rule goes into effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And then if you look at how new accounts have progressed, obviously, they're down a decent amount year-
over-year, which makes sense given the discussion regarding tighter underwriting. But as you look ahead, given
the tightness that it doesn't sound like it's going to be rolled back right now. You also have some payment rate
normalization. How do you think about the pace of loan growth over intermediate timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, first, let me just focus for a little bit on new accounts, the 14%. There's probably two big buckets there,
Ryan. The first is, we are seeing – and Brian talked about this with discretionary spend and some of the things
where the consumers' managing their spend levels, we are seeing lower foot traffic and lower retail traffic, both in
a physical footprint as well as in a digital orientation. So, the through-the-door population most certainly is limiting
some of the opportunities to generate new accounts. And then, obviously, you've had a modest impact from credit
actions with regard to doing that. That will impact growth more so in 2025 than it does really in 2024, right?
So, you think about an account build, it probably takes about 12 months or so to kind of get to a average balance
per account that's more mature. So, I think you're at a little bit of pressure here. I do think, given our position with
most of our partners, you would see probably something above GDP level and we'll continue to grow. More
certainly, when you look at the platforms, we're excited about the Health & Wellness growth we continue to
experience, even though there's some pullback there in Cosmetic and LASIK, for example, but that is a strength
for us. We continue to have strength in some of the other platforms like our Home Specialty business and Home
& Auto. So, again, we're not going to necessarily give guidance, but I think there's some positive things inside of
the sales platforms that will hopefully bridge us into a better economic period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I think the other thing I would add, Ryan, the active account growth that we're seeing, we actually probably watch
that even more than new account growth because we've been making big investments in lifecycle marketing and
figuring out across all of our platforms how do you engage that customer in the second and third, fourth purchase.
And so, just seeing that positive inflection year-over-year I think is a positive. And then, look, the consumer is still
in a good spot, but we are seeing lower store traffic and some pullback there. And then, we're obviously
proactively making some credit actions that'll improve the trajectory into next year. So, overall, we feel pretty good
about the trends that we're seeing.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions around credit quality. Brian Wenzel, if
we – I know I've heard you talk about some of the moves you made to sort of refine the underwriting some time
ago. I mean, are the benefits of that in front of us so that we should see some more stepped-up improvement in
that second derivative on delinquency rates? And then, just I'm trying to think through some of the questions that
were asked before, like shouldn't that really – that coupled with the tighter underwriting and the slower loan
growth should help credit quality, shouldn't it? So, I mean, is that just built-in conservatism in your credit outlook or
what for this year in terms of the flat reserve rate? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. First of all, good morning, Sanjay, and thanks for the question. I think there's a combination where the
credit actions – remember, we started this in the second quarter last year into third and then really started in,
again, the latter part of the first quarter into the second quarter of this year, you see reflecting in the moderation of
the year-over-year change in delinquencies, which we showed on page 10 of the earnings presentation here. So,
some of it is being manifested itself in delinquency trends.
Obviously, it takes time to season, so I think you would expect the benefit of those actions to kind of continue to
go through. Now, again, actions that we've put in place in the second quarter of this year have probably a little bit
more reduced effect on this year, more effect as you exit out of 2024 into 2025. So, it's really a combination.
I'd say from a efficacy standpoint, we are not taking – or not continuing to take broad based actions at this point.
We stand ready to do that if something deteriorates, but right now, we're continuing with our normal refinements,
which are more idiosyncratic at the partner, portfolio, product, and channel level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I have a question for Brian Doubles, follow-up. Maybe you could just talk about the state of potential
partnership opportunities or deals or portfolios, has anything changed relative to the previous quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. Look, I would say that we have a pretty healthy pipeline of opportunities, that continues to be
true. I think competitively, we're certainly differentiated in terms of our technology investments, how we partner,

how we integrate. And so, that continues to resonate with both our existing partners, but also new prospects. So, I
feel really good about all of that.
I think, look, in this environment, too, whenever you're in an environment that's a little bit uncertain, you tend to
see more rational pricing, a little more discipline across the industry, which, again, is a good thing. When we were
in the headier days of 2021, 2022, things could get a little bit irrational when you're pricing at historically low loss
rates. We always price through a cycle. We'll continue to do that. But I think the environment right now across the
industry, across the competitive set is pretty rational. So, I feel really good about how we're positioned, and we've
got a good pipeline of opportunities.

Hey, Rick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Look, I'd love to talk a little bit, you've moved guidance to sort of the upper end of your prior range, and I'm
curious how much of that is a function of timing, favorable timing with PPPC implementation versus late fee, how
much is a function potentially of slower loan growth into the second half of the year and a favorable impact on
reserves and whatever other fundamental factors might be driving that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks for the question, Rick. From a timing perspective, I don't believe that there's anything significant in
the timing of the execution. I'd say, from an execution standpoint, I think we've hit all our deliverables given the
process you have to go through to do the amount of changes in terms that we've done. We've executed on the
timeframe – in the timeframes that we have in place and they're rolling out according to schedule. So, there's
nothing really timing-related there.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
I'd sit back and say, moving to the middle end of the range to the higher end of the range, just really overall
business performance, I think we – while purchase volume might be slightly lower than expectations, it shows the
consumer is managing. We don't see them going under stress. So, I think as we look through the various
elements, our funding costs have stabilized, and stabilized and moving into the back half of the year. I think the
expenses, which we haven't really talked about, only being up 1%, including the cost of $23 million related to the
execution of change in terms, otherwise would have been down, I think, is a positive as we move forward.
So, I think we're continuing to execute the business. The business is really focused on what we have to do this
year in order to execute both on the core business, the reaction to or the PPPC changes that we're rolling out, as
well as the integration of Ally Lending, which we're very happy about and the disposition of Pets Best. So, the
team is focused on execution. That's what I would say drove us to the mid-to-higher end of the range.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about capital. So, in contrast to many banks that are still
dealing with large AOCI marks, you guys appear to have greater clarity on the level of capital that you're going to
need to run with. And therefore, it seemed like you may be in a better position to perhaps return the capital in
excess of your target a little bit more aggressively relative to those who are still accreting capital to sort of plug
that OCI hole. Can you speak to that dynamic and how we should think about, like, the trajectory of that excess
capital position relative to the 11% target you've talked about historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Bill, for the question. We've been on a journey – you've heard me talk about this a number of
times. When we separated from our former parent, we started out and got to a peak of CET1 of 18%, and then
there's been a journey down, where today we're at 12.6%. We have an excess relative to the target. We're
continuing on the path, right? But our first priority is always going to be organic RWA growth, our second is going
to be the dividend, and the third will be what we do with share repurchases or inorganic. And Brian talks about the
discipline we have around inorganic growth. So, we have the ability to do that. I think we're going to be prudent
with regard to the way in which we return back to shareholders. We're not going to just drop it tomorrow because,
obviously, we have many stakeholders here who would not necessarily agree with that action, but we are on
trajectory and moving towards our target, which is always been our long-term goal.

Thanks, Brian. That's helpful. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, your expectation of stable reserve rate at the end
of 2024 versus 2023. It seems like your expectation of a more favorable loss trajectory in your reasonable and
supportable forecast period under CECL would be supportive of reserve releases, all else equal. So, is the
takeaway that your outlook is essentially de-risked and now embeds greater conservatism? Just trying to get a
sense for when you'd feel comfortable getting that reserve rate back to the day one level and whether we should
be thinking of that more as a 2025 event.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Most certainly, it's not going to be a 2024 event, right? As we said, it's flattish to last year. It really goes
back to when do we have greater clarity across – across the industry, everyone [ph] has greater (00:47:41) clarity
with regard to the macroeconomic, when are we going to get back to a more normalized interest rate
environment, more normalized inflation environment, which makes the everyday cost for our consumers – a
shared consumer across the industry much more manageable. It's that uncertainty that, I think, will give people
pause in how they run the different scenarios and have their qualitative assessments. That's probably the largest
wild card. Obviously, you're going to have to watch how your portfolio delinquencies develop and mix, but it's
really getting clarity on that environment. So, again, I think being prudent now is a better course.

have one or two partners where we've largely agreed on what we would do, but we are waiting for the rule to be

effective. Again, that doesn't change our view that we will fully offset this. We will get back to pre-late fee ROAs,
and we'll still support the customers and underwrite the customers that we do today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
The only thing I'd add, Dave, is there is a tail, right, with regard to this, right, because accounts that we originated
in the back half of last year, we wouldn't give them a change in term six months after we just originated – or three
months after we originated the account. So, there will be a tail that goes on here for a long period of time, as well
as the number of inactive accounts that become active. Once they become active, they'll get a CIT. So, it takes a
long time to get to 100% under any scenario, but this will go on and that's part of normal course. And any time we
do a CIT, that is kind of regular course of action.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate that. And then to follow up on Ryan's question from earlier in the
scenario where the Late Fee rule is shot down regarding the changes that stick. I know you haven't given this a
ton of thought yet and that's understandable, but just based on your early assessment of consumer reaction so far
and your dialog with your partners and the fact that there is a good amount of expense associated with
implementing those changes, is there any reason you've seen so far to indicate you would want to unwind the
APR changes or would those be the easiest changes to leave in place? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Look, I think like Brian said earlier, this will be a discussion with the partners. We'll look at for the portion of the
book that we control, we'll look at consumer behavioral changes. It's still really early. These CITs are now just
working their way through the statements and we're just starting to see the customer behavioral changes, which
at this point are very slight, but we need to continue to monitor that. As Brian said, we're all over it and we'll adjust
along the way if we feel like we need to, but we're not preparing for a scenario where the rule doesn't go into
effect. I think we have to control what we control and we control the pricing and policy changes and that's what –
that's what we've done and we're obviously – we think we've got a great case in terms of litigating the rule, but it's
uncertain, so we've got to focus on what we can control.

Morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Actually, I think all of my questions have been answered – or
asked and answered, but I guess I have one incremental one is, you did renew Verizon in the quarter and then
you added Virgin. I am wondering, given I guess the overhang and uncertainty around the late fee situation, how
– have there been any kind of structural changes in how you negotiate these new contracts with that uncertainty
in the background?

strong loyal customer base, so we could not be more excited to partner with Virgin Red on this new product.
Equally as excited to renew Verizon. It's been a strong program for us, great relationship. And so, we're really
excited about that as well.
Certainly, the late fee issue has crept its way into negotiations, new business, renewals unsurprisingly, but there
are ways to structure around this. So, we have certainly contemplated an $8 late fee in every program that we've
renewed since the rule was published, as well as anything that we've extended.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The only thing I'd add, John, is in that structuring of pricing, we assume late fees going at $8. To the extent
that there is upside – we're protected at the downside. There may be things that you do on the upside relative to
partners, particularly even when you look at the portfolio required in the second quarter from another issuer, we're
relatively protected or are protected relative to the $8 late fee going into place. It's just we're more conservative in
pricing. We think it's going to – as much as we like the chances that the industry has against the rule, we're not
going to bank on it and are pricing a deal that lasts 7 to 10 years.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the 2023 vintage, just how that's performing? You've got another quarter under
your belt relative to your expectations and maybe 2022, and I know you haven't had as much [indiscernible]
(00:54:19) volatility versus general purpose.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Don. So, again, I think, level setting – first of all, I'd like to do it against the
industry. I think if you go and look to some of the credit bureaus and you look at the industry vintage curves, our
relative portfolios are performing better than the industry's curves, both from delinquency and cumulative net
charge-off perspective. That being said, we've talked extensively over time that there is a shared consumer. We
do feel the effects of what other issuers did as they exited the pandemic adjusting some of their credit criteria or
according to credit box in their world and issued an awful lot of – some of the biggest vintages we've ever seen in
the credit card industry. So, I use that as a background.
I think when you look at delinquencies, and I'll give you some of the details here, Don, when you look at
delinquencies, the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2023 are performing slightly worse than or worse
than 2018 vintage. 2019 gets skewed because you have the year of the pandemic. The second half 2023, and
what we see, and again, it is very early, but when you look at the early indications off of 2024, because of the
credit actions we've taken, they are performing better than the first half of 2023.
And when you think about a charge-off perspective, the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024 are
performing better than 2018. So, I do think some of the modifications that we've made in credit actions are
supporting the vintages. We have some of the shared consumer in that 2021 into partially into – the back half of
2021 into early part of 2023 that has given us a little bit of the trends above our historical delinquency rate, but
again, we feel good about how the vintages are developing.
