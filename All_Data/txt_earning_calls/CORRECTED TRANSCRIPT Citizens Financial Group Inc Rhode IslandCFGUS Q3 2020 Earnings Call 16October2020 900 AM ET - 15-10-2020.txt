Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We feel really positive about how Citizens
continues to rise for the occasion and meet the unprecedented challenges of 2020. We're taking great care of
customers, colleagues, and communities while posting strong results that demonstrate the diversification and
resilience of our business model. We are delivering record levels of pre-provision profit and we're managing risks
on our balance sheet well in the near term while also preserving and making the strategic investments to position
us for growth and success in the long term.
Financial performance in Q3 featured record revenue, fee income and mortgage results. The low rate and flat
yield curve environment puts pressure on NIM, but our well-positioned mortgage business has performed

exceptionally well capturing the refi opportunity, gaining market share and providing a natural offset to low rates.
We included a page on this business in our investor deck. In short, we believe the mortgage business has room to
run given a positive market environment plus our own strong positioning and capabilities.
In addition to mortgage, we saw a solid quarter in capital markets revenue given strong advisory and underwriting
performance, and a nice rebound in wealth fees. Consumer fees also continue to move higher off of the COVID-
related lockdown lows, which should continue as the economy further reopens and consumer behavior
normalizes.
These factors drove non-interest income growth of 11% sequential quarter and 33% year-on-year. Combined with
a modest decline in NII and broadly stable expenses, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 2.6%
sequential quarter and 9% year-on-year. Our pre-provision net revenue grew by 22% year-on-year and it's up
14% on a year-to-date basis.
Now, this capital generation ranks near the top of peers and has allowed us to grow loans to support customers
build a prudent level of credit reserves given the uncertainty of the environment, maintain an attractive dividend
payout while delivering a 9.8% CET1 ratio, which is within our targeted range of 9.75% to 10%. This capital and
reserve strength gives us tremendous financial flexibility going forward from a strategic and an operational
perspective.
Our view on the economy continues to be cautiously optimistic. Our consumer credit book is tracking favorable to
expectations, given past stimulus, economic reopening and forbearance. On the commercial side, we are seeing
some selective credit stress in industry segments that are most impacted by COVID-19 and the lockdowns. We
took sizable charge-offs on two credits during the quarter as loss recognition can be a little lumpy.
That said, we feel we are near peak charge-offs in commercial, assuming the macro environment stays on the
current trajectory. Our work on TOP and BSO continues to make solid progress. We are adding material work
streams to TOP 6 largely centered on digitization and we will provide a full expense guide on our year-end call.
On BSO, we completed a student loan sale as we develop an originate-to-distribute model and we executed an
attractive sub debt exchange that delivered both financial and regulatory capital benefits. It's been quite a
remarkable year and we feel we've handled the challenges well and we're poised for success as the economy
recovers.
With that, let me turn it over to John for a thorough review of our financials, John?

Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter
starting on page 5. This was an outstanding quarter for Citizens despite the ongoing challenges in the operating
environment. We have generated record revenue and PPNR in last two quarters with an excellent balance sheet
position at September 30.
For the third quarter, we reported underlying net income of $338 million, EPS of $0.73 and record revenue of $1.8
billion. Our underlying ROTCE was 9%. PPNR increased 6% linked quarter to another record level and was up
22% year-over-year. We posted record fee income for the quarter, faced by record mortgage fees and strong
results in capital markets and wealth. Also, we delivered positive operating leverage of 2.6% linked quarter and
9% year-over-year, as we continued our strong expense discipline.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Net interest income was down 2% linked quarter due to a 3% decline in loans, given line draw pay downs and a 5
basis point reduction in NIM due to rates and elevated cash. This was mitigated by excellent results in interest-
bearing deposit costs, which fell 13 basis points linked quarter to 35 basis points. I should note that on a
normalized basis, which adjusts for PPP loans, commercial line repayments and the education loan sale
completed in the quarter, average loans were up slightly linked quarter.
We increased our allowance for credit losses to $2.7 billion, which translates to a prudent ACL coverage ratio of
2.29% excluding PPP loans, up from 2.09% last quarter. Note that the reserve build during the quarter of $209
million impacted EPS by $0.40 and ROTCE by 5 percentage points. We believe charge-offs should be stable in
Q4, and barring a deterioration in economic outlook, we should start to see reserve releases beginning in the
fourth quarter.
Even with a significant reserve build, we demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength, ending the quarter with a
CET1 ratio of 9.8%, up 20 basis points linked quarter and back within our pre-COVID operating level of
approximately 9.75% to 10%. And liquidity ratios also improved as we ended the quarter with an LDR of 87%, and
we remain in compliance with the LCR. Our tangible book value per share is $32.24 at quarter end, up 2%
compared with a year ago.
On page 6, I'll cover net interest income. Net interest income was down 2% linked quarter given the impact of
lower rates and a 3% decrease in loans as line draws were repaid, partly offset by lower interest-bearing deposit
costs and improved deposit mix.
Despite the challenging rate environment, net interest margin held up well, down 5 basis points this quarter. Rates
drove a 7 basis point decrease through lower asset yields and higher cash balances were a 2 basis point impact.
These were partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposit costs and outsized growth in DDA.
Moving to page 7, we delivered record results again this quarter in fees reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in
and diversify our revenue streams. Underlying non-interest income was up 11% linked quarter and 33% year-
over-year as our fee income ratio improved to 37%.
Mortgage banking delivered record results again this quarter on continued strength in originations, more than
offsetting the modest decline in margins compared to last quarter's all-time high. The mortgage business
continues to provide an excellent natural hedge as intended against low rate pressure on NII.
The wealth business rebounded nicely in the quarter with revenues rebounding to record levels. This was driven
by a strong increase in transaction volume and a solid increase in AUM. Service charges and card fees continue
to trend back to pre-COVID levels. Key consumer drivers were increases in credit card purchase volume and
debit card transaction volume, each of which is nearing pre-COVID activity levels.
Capital market fees were down linked quarter driven primarily by a recovery in trading values in the prior quarter.
Excluding this, capital market fees were up 11%, driven by accelerating activity in loan syndications and M&A
advisory.
Turning to page 8, let's take a closer look at the mortgage business. The strong performance of the mortgage
business again this quarter has really boosted our overall performance, providing diversification in this low-rate
environment. The business continues to demonstrate the benefits of the scale and diversity of our origination
channels off the back of our 2018 acquisition of Franklin American. We have made significant investments in the
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
business over the last few years, upgrading our customer-facing technology with our focus on innovating the
customer experience. Over 60% of retail applications are now completed through our digital app.
The strength of our multi-channel distribution capabilities has enabled us to meet the extraordinary increase in
demand in the market, with 2020, the largest year for mortgage originations in US history. We expect volumes to
remain elevated through 2021 at today's rates. And we expect to make market share gains even as rates rise as
we transition to a more purchase-driven market given our strength and execution consistency and leveraging our
scale and channel diversification across our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels.
Turning to page 9 on expenses, underlying non-interest expense was down slightly linked quarter, reflecting
continued strong expense discipline that generated robust positive operating leverage in the quarter. This
continued expense discipline has contributed to the year-over-year and linked quarter improvement in the
efficiency ratio, now at 53%. Salaries and employee benefits were relatively stable linked quarter and up 3% year-
over-year due to expenses connected to strong mortgage banking production volumes.
Next on page 10, average core loans were down 3% linked quarter and up slightly after normalizing for the impact
of PPP loans, commercial line repayments, and loan sales. We saw growth in consumer lending in both mortgage
and student.
Moving to page 11, average deposits were broadly stable linked quarter and up 14% year-over-year as
consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and clients build liquidity. We were
especially pleased with our progress on deposit costs which [ph] went (00:12:18) 29% or 10 basis points to 25
basis points during the quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 13 basis points to 35 basis points.
We executed our deposit playbook to manage down deposit costs across all channels while improving our overall
funding mix. We brought interest-bearing deposit costs down significantly by leveraging data and analytics to
personalize offers and optimize pricing for our affluent and mass affluent customers. We continue to see a shift
towards lower-cost categories with average DDA growth of 8% on a linked quarter basis and 40% year-over-year.
This continues the peer-leading momentum we have demonstrated in growing low-cost deposits over the last
three years.
Turning to page 12 to discuss our CECL methodology and reserves. We have summarized the key aspects of our
macroeconomic scenario, which is a foundational element of the CECL reserve estimate. This scenario has
improved slightly on that used in Q2. Nonetheless, we use management overlays and qualitative factors to build
reserves, focusing on expected performance trends in specific commercial sector portfolios most impacted by
COVID-related lockdowns, namely retail and hospitality-related CRE, and casual dining, as well as in selected
retail products. We feel we are well reserved at this point for extended pandemic and lockdown impacts from
these sectors. Notwithstanding the sizable reserve build, our CET1 ratio improved 20 basis points to 9.8% given
our robust PPNR growth and lower RWAs.
On page 13, we provide detail on our customer forbearance programs. In commercial, loans with payment
deferrals declined to 1.4% of our commercial loan book, down from 5.2% at June 30, and this is further decreased
to 1.2% as of October 13. For retail, loans in forbearance have declined to 3.8% compared to 6% at June 30 and
have further declined to 3.4% as of October 13.
This would be approximately 2% if we reported forbearance ending immediately after the last deferred payment.
The performance of customers that have exited forbearance is trending well with approximately 95% in current
status. Also, for customers that have not taken any forbearance, the delinquency status is trending favorably.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Deferrals in business banking were 8.1% and are expected to decrease to approximately 1% by the end of
October with about 40% of our customers having received PPP funds and reopenings alleviating some of the
stress.
Turning to page 14 on credit, non-accrual loans increased 29% linked quarter given a $254 million increase in
commercial, which was driven by two credits to mall REITs impacted by COVID-related lockdowns and as well as
a $33 million increase in retail. Note that our total mall REIT exposure is approximately $400 million with two
credits now in NPA status and the other performing okay.
Net charge-offs were 70 basis points this quarter driven by two large credits in commercial, one to a mall REIT
and one in metals and mining. The increase in commercial was partially offset by an improvement in retail,
reflecting the impact of forbearance and the improving economic backdrop in Q3. We took a prudent $209 million
reserve build this quarter which increased our coverage ratio from 2.09% in 2Q to 2.29% in the 3Q excluding PPP
loans. Despite the somewhat lumpy increase in NPAs and charge-offs during the quarter, we're seeing broad
signs of progress in commercial credit quality as the economy recovers.
In the appendix, on page 23, we provide you with an update on our view of the commercial portfolio. In the
commercial portfolio, as businesses have reopened and liquidity has improved from capital raising and federal
stimulus, we have seen sectors begin to stabilize. These include accommodation and food services credits,
including quick service food concepts that have performed well during the pandemic, the retail trade sector getting
our portfolio of lower risk gas stations and essential services, the less price-sensitive credits and the energy and
related sector, and finally the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector as sports teams and stadiums that have
further benefited from professional sports resuming.
Given these positive trends, the areas we consider to be of elevated concern have dropped from 10% in 2Q to
approximately 5% of total loans. The remaining areas of concern have been particularly hit by COVID-related
closures mainly across retail-related CRE and hospitality, casual dining, retail trade, educational services, and
price-sensitive energy.
On page 15, as I mentioned earlier, we feel well positioned to manage through the current environment with
strong capital and liquidity positions. Our CET1 ratio improved to 9.8%, up 20 basis points linked quarter given
our strong PPNR generation and reduction in risk-weighted assets. We are now back in our target range of 9.75%
to 10%.
PPNR as a percentage of average assets was 3.9% year-to-date on a nine-quarter DFAST calculation basis and
has increased steadily over the last five years, reflecting the benefits of investments and increasingly diversified
revenue base. Strong deposit growth outpaced loan growth, which improved our liquidity metrics and drove the
spot LDR down to 87%. During third quarter 2020, the company completed a subordinated debt exchange that
will benefit total capital going forward by increasing the percentage of qualifying Tier 2 debt.
Turning to page 16, I'll update you on TOP 6. We continue to execute on the transformational and traditional TOP
program, and they've clearly been instrumental in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage and drive
ROTCE improvement. The initiatives we launched are expected to achieve the original 2020 pre-tax run rate
target of $225 million and we are still on track to hit the $300 million to $325 million by year-end 2021.
We are also adding significant work streams to TOP 6, largely focused on accelerating our digital capabilities to
create increased efficiencies and frictionless customer experiences. These should deliver at least $100 million run
rate by the end of 2021 and we are working to increase this, though we are also working through the cost impact

of how much we'll invest or reinvest in strategic initiatives to drive future growth. We will be updating our expense
outlook including the benefit of the expanded initiatives to upscale these programs as part of our 4Q earnings call
in January.
On pages 17 and 18, I want to highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company. As we
continue to strategically invest through the crisis to position us well for the medium term, we are focused not only
on digitization, but also initiatives that position the franchise well for the long term. On the consumer side, we are
focused on national expansion with Citizens Access integrating some of our lending businesses to further develop
our national value proposition.
In merchant finance, we are continuing to add new merchants to our point-of-sale platform, launching five
important new merchant finance partners with more in the pipeline. And we are piloting a new customer-led point-
of-sale value proposition. In commercial, we continue to expand our capital and global markets capabilities,
including completing our first lead-left, high-yield fixed income issuance, and we are also seeing increased client
adoption of our digital treasury solutions.
Now, let's move to page 19 for high level commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be
broadly stable with no expectation of PPP forgiveness benefit until next year. NIM is expected to be down low- to
mid-single digit. Loans should be stable, securities up modestly. Fee income is expected to be down mid-teens
after a record third quarter level reflecting lower mortgage banking fees. While we expect to see mortgage results
come down from 3Q record levels, we do see a significant feeing opportunity that should continue into 4Q and
well into 2021 at attractive margins, albeit lower than recent historic highs.
Non-interest expense is expected to be up modestly reflecting seasonal factors, and we're on track for a full-year
operating leverage of around 4%. We expect relatively stable net charge-offs in the range of 60 to 80 basis points
of average loans. We also expect a reserve release in Q4 given reserve builds taken year-to-date, and we should
see a decline in NPAs.
On slide 20, to sum up, we continue to navigate successfully through the COVID-19 crisis. The resilience of the
franchise is again on display with record PPNR, record fee income and positive operating leverage. We remain
well positioned to continue to strategically invest and deliver on key initiatives. Our ability to execute well drives
our strong profitability, capital and liquidity positions.
With that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.

Securities. Please go ahead.

Hey, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I was just curious what gives you the confidence that non-performing assets are going to decline. And at this point
in the cycle, there still seems a lot of uncertainty that you'd be willing to release reserves next quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Why don't I start, John, and then you could pick in? So if you look at what drove up the NPAs this quarter, it
really was isolated to just two exposures we had to mall REITs, which frankly had been really stellar performing
companies, best in class, which we've had long relationships with. But obviously, the COVID and lockdowns and
changed behavior caused some stress there. And so we've recognized that. We do a pretty careful job of
forecasting migration through criticized assets and what could go NPA. And so we think beyond that we don't
really – as I think John said in his prepared remarks, we're seeing some broad signs of optimism and some
improvement in the overall commercial book.
So we really don't think we're going to be taking a lot new in and then we'll have some charge-offs – some degree
of charge-offs which will reduce the NPA. So you put that all together and I think we're feeling pretty confident on
the commercial side. And then if you look at consumer as well, we've had really, really healthy trends even
surprising to the point of being surprising, but very solid in terms of delinquencies. So we feel really good there as
well.
John, do you want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I'd just add just higher level. We have pretty good line of sight when you think about over the next
60 to 90 days about what's going to migrate on the commercial side. I mean we've got pay downs and charge-offs
that are coming through. Things are – as we mentioned in our overall areas of market concern, we were at 10%
last quarter. That number has fallen to 5%. We delineated where the puts and takes are with respect to that in our
slide deck. And so we've done a bottoms-up cash burn analysis which, Don can comment on. So we feel
reasonably comfortable with that guide on the nonaccruals basis.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And just on the reserve levels with releasing reserves, just I feel like there's still enough uncertainty in the
economy. Just what gives you [indiscernible] (00:25:11) decision to release – possibly release reserves next
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean I'll go ahead and take that one. I think this comes back to the methodology of CECL in the first
place. I mean we've been – over time, there's been significant uncertainty with respect to the scenario and you
saw how that trajectory played out over the first and second quarter where we built in both quarters. This quarter,
the scenario actually got a little better. And I think at least from what we can see, the level of uncertainty has
started to shape into something that we feel comfortable with our outlook. I think the difference this quarter in
terms of our build is we've been spending a lot of time with individual sector reviews and that really was those
management overlays and the qualitative factors are what drove our build this quarter.
After we've gotten through all of that, when we – if the scenario barring a deterioration in the environment, we feel
like after analyzing what we expect the loss content to be in these categories that the reserving requirements
have been satisfied. And so therefore, the loss content has been provided for. And therefore, on a go-forward
basis, the way CECL works is that you would charge off against the reserves that you've already built and the
provisions would be driven by your origination and go-forward activities. So from our standpoint, that would mean
reserve releases with provisions less than charge-offs.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
As we take a step back, obviously unfortunately given the timing of where we are in the year, I'm sure you'll get a
lot of questions on 2021, and I know you'll defer us to January for details. But as we take a step back and we think
about all the work that you've done either through the TOP program and building your fee income-generating
capabilities and weigh that against, obviously, the interest rate challenges and the swap income roll-off, as we
think about normalized return sort of post the spike in credit that we all expect for 2021, as I think about
normalized ROTCE for Citizens sort of in a post-COVID recovery world with no help with rates, do you think that
you have enough in the tail with TOP or fee generation to achieve like a 10% or low-double-digit ROTCE on the
other side?
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start, then again, John, you can add your perspective. But yeah, I think that's certainly the case, Erika.
So if you look at what we deliver just this quarter was 9% with a huge reserve build, which the build basically cost
us 5% of ROTCE. So you can do the math on that. But we'll, I think, going forward have lower credit costs. We'll
have some NIM headwinds, but again, we consider hedges as part of the strategy in managing a low rate
environment. But our mortgage business was also part of that strategy as well. And so there seems to be a great
fixation on hedging and some folks have put hedges on – I think we've done a nice job there, but some folks may
have some longer duration or more hedges, but they don't have the sized mortgage business that we have.
And so I think if you look at our PPNR generation through this year, we're really top of the class in terms of how
we've been performing. So we expect there to be linked to run in the mortgage business through next year. 60%
of the households in the country would benefit, I'd say, by more than 50 basis points in terms of the math if they
refinance their mortgage. So there's going to be continued demand on the refi side. As the market goes back to a
purchase market, we also are very well positioned. We probably have the most diversified origination channels of
any bank-owned mortgage company with exposure to retail to correspondent and wholesale.
We've worked really hard to digitize that business and gain market share and be able to handle volumes
efficiently. So, I feel really good about that. So I'd say we're kind of on the doorstep of crashing through double-
digit ROTCE. I think we can get there and certainly sustain it. But it's going to take all the levers of the fee
investments that we've made, doing more TOP and continuing to focus on driving efficiencies, looking for volume
in terms of loan growth. And we see – we think there's going to be some opportunities. We think we uniquely have
some niches on the consumer side that some of our peers don't have. And I think also in commercial we've been
able to achieve nice growth through the build out of some of our regional geographies. So we know what we have
to do, we know what the objective is and we're going to keep driving towards that original medium term targets. I
think you probably need a little help from rates to get all the way there, but certainly double digit seems like a bar
we can hurdle. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think I've not too much to add other than I think that we have been a self-help story in the past and I think
we absolutely remain so going forward. In the NII space, our BSO actions, and with interest-bearing deposit costs
at around 35 basis points, there's a lot of opportunity there for us. We are a completely different bank than we –
this [ph] SERP (00:31:19) versus last. And so you can expect that our interest-bearing deposit costs are going to
find new lows for the bank compared to what we were at the end of the last [ph] SERP (00:31:29).

On fees, it's night and day with respect to our diversification. A combination of the organic investments that we've
made and the inorganic acquisitions that we've made have been extremely powerful in the fee generation space,
as you're seeing in mortgage. But we shouldn't forget about wealth, which is hovering around record levels on its
own, but sometimes gets overshadowed by the eye popping numbers in mortgage, but the diversification there is
great and the capital markets business has never been more diversified.
And then finally expenses, we've had a history of our TOP 6 programs that will continue. That will be a hallmark of
what we do and we have a lot more opportunity there as well. So those are the final points I'd make.

Hey, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I just wanted to ask on credit broadly. What is your sense for when loss content will really begin to materialize? I
think it kind of feels like it keeps getting pushed back and the consensus now seems to be sort of mid to even late
2021, so just curious to hear your thoughts.
And then just at a very top level, what kind of cycle do you really think you're sort of setting yourselves up for? It
seems like with current info, most of the economy will sort of slog through and it's just these isolated areas that
will see the real pain. So is this something where we could really resolve most of the credit cycle next year or do
we see this sort of bleeding on for a couple of years from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. So what I'd say on that is you have to look at commercial and you have to look at consumer. Consumer has
been extremely well behaved and we've had folks on forbearance. The people rolling off forbearance have
actually been current and we haven't seen any uptick in charge-offs, but I think the residual folks who are on
forbearance, there will be some charge-off content there. And I think that probably doesn't peak until sometime in
the middle of next year, so whether that's Q2 or Q3, we'll see.
I think on the commercial side, we've got hit with two one-offs this quarter. And there's – the pig is going through
the python. I don't think there's significant jumps on the commercial side. I think we're probably nearing the peak
charge-offs, but they'll stay elevated for a while before they move back down, I think, in the second half of the
12

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
year. So I'd say our outlook is that most of this should resolve over the course of next year setting us up for, I
think, more normalized charge-off rates as we head towards 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Any comments? Brendan, you want to comment on the consumer side at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, let me just add a little specificity. So John quoted a few numbers in forbearance, we're increasingly
confident that that portfolio is of high quality particularly with some portfolios that were of high interest that hadn't
gone through a cycle before. Our student portfolio is holding up incredibly well so far. And the merchant finance
portfolio is equally holding up incredibly well. And in fact that portfolio has almost no customers in forbearance at
all. And delinquency is still flat for pre-COVID.
So we're feeling really, really strong about consumer. As John mentioned, the customers that are firmly still in
forbearance has moved from a peak of ever forbearance at 8% to now 2%. And our delinquency rates have been
flat to down at the same time. So we're seeing a lot of gearing out of the forbearance portfolio with very minimal
impact to distressed consumer behavior so far. So we're out of the woods, but surprising – yeah, but on the green
– the green shoots that we're seeing are quite positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And Don, maybe you want to talk about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'd echo that and I do think it's kind of elevated for next year, but we're kind of peeking out where we are
right now. I think, remember, and I'll just emphasize what Bruce said, our view is based on a client-by-client
liquidity analysis where we project out current rates of cash generation versus current rates of cash burn, and
we're seeing really positive trends. We've taken 25% of the companies that were in the high risk category out of
that category based on our last analysis. We're also seeing record level of customer deposits. So they have heavy
levels of liquidity sitting with us. And we're seeing – on a customer-by-customer basis, we're seeing the bigger
customers, as everybody knows, going to the public markets and grabbing any amount of liquidity they can get in
the high yield in the equity markets.
And the smaller customers, while they're having a little bit of a more difficult time, they're managing their
businesses in a really conservative way for cash. So they've kind of cut expense levels and they're positioning
their businesses to survive an extended slowdown if there is an extended slowdown. So we feel good about what
customers are doing on an individual basis.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's perfect color. Thank you very much. And I guess...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...I sneak one in here. Just, Bruce, you noted the kind of emerging emphasis on things like hedging programs,
which you guys have benefited from. I've noticed the same thing. I guess maybe, John, as you sort of think about
things into next year, when and how do we see some of those hedges that you guys put in place roll off and sort
of what is the sense? Should we just sort of recast our focus onto the fee drivers such as mortgage and wealth
that you alluded to earlier or how do we kind of replace those benefits as they do roll off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean basically the hedges that are in place roll off throughout 2021. By the end of 2021, most of that
benefit is starting to wane. But what I do is take a step back on NIM overall. The levers that we're pulling and have
very large opportunity to get after as what I mentioned earlier with respect to interest-bearing deposit costs sitting
at 35 basis points, we expect those to decline significantly in 2021. That's on the sort of funding side of things. We
also are focusing on the asset side. So we have broader BSO efforts, rotating our capital and allocating it into
better risk/return categories and profiles.
And then you've heard from Bruce earlier, the mortgage business has room to run. There are trillions of dollars of
mortgages that have a refinance incentive. And I think that I would say that we have – that business is rate
sensitive and has been part of our hedging story and has done incredibly well. And a lot of – at the NIM
headwinds, frankly, I guess I could say most of the headwinds, all of it in 2020 and probably on a cumulative basis
through 2021, most of those rate headwinds will be offset by expected mortgage fee – elevated mortgage fee
revenues. So – and then, of course, you heard, when you have rates falling, that's a big impact. And we'll have to
look at all the levers across the self-help that we feel like is alive and well here. And that would include expenses
and TOP 6 is part of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, the last thing I would say, Scott, and I know hope is not a strategy, but if you consider that we could see
real progress on the health front and you could get – these treatments are progressing nicely, vaccines are
progressing, you could see another stimulus build. It seems like the folks in Washington are getting closer on that.
You could actually see a fairly decent rebound next year, which could result in a steep in the curve.

mentioned versus classified?

Yeah. We published that in the Q. I would say, directionally it's up and it's mostly special mentioned. So you'll stay
tuned for the details on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thanks, Bruce. And then also on the credit side, I wanted to see if you could just give us a little bit
of update on what you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio? Are you beginning to see stress there? I
know you mentioned the mall REITs, but just curious about other properties, how that portfolio is trajecting? It
looks like you added a fair amount to the reserve this quarter there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think it's really what we mentioned, it's retail and hospitality where we're focused. If you click through the
different asset classes, office looks like it's holding up pretty well with rents being paid well. Multifamily looks like
it's holding up pretty well. We've got our eye on trends there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We don't have the big exposure to some of the cities [indiscernible] (00:41:15)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Right. Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

They get tips like New York and San Francisco, fortunately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then we get into industrial and healthcare, and those are also holding up quite well, so the place for focus is
on the retail and hospitality. On the hospitality side, we've got exposure to business travel, which has obviously
slowed, but we've got very diversified sponsors and we've got some support provided by those sponsors in terms
of flag change, which have overlay guarantees on some of that. So it's really around the other areas of retail and
we feel like we're in pretty good shape with the reserves we've put up at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think what we tried to do here was really look at it for an extended period of either lockdowns or consumer
behavioral shifts that goes well into 2021, and that puts more stress on these narrow sectors. Let's make sure
we've taken credit off the table and put up a sizable reserve there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And the other thing I'd mention is we are working with all of the sponsors. We really bank the best sponsors out
there and they're working with us and they're restructuring the properties that are having temporary dislocation.

operate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more on the efficiency, the $100 million, just to confirm, we
do not yet know how much will fall to the bottom line of that $100 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. That's good, John. So we conveyed – we communicated appropriately. So we are going to – we're working
on launching a number of work streams. Some of those are in Brendan's area in consumer, the big digitization
push. And so far, the tally is up to at least $100 million. So that's good news and we're going to keep trying to
drive that higher. We also have a couple pages in there and some of our strategic initiatives. And so one of our
objectives here is to really keep investing for our future so that we come out of this challenging period in even
better position with a stronger franchise that's positioned to grow and to continue to do well.
And so we're working through the pacing of some of those investments and which ones to prioritize. So we're kind
of reluctant at this point to give you a full update on expense guidance until we complete that work, but I'm sure
we knew there was going to be a clamoring for what have you got so far. So we've put the number out there. Stay
tuned to January, we'll give you all of that in the context of our full-year guidance that we do every January

17

expect to get next year, the approximate mix of like what comes through expenses of that and what comes
through revenues of that because you're talking about like these new revenue opportunities as you just alluded to,
Bruce? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean I think in – the majority of this is an expense-driven program. There are
some revenue opportunities that are there in the traditional TOP program as we have done historically. But for
example, the transformation piece of this is 100% expenses for the most part. And I would say that that's really
the main driver of the program. But we also do use the program to fund revenue opportunities as well and to drive
upside on that front.
I would hasten to add, though, that when you start doing the numbers, you're looking at a run rate target of around
$225 million by the end of this year. That rises to as high as $325 million, so there's $100 million there. And then
we also mentioned the additional $100 million at least that Bruce mentioned as well. So we wanted to make sure
that we weren't losing track of those different hundreds.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Very good. And then second question just, John, on the PPP in general. Many banks
have thought through that forgiveness might start in the fourth quarter. It seems like you guys are conservative in
terms of not at least putting it in your core – your NII guide, but can you just help us understand and I know it's
more of a timing question, but just what you expect and how do you expect just all go with regards to forgiveness
timing and also just how much was PPP in the 3Q NII as well? Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. I'll start off and maybe Brendan will comment on it. But in terms of process, I mean the forgiveness
process can take up to five months. There's many steps that have to be made. Maybe Brendan can talk about the
invitation approach that we're taking in the fourth quarter, but I think that our view is given the complexity there
that it would be appropriate to – in the outlook to not include any acceleration with respect to forgiveness benefit.
That said, we do, as you know, the way the accounting works is that we are incorporating the expected fees on a
[ph] net yield (00:47:00) basis over the life of the 24 months of these loans. And so, every quarter that goes by,
we are recognizing P&L that is attributable to the PPP program. In the third quarter, the yield on the program is
nearing somewhere between – nearing 3% in terms of yield and from a pre-tax standpoint, if you – it's maybe in
the $25 million range for the third quarter. So, that gives you a sense on all of that – when I call it pre-tax, all of
that that's really after the expenses. It's a tiny bit higher on the NII line, and that number will be with no
18


Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
(CFG) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
forgiveness, but we'll see that again in a similar number in the fourth quarter given the way that the accounting
works and if forgiveness is really a 1H 2021 event as we are forecasting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would say one thing on that, it's Bruce, and then I'll let Brendan go. But Ken, initially, we take it out over
roughly eight quarters, and I think we had $140 million, $150 million roughly to amortize on a straight line basis.
But we thought that forgiveness would occur much sooner. We had thought some of that would trickle into Q3 and
Q4, but now it looks like that will largely be a first half of 2021 event. But the spike is going to be lower since the
longer this goes towards the end of the period, then you won't get the same spike as if you had a massive
acceleration into, say, Q3 that would have really altered the timing in a material way. But at this point since we are
steadily recognizing and then there's less time remaining to accelerate, the spike shouldn't be as dramatic. Just to
just make that mathematical point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
On the timing, the one thing I would just add is keep in mind the customer doesn't need to incur interest charges
until October of next year. And so there's no huge pressure point for our customers to apply for forgiveness right
the second. And so with...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
They don't have to pay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
They don't have to pay. So with the various builds going through Congress that would possibly be quite positive to
these customers, there's a bit of a waiting game. And that's what we're hearing from most customers is that they'd
rather wait and see what flexibility is afforded to them before they jump in and start the forgiveness process. So
we're getting a handful trickle then.
And then to John's point, once the customer provides all their documentation, the SBA still has a three-month
window to stamp it and say, yes, it's able to be forgiven. And that's the recognition event is when the SBA stamps
it. So there's a bit of a tail on this. We expect that, as Bruce pointed and John pointed out to be a [indiscernible]
(00:49:56).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
A few two things. Some small business owners are being cautious here and just holding on to that cash to see
what the forgiveness turns [indiscernible] (00:50:03) they might have to pay it back, which one of the reasons we
still have elevated cash balances. So they've dipped into their own pocket to keep the lights going in the business.
And so I think there's just a bit of caution generally as we said.

Understood. Hey, one just quick clarification, John. That $25 million pre-tax was at the fee part of it or was that
also with the NII adjusted from the loan yield?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. So just in terms of credit, it sounds like the management overlays sort of most of the reserve build
this quarter. What did your CECL model – if we look at CECL by itself actually tell you to do with the reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think it's hard to parse it, Ken, actually because to us the CECL model is not just a macro forecast. It's a process
that involves many, many, many variables, and management judgment is one of those variables. So I think it's just
hard to parse that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Then maybe just on the same topic, I guess why apply that management overlays this quarter? I'm
sure you had some earlier in the year, but it seems like maybe this quarter had more of the qualitative
adjustments rather than [indiscernible] (00:51:36).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think we've had overlays and qualitative factors are part of the process every quarter. I think the reason to
call these out was you had a slight divergence. It looked like the macro forecast was a little better, the backdrop
was a little better. But what we're seeing is that consumer behavior and the effect of lockdowns is going to be
more prolonged than I think we saw when we were assessing it in the first quarter and second quarter.
We think it could be well into 2021 before we get back to life as we knew it and to normal lifestyle, which means
these retail and hospitality, entertainment, travel, all of that genre could still be in a difficult situation for longer. So
you wouldn't necessarily pick that up from your macro forecast. I mean that's a kind of unique aspect of certain
businesses are disproportionately impacted from the new normal, about how we're living our life. And so that's
why we're calling that out.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. A couple of – I'm going to just follow up on some of the themes that have been coming up. The release in
reserves, Bruce and John, that you're expecting in the fourth quarter, which loan categories do you think that
you're expecting to see that at this point? Where is that visibility coming from?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean I'll go and take that. Vivek, it's kind of like the way CECL works as you know. I mean we provide for
all of the loans that are outstanding at September 30 both for the loss content that we see after considering our
macroeconomic scenario and then our qualitative factors that we reviewed by loan category.
And if we're right, and it's very hard to say that you can be, there's so much uncertainty that a lot of that build as
you know in the third quarter came through the commercial portfolios. And as we mentioned earlier, CRE, retail
and hospitality, and we also mentioned casual dining as sectors where we built reserves. So once that's done,
then theoretically at least, you're just going to charge off against those reserves going forward, assuming you
were right about what the loss content is and what the scenario will be.
The rest of your provisioning then would only be focused on your front book activity and growth. So, where we're
going to grow going forward, let's say for example in the residential mortgage and student [ph] emergent spaces
(00:54:32), we would provide additional reserves for those loans as they come on as well as the C&I loans that
we're going to see as you get to the end of the fourth quarter. So it really is you have to sort of look at it in those
two buckets as [indiscernible] (00:54:49).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And just make an assumption that the environment won't deteriorate in a meaningful way so that you wouldn't
need to add to any further reserves around the back book. Now there could be some of that, but we don't see it –
a sufficient amount of it to result in a reserve build and a need for reserve build.

Okay. And what are you thinking about the student loan book because that forbearance rate has stayed pretty
high? It hasn't come down. It's higher than even resi mortgages. Can you comment on why that's the case? Have
they just not come up or – how long is the forbearance period? Have they just not come up yet or have they gone
– what percentage have gone in for an extension of the deferral?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So we're actually starting to see it gear down a little bit in the recent weeks. It was lagging a little bit principally
because the majority of our student loan book is student loan refi. And a lot of those customers also have
government loans which had significant forbearance periods that were automatically granted. And so, customers
were triggered by the government events and they called all the private lenders and banks and raised their hand
for forbearance, and there's sort of no reason for them to delink those two. So we've been aggressively working

with our customers to make sure we try to understand where they're at and if they have the capacity to pay. But if
they are still on the fence, we've been allowing them a little bit of leeway to land on their feet. But every underlying
dynamic we see in that portfolio is quite positive. Recall it's a super prime portfolio. The credit is [ph] $780 million
plus (00:56:28) in that portfolio, and particularly in the refi portfolio they'll make six-figure income and that's the
sector that's been the least impacted by unemployment. And so we feel quite strong that this is – there's no
significant underlying dynamic that's different in student than any other portfolio in consumer.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, John, you mentioned that the hedges
should mostly roll off and the headwinds from the hedges rolling off should be pretty – for the most part fully
realized by the end of 2021 and early 2022. And I think we've estimated that the headwind is probably in the $200
million, $250 million annualized from the hedges rolling off. Can you – is that – I mean can you just give us a
sense of the magnitude of the incremental headwinds if our number is more or less right? And how should we see
those incremental headwinds sort of materializing in 2021 and in 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It would be a fraction of that. Without really getting into the numbers, it's not nearly that big. It's not...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...it's nowhere near that from what we can see. How we track through 2020, I mean you've got to think about what
the terms are which we publish. And you can see what the terms are on those swaps, I believe. But it's much,
much lower than that. And I'd say we just bring it back bigger picture to ensure those are running off. But
mortgage business has been part of our hedging strategy all along. A majority of the NIM headwinds on a
cumulative basis are being offset in 2020 and 2021 by the mortgage business. And we also have a very
significant lever with respect to interest-bearing deposit costs this time around in [ph] SERP (00:58:50) given all of
the investments we've made in the analytics and product capabilities and orientation of our bank across consumer
and commercial with respect to the relationship-driven deposit gathering that we have embarked upon, which
takes years to do, but that started many years ago. So we're starting to see that bear fruit. Those are the things I
think about when you're trying to consider the puts and takes for next year.

Yeah. I get that but maybe we can go with the mechanics offline, but there does seem to be a sense from the
investment community that the headwinds are we're talking about on a static basis not factoring in some of the
offsets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But just to be clear, you're saying that that estimate, just on a
static basis, nothing else, just the hedges rolling off, that that number is way too high. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
That's correct. That's correct. And we can take you through the math on that offline with some publicly available
information and we'll just make sure that you're seeing it the way we see it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Just one other question on NII. What are you assuming for forgiveness ultimately throughout the course of
the first half of next year? What percentage of loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So there's a 15% tail that we think will be forgiven on the backend. And so the other 85% will come through
mostly in 1H, but there's some that'll come through in the third quarter as well.

Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point
Hi. Just on your NIM guidance, was just curious how much deposit growth you're assuming that feeds into that, if
any, or if you're looking for more of that continued favorable mix shift that you've been having there, favoring the
lower cost of deposits? Go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's primarily a mix shift story. I mean we've gotten surge deposits like many other banks. We think some of
that may stick around for quite a while in through – well into 2021. So there's that benefit. We've paid down
everything you can pay down and we're sitting around with some excess cash. And so, excess cash is a drag on
NIM, call it about a 2 basis point drag or so on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the fourth quarter, but it's getting up
to near, call it, 8 to 10 basis points on an absolute basis in the fourth quarter, all that excess cash. We'll look to
see that pay down over time. But as it relates to deposits, really we're seeing great mix shift into DDA. We've had,
I think, three years running now pure leading DDA growth. And that's part of the mix story. And it's just
accelerating that trend that already was happening with us that's nice to see on the deposit side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point
Yeah. Well, you mentioned the cash that's sitting there. I mean are there any lumpy maturities on the borrowing
side that maybe you can take advantage of and use some of that cash to pay those down, anything over the next
year that we can look forward, that's [indiscernible] (01:02:15)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, it's not a lot. So our flow of funds are down to zero. And then our senior debt we only have very,
very modest maturities coming in in early 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We just called one issue and we did a sub debt exchange. So we're working that as much as we can, but not a
huge amount of opportunity there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point
All right. And then, if you guys have any color on new loan yields and securities purchase yields that you guys are
seeing today. I'm just trying to get a sense for where we could ultimately be going on the average earning asset
yields if we continue to see this flat curve over the next couple of years.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2020
Yeah. And, so for securities, I'll take and maybe Don or Brendan want to talk about spreads, but I mean, on the
loans side. But it's not a great story on the securities side, there's a 40, 45 basis point, just call it, negative front
book, back book in terms of runoff, which comes off at around, call it, 190 basis points. And you've got
reinvestment coming on at around 140 or 145 basis points on the front book for securities. So, that's the story
there. I think in commercial, we're seeing strong – sort of spreads are up, but rates are down. So, that's good.
In the consumer side of things, we're seeing some interesting positive trends there in auto, which has been quite
good and really strong spreads there, and maybe I'll just let Don or Brendan add anything else.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think auto has been very strong, student loan refi has also been very strong. We're seeing a significant
increase in margin across, basically, all the products. So I feel...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
We have also talked merchant, we just had a nice string of wins and...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Apple just launched their – is launching their new product.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Our merchant business kind of has a profile of a credit card business. Apple, we're gearing in. So the new product
release for them right now with the 5G phones. So we're enthusiastic about that. Microsoft All Access has geared
up for this big launch right now seasonally. We just launched, as John pointed out earlier, five new merchant
partners, really centered in home improvement, electronics and fitness, similar to our Peloton relationship with the
firm. So we're really bullish about the growth there and we're actually getting some really decent momentum that
should really help offset some of the yield headwind from some of the other portfolios by bringing them something
in that high yield.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. On commercial, we're generally getting anywhere from 10 to 30 basis points better spreads on new
originations, and we're also putting LIBOR force and a lot of transactions, which are helping the overall yield. That
seems to be holding.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. All right. Thanks for the question.
