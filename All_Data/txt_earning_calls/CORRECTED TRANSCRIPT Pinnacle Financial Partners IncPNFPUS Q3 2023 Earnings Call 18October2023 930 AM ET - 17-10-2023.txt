Thank you, Paul, and thank you for joining us here this morning. Most of you have endured these calls before and
so, you know, we're going to begin every one of these calls with our Shareholder Value Dashboard, because
these metrics are our north star. There are a lot of interesting things that can be talked about, but ultimately we're
here to produce shareholder value and this is how we think you do that. And of course, always us who believe
non-GAAP measures because this is how we really manage the business. At a glance, you can see that we
continue to grow revenue and EPS more rapidly and reliably than peers. We continue to grow our balance sheet
volumes more rapidly and reliably than peers, and that we relentlessly focus on tangible book value.
Also, our asset quality continues to be strong with problem asset metrics continue to outperform peers. At 23
basis points, net charge-offs are excellent, but a little lumpy. You can see that they jumped up just a little bit this
quarter because of a large, much publicized syndication we were in. But generally, our non-performers and
classified assets have been peer leading with NPAs ranked number three among peers in Q2 and classified
assets number two among peers. So, from 30,000 feet, it's my opinion that we continue to deliver on all the key
drivers of real long-term shareholder value creation.
So, with that, Harold, let's take a more in-depth look at the quarter.

Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We will again start with deposits reporting linked-quarter annualized
average growth of almost 19% in the third quarter was again a real positive for us. The third quarter was yet
another indication that obtaining deposits in an environment where competitors can be unpredictable is very much
doable for this franchise.
Early in the third quarter, competitive rate pressures remain fairly intense. As we approach the middle part of the
quarter, it appeared that rate pressures did subside somewhat. The mix shift of non-interest bearing to interest
bearing slowed during the third quarter as we were down $112 million much less than prior quarters of this year.
All-in deposit cost increased to 2.92%. I'd like to point out that we ended the quarter with the spot rate at quarter
end of 2.97%, only 5 basis points higher than the average for the quarter.
That is the smallest difference we've seen between the average rate and the quarter end rate in a long time,
signaling to us perhaps a much more modest increase in deposit rates in the near term and are optimistic about
the pace of deposit rate increases as we head into the fourth quarter. We also believe we will continue to be
disciplined as to the relationship between pricing and growth of our deposit book. We believe we can continue at
a more deliberate pace for gathering deposits without leaning heavily on the rate component of our growth. As
many of you know, our goal is to be the best organic deposit grower and we feel like we are on our way. Terry will
speak more to our deposit gathering capabilities in a minute.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
The third quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us as we were reporting 8.4% linked-quarter
annualized average loan growth. Given that, we're maintaining our EOP loan growth for 2023 at low-to-mid-teens
growth. As we've mentioned over the last several quarters, we're exhibiting much more discipline on fixed rate
loan pricing, which ended the quarter with average fixed rate loan yields on new originations of 7.17%.
Spreads maintenance on floating and variable rate loans continues to be strong. We're pleased with yields on our
originations and believe we can continue to maintain similar loan spreads as we enter the fourth quarter.
As the top chart reflects, our NIM decreased 14 basis points, which is more than we anticipated at the start of the
quarter. What we did anticipate was an increase in average cash as we have more cash on our balance sheet
spill over at the end of the second quarter into the third quarter. During the third quarter, our cash balances did
decrease modestly, as our liquidity did decrease during the quarter. So, we're believing that liquidity will be less
impactful on our margins in the fourth quarter.
That said, with a backdrop of slowing deposit pricing and with fixed rate loan repricing at better spreads, we're
growing more confident that our NIM has found the bottom, or we at least are fairly close.
We're anticipating our fourth quarter NIM to approximate our third quarter NIM or perhaps be slightly down.
Obviously, should deposit pricing heat up in conjunction with competitors just becoming more aggressive, we
might need to revisit that assertion, but as we sit here today, we feel like we are close.
Our rate forecast we believe is consistent with most rate forecasts out there. Our planning assumption is that
we're not going to see another Fed rate increases and future Fed rate decreases are not expected until the
second half of next year, because of a lever in the higher-for-longer rate environment.
With that, we don't believe a near-term Fed rate increase will be that impactful to us either in the fourth quarter or
as we enter 2024. As you know, the macro environment is volatile and very unpredictable right now, and given
that, we will have a continued bias towards elevated interest rate risk management, guarding liquidity of our
balance sheet and modest capital accretion.
As for credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continue to perform
well in the third quarter. Our belief is that credit should remain consistent for the remainder of the year. Our credit
officers continue their routine periodic credit reviews of the portfolio and bring resources to bear for borrowers
exhibiting potential signs of weakness. The CRE appetite chart on the bottom right is largely unchanged from the
prior quarter, but does reflect perhaps a slightly more conservative appetite for multifamily and industrial from
what we have shown over the last few quarters.
Charge-offs did increase to 23 basis points during the quarter. During the quarter, there was a lot of information
out there about a single syndicated credit out of Atlanta. We were a participant in this syndication for about $10
million. Not sure of any recovery opportunities at this point, but we will continue to work with the lead bank and the
syndicate to recover whatever might be available.
We have shown this slide before, the top left chart deals with trends in construction originations. We began
dramatically reducing our appetite for construction last summer, which is consistent with the chart. A modest
amount of new construction originations during the third quarter was primarily due to new home construction
loans under existing officer guidance lines to our residential homebuilders.

Secondly, much discussion about renewals of the commercial real estate fixed rate loans, which is the objective
of the chart on the top right. Over the next several quarters, we will have approximately $100 million in fixed rate
commercial real estate renewals coming up for repricing, where the average rate on these loans is currently
around 4.5%.
Our current yield target for these loans at renewal will be in the 7.5% to 8% range. All together, we have about $6
billion in fixed rate loans maturing over the next two years, with a weighted average yield of 4.4%. Thus, we see
real opportunity from a repricing perspective.
Now onto fees, and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding BHG, the impact of the gain on sale
of fixed assets and the loss on the sale of investment securities, fee revenues were up slightly from the second
quarter. Couple of items to point out here, which we believe are noteworthy.
During the quarter, we recognized $5.9 million revenues from a solar tax investment that we entered into in
December of 2022. We received a third-party report as to the adjusted value of the investment during the third
quarter, which provided us with support for the results we posted.
We're excited about our solar business and what we believe it can and will accomplish. Starting last year, it's
relatively new to us, as we only have about $130 million in balances. But we have a staff with seasoned industry
veterans from large cap franchises, so we expect great things from this business line.
Just like many of our other equity investment, valuation gains and losses are difficult to predict and thus, the
ongoing contribution to our fee revenues will always be choppy. As I mentioned, we'll go into BHG more in just a
second, but wanted to emphasize that BHG continues to represent less of our pre-tax revenues this quarter than
in previous quarters.
As we noted in last night's press release, we believe BHG has decreased to a 9% contribution to this year's fully
diluted EPS compared to approximately 20% last year. We anticipate that fee revenues, excluding BHG, the gain
on the sale of fixed assets and investment securities losses will come in at around a mid-to-high, single-digit
growth rate for 2023 over 2022.
Not a lot to say here this time on expenses, total expenses came in about where we thought. We did adjust our
incentive accrual downward to 65% of target this quarter based on where we believe our performance metrics will
come in for all of 2023. Our outlook for expense growth for 2023 over 2022 remains in the high single, low double-
digit range, same as last time.
One quick comment on FDIC insurance. We are expecting a special assessment to replenish the bank insurance
fund before the year end. Our understanding is that the industry will likely recognize that as a charge to the P&L
when that amount is known. Just so you know, we expect that charge to be in the $25 million to $30 million range,
and this charge is not reflected in our outlook for 2023 expense growth.
Our tangible book value per common share decreased to $48.78 at quarter end, down slightly from June 30. The
decrease was primarily attributable to the rise in intermediate term interest rates during the third quarter and the
resulting impact of that on the market values of our AFS portfolio and, of course, AOCI.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter is that our capital ratios will likely be flat to down next quarter. Contributing to
this will be the usual fourth quarter P&L matters, fourth quarter loan growth, et cetera. Of note is that BHG will
report their Day 1 CECL adjustment in the fourth quarter and this will serve to reduce our capital accounts by a

modest amount. This Day 1 non-cash adjustment will not impact our fourth quarter earnings. Repeat, it will not
impact our fourth quarter earnings and should approximate a charge to capital of approximately $40 million.
Subsequently, BHG will likely need to maintain their reserves at amounts approximating 9% of total balance sheet
loans. The impact of maintaining loss reserves at those levels going forward has been considered in our fourth
quarter outlook for BHG.
We believe the actions we've taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital ratio have served us
well and we have no plans currently to alter our tier 1 capital stack in any sort of common or preferred offering.
The chart on the bottom left of the slide details several pro forma capital ratios as of the end of September.
Although we don't anticipate significant changes to the capital rules, we're pleased with these results and believe
they will likely compare favorably to other peer banks.
Now a few comments about BHG. The top right chart is consistent with our previous quarterly earnings calls and
details that production has been consistent over the last several quarters at about $1 billion to $1.2 billion per
quarter. Placements to the bank network were less in the third quarter, while placements to the institutional
investor were again at the highest level ever and signal that demand for BHG paper by some of the most
respected asset managers in the country continues to be really strong.
As we look to the fourth quarter, BHG believes origination volumes will likely be less than Q3 as they continue to
shrink their credit box, and they believe sales into the bank network could experience some decline over the next
few quarters as their client base continues to wrestle with a more restrictive funding environment. And we also
believe BHG will likely want to build loan inventories in the fourth quarter as they head into 2024.
That said, BHG's Bank Network, which we believe is very unique and we believe will be difficult to replicate by any
BHG competitor will continue to grow and provide ample liquidity to BHG.
As to liquidity, we presented the slide last time in order to provide additional insight with regard to the significant
liquidity channels available to BHG and placement of their loan production. BHG successfully negotiated two
private whole loan sales of about $400 million during the third quarter. Importantly, these type sales are executed
with no recourse to BHG.
Lastly, BHG is anticipating their eight capital markets transaction here in the fourth quarter. They're currently
anticipating the volume for the securitization will likely be in the $300 million range. All things considered, we
believe BHG has assembled a very enviable liquidity platform that should serve them well for many years to
come.
This is the usual information we've shown in the past [indiscernible] (00:15:38) spread trend since the first quarter
of 2021. The top chart represents the gain on sale of the off-balance sheet bank network, and the bottom chart is
a blended chart of all on-balance sheet funding, which incorporates the historical buildup of balances. As
anticipated, spreads for all balance sheet loan placements have come in somewhat with higher rates and a
tightening of BHG's credit box.
During the third quarter, the blended spreads for all balance sheet loans were slightly higher than the bank
network, given the balance sheet loans reflect the buildup of balances over the last three years. As we head into
the fourth quarter, BHG believe that spreads for both on and off balance sheet loans should be consistent with the
third quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
As we've noted in previous quarters, BHG has tightened its credit box over the last several quarters, particularly
with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base. Production volumes remain strong, even with tighter credit
underwriting. BHG refreshes its credit score monthly, always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing
base.
Credit scores are obviously up from previous years. The vintage chart on the right is helpful to understand how
much underwriting has improved and does impact the loss content in the portfolio. At the top of the chart, on the
lines reflecting originations in 2012 and through 2015, lines begin to level out at cumulative loss rates of 10% to
12%. Vintages after 2015 begin to reflect improved performance, with the lines leveling out within the 5% to 10%
loss range.
BHG continues to allocate resources to the post-COVID vintages of 2021 through the first half of 2022 as those
vintages, BHG believe, were graded higher than the borrower ultimately wanted and thus skewing the loss rates
higher for those loans.
This slide again provides more information on credit and detailed reserve losses for both off balance sheet and on
balance sheet loans. BHG is optimistic about credit at the end of the third quarter. Typically for BHG,
approximately 70% of the loss is incurred in the first three years of origination. But with rate inflation, as was
mentioned about the 2021 and the first half of 2022 vintages, loans should and has come to light sooner. As a
result, BHG has expanded significant resources to bulk-up collection activities and will be instituting in-person
closings from new borrowers, which were suspended during COVID.
Although higher than historical losses are likely for the near term, the credit performance of the portfolio does
appear to be improving, holding towards cautious optimism as we enter the fourth quarter and into 2024. BHG
had another strong quarter with approximately $1 billion on originations and are on track to achieve $3.8 billion to
$4 billion originations this year, which is slightly less than last year, but consistent with our outlook from the last
quarter.
As we mentioned last quarter, BHG had a conservative bias going into the third quarter such that as they
continually tightened their credit box, production in the last half of the year was expected to be lower than the first
half. The current fourth quarter loan production forecast should approximate $600 million to $800 million in order
to follow 2023 full-year guidance, which is less than the quarterly production levels thus far this year.
During the quarter, BHG record several one-time expenses related to the markdown of a building they anticipate
selling as well as markdowns of some software assets and other items that were related to some business loans
that BHG has elected to not support any longer. These one-time charges amounted to approximately $10 million
during the third quarter. These amounts have been incorporated in BHG results and outlook for 2023.
Net earnings for 2023 are forecasted at $175 million to $185 million inclusive of the one-time adjustments just
mentioned. And is basically consistent with the range from last year's forecast.
Quickly, the usual slide detailing our financial outlook for 2023, we have a bias currently toward a more cautious
outlook when it comes to credit, interest rates and capital. Our job is to manage the risks that face this franchise
every day. What we know is that our business model remains relationship based, nimble and resilient. Our
management team has significant experience and has tackled economic downturns before. We have great
confidence that we'll be able to manage the high-quality banking franchise that our shareholders have come to
expect from us and can currently handle whatever curveballs get thrown our way.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Harold. Warren Buffett and others have famously said, manage the fundamentals and tell the story, and
the stock will take care of itself. I believe that. At Pinnacle, we are managing what we believe are the
fundamentals, the critical variables to creating outsize shareholder value. And so my goal here now is to tell the
story, to crystallize extraordinarily valuable deposit franchise we built.
As an industry, we've been in a war the last three quarters, and in the fog of war, it's easy to get confused about
what's really important. We've all just witnessed three high-profile franchises go to zero, primarily because of two
things. Number one, their enterprise wide risk management, in my judgment, they all take extraordinary risk and
two, the stickiness of their deposits. And so the risk of management teams will undertake matters, and how they
use their security book matters, and how they manage interest rate sensitivity matters and how they manage
concentrations matters. And then how they attract and retain their deposits matters.
Personally, I wouldn't want to belong any bank our size that stuck in the commodity trap. That means an
undifferentiated franchise from a client's perspective. Because in that case, there's no ability to reliably grow
deposits at a pace sufficient to sustain outsized revenue and EPS growth and no ability to retain deposits in
difficult times, which again jeopardizes the reliability of their growth.
But a bank that can attract talent by virtue of being an employer of choice, a bank that utilizes its client experience
as the primary basis by which it attracts clients and retains clients, a bank that can rapidly and reliably grow net
interest income, the largest component of the EPS, that's a valuable deposit franchise.
Anyone who's heard me tell Pinnacle story, has heard me talk about the Pinnacle philosophy. That excited
associates produce engaged clients and nothing enriches shareholders like engaged clients, made in raving fans
that bring more business to you and refuse to leave you in times of uncertainty. Many times when I discussed that
philosophy, I try to live the prove-its, the workplace awards we've won, the service and brand awards we've won.
The outsize shareholder returns, we've produced over short, medium and long-term timeframes. But today, I want
to show you the power of building a great workplace of being an employer of choice. Happily, most of the banks
that have leading market share positions in our footprint are hemorrhaging talent.
And while I can't provide a metric to prove it, I do believe we're the employer of choice throughout our footprint.
What bank do you know that's produced a compound annual growth rate of revenue, producers of 7%? A 7% per
annum increase in the number of experienced revenue producers while still producing top quartile profitability,
that's a valuable deposit franchise.
And by virtue of the associate engagement, you're able to create, you provide clients an experience they like to
love, that engages them in such a way that they want to bring you more of their business and they want their
friends and colleagues to experience the same thing. Those are what the researchers refer to as promoters.
At 57, according to JD Power, we have the second highest net promoter score of all the top 50 banks in the
United States based on assets set, number two in the country, that's pretty top gun. Of course, JD Power has
more of a consumer slant, so we rely a little more on Coalition Greenwich, which is more focused on businesses.
According to Greenwich, our ability to create an experience that results in raving fans, promoters is literally one of
the best in the nation. I know no competitor in our footprint is coming close to a 79 net promoter score, and I'd be
surprised if any bank in the country is exceeding the 79 net promoter score.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
And of course, that begins to explain our substantial outperformance in terms of deposit growth shown here on
the far right. Our net deposit growth, our ability to attract and retain deposits is wildly better than peers, both prior
to the bank failures and subsequent to the bank failures. And I'd say that's a valuable deposit franchise.
Nashville is the best case study of how this all works. Using the FDIC summary deposit market share data, you
can see on the far left, the market share leaders in Nashville in June of 2000, prior to Pinnacle opening in October
of 2000. I included the 2022 data in the middle not only so you can easily see the outstanding market share we
took and who we took it from but so you can see the most recent data on the far right that our model continues to
grow deposit market share in Nashville in 2023 at a very rapid pace. So much for the law of large numbers.
What I hope I bring to light for you is that while it is incredibly advantageous to be in large high-growth markets,
which we are, nothing, literally nothing is more valuable than a differentiated experience that can reliably take
share from the weaker competitors that dominate our markets. Think about that.
Over 23 years in existence in Nashville, the top three banks gave up 27% share and we took nearly 21% of the
market from them. That's a valuable deposit franchise. And honestly, I'm not aware of a single bank in the country
with that kind of deposit building franchise. And while we've been at it the longest in Nashville, based on FDIC
market share data for 2023, we're growing share in virtually every market that we're in. All of those listed here
have positive share growth.
And look at this, when you compare the deposit volumes we're now producing in markets like Atlanta and
Washington DC to our first three years in Nashville, where we now dominate, you have to be blown away by how
that propels sustainable growth going forward. That's a valuable deposit franchise.
As I've alluded to several times now to be a valuable deposit franchise, in addition to your ability to attract
deposits, is critical that you can retain deposits in times of crisis. And we don't need to invent metrics that we hope
might be predictive of how sticky bank's deposits are, we can know, right? I would say the best test of a bank's
ability to retain clients was how well they did in that period of time leading up to and immediately following the
Silicon Valley Bank value.
Think about it, it was the worst bank scare since the Great Depression, and it occurred in this time of frictionless
transfers. It's never been easier to transfer bank balances than at this time and really that's we saw three
relatively large bank failures fail precisely for that reason, but at Pinnacle in that extreme crisis, not one of our 200
largest depositors left us in the month following those failures, not one.
And the balances of those 200 totaled $3.9 billion at the time of the SVB failure and $3.9 billion roughly a month
after that failure. It's just hard to leave a bank you love and trust, and that's a valuable deposit franchise. A further
proof of the power of the franchise is that according to Greenwich, over the next 6 to 12 months in our footprint,
Pinnacle is the most likely bank to earn more business and the least at risk of losing business, the most likely
bank to earn business and the least likely of losing business.
For each of the three banks that dominate our footprint in terms of existing deposit client share, in other words, for
each of the three market share leaders, between 17% and 22% of their clients indicate they're likely to lose
business in the next 6 to 12 months. That's a huge opportunity for us to produce outsized growth, given our
proven ability to take their share.

And because our clients engagement with us, nearly 40% of our clients indicate a likelihood that we'll earn more
of their business. I would say that a franchise is most likely to earn new business and least likely to lose business
is a very valuable deposit franchise. And of course, the ultimate goal of that is to rapidly and reliably increase total
shareholder returns. Over the last 10 years, our total shareholder returns have substantially outperformed all our
peers. As we've grown in asset size, our PE multiple has contracted more than most of our peers, largely I
suspect due to fear of the fall of large numbers. And so for us to produce outsized total shareholder returns as our
P/E contract, we had to substantially outgrow peers in terms of EPS, which we did.
But given that net interest income by far the largest component of EPS, it'd be hard to substantially outgrow peers
in terms of EPS over an extended period of time without growing them in terms of net interest income. And it'd be
hard to outgrow peers over the long haul in terms of net interest income without outsized loan and deposit volume
growth.
So, hopefully, you'll agree that a bank that can attract talent by virtue of being an employer of choice, bank utilizes
its client experience as the primary basis by which it attract clients and retains clients, a bank that can rapidly and
reliably grow its net interest income, the largest component of EPS, that's a highly valuable deposit franchise.

I want to start on the deposit side and specifically on deposit mix. So you guys had very strong growth in the
interest checking account, right? It's over half on the average balance and that rate is now 3.77%. Can you give
some color, is that where new customers are coming into the bank or see a migration from non-interest bearing
into that account? Is that where we should expect to see outsized growth?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Yeah, I think we'll see more in the money market accounts, interest checking accounts. I think a lot of the new
strategies, and the new verticals will point clients in that direction. Looking at our new account growth over the
last, call it three months, Steve, about 10% to 15%, now it is in non-interest bearing. So we're still attracting class
and need the operating accounts. But I think a lot of the sales force is aimed at more products that are more
aimed towards those interest checking and money market accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Harold, you called out the spot rate on total deposits, but what about this account? Where are you pricing
relative to the 3.77% right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I don't have that right now, but I would imagine that new account growth is probably in the 3.77%. Just a
wild guess, Steve, I would think the spot rate is probably in the, call it, probably pretty close to the 2.97%, maybe
a little north of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, helping to offset that, earning asset yields are picking up a bit, 21 bps quarter-over-quarter.
Given where longer-term rates have moved, Harold, should we expect more of a lift in our earning asset yields
coming in the fourth quarter? Is that picking up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we are. We're expecting some more lift primarily through the repricing of the fixed rate loan renewals. We
got to – like we mentioned, about $100 million in construction coming in. But I think all together, we're looking at
somewhere close to maybe, call it, $300 million or $400 million in fixed rate renewals coming through this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, if we put those together, you think NIM is flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. Is it safe to say that'll
likely be the bottom of net interest margin for this cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's what we're hoping for, Steve. We're really hoping that it was this quarter that the bottom is when we
hit. But we've looked at the projections for the fourth quarter, several different ways under several different
scenarios and it looks like we're really close.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then on the expense side, I appreciate all the commentary that more of the expenses are now being
directed at revenue producers versus support staff. When I balance the commentary that you're putting out, Terry,
is that you're putting out the word to accelerate the pace of new hiring, right, just given the market opportunity. But

there's less pressure on back office. When I put those together, how should we start to think about expense
growth for next year? Could you give us just a rough range? Because I don't know how to put those two together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we're looking at the 2024 expense plan right now and we got to be – the largest increase in expenses that
we're hopeful to cover would be our incentive cost. We're accruing 65%, so we'll add 35% into the plan for next
year. We are introducing to our board and the comp committee several different ways that we think we can cover
that additional cost and still produce the revenue growth that I think everybody expects us to produce.
So, we're obviously not going to introduce into our expense plan any number that it's going to cause our EPS to
be unduly hit. So, we're looking at what our projections are next year for us and our peers. We're likely to try to
achieve some percentage growth and likely – well, we'll always be trying to get into the top quartile of that group.
So, I know that's a lot of word salad for you, Steve, but at the same time, we're not really ready to kind of talk
about where we are on expenses. Terry has challenged us to look at our expense base with a lot more diligence
here this quarter as we look into 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
All right. But Harold, if we just put together new hiring with less back office, does that imply less pressure on
expenses or more pressure on expenses because of that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, that'll obviously produce better operating leverage on that particular notion, for sure. We don't intend to hire
as many in the support groups next year as we've done over the last two years. So, that is an added benefit. What
I want to make sure is that we get on the table that we're also planning to increase our expense base next year to
more of a target payout or incentive approval. So, just don't let us forget – don't forget about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, I think on what you're chasing there, on just the impact of the net hiring of revenue producers and non-
revenue producers, that ought to be a net positive. And again, I think what Harold is trying to do is make sure
everybody gets it, that our incentives are tied to performance. And so, we're hoping to produce a performance that
warrants the target payout or above next year. And so, that, in and of itself, is a big increase to the incentive line.
But the item you're chasing on the net impact of hiring, it ought to be a net positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. Okay. And maybe just lastly, just if I zoom out, right, when you look at loan and deposit growth, just
full-year expectations for this year. Maybe for you, Terry, as you look at the strength of your markets, the pace of
new hiring, do you see us exiting 2023 and entering 2024 with more momentum than what we saw in 2023? Or is
it about the same? Thanks.

I would think it'd be more momentum in 2024. This has been quite a year, lots of concerns about interest rates;
when you had it in, lots of concerns about inflation quickly into the bank failures and bang, bang, bang, boy, just a
lot of opportunity for caution. But I would say, we've stayed – you know better than I do what all the variables are
out here to figure. But it feels a lot more stable as I look at what our business model is today than it did in early
2023.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brett Rabatin from Hovde Group. Brett, your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to talk about the kind of the normalization of credit
and just you obviously were into loan credit, like quite a few regional banks were that raised net charge-offs a little
bit this quarter. But wanted just to ask about the $65 million increase in classified assets, if there was anything
that was sort of more normal. Or can you talk maybe just about that in general? And then, just maybe we can talk
about the SNC book and how big that is and how you think about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. As far as charge-offs for this quarter, without the amount express charge-off, I think we'd be somewhere
consistent with the prior quarters. We think going into the fourth quarter, we don't see anything outsized currently
that would warrant us, thinking that charge-offs are going to increase significantly from that where we are today.
Brett, did that give what you were talking about? Are you interested in more information on...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Yeah, I know that one credit kind of impacted net charge-offs, but just wanted to kind of hear about the
increase in classified if there was anything that was underlying there that had a commonality. And then, just
maybe if you could give any color on the SNC book and just any characteristics of that portfolio, how much you
lead, how you, kind of, run that portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, the classified did bump up on us. I think the credit officers are all over that one. It's a healthcare credit that
we have banked for a while and they just believe that their metrics are not looking where they – or they're not
performing at where they need to be performing, and so they've downgraded it. That contributed to – primarily the
increase in classified this quarter was that one credit. So, that was that.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
As far as the SNC book is concerned, we're running about 7% of total loans in our shared national credits. So, the
way we approach that largely is we want in-market – the loans themselves, we want them to be in-market. We
want them to be relevant to our business development such that we can bank the principles of the business. And
we've traditionally done that here in Nashville and in other markets.
The one credit that charged-off this quarter, there's a little bit of an anomaly for us. Not only I know there's been a
lot of discussion about it being idiosyncratic and all of that. It was also kind of unusual for us because there was a
bunch of banks in it and we were at the end of the line. And so, with that, that's not something we normally like to
do. So, I don't think you'll see a similar event on those particular matters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Brett. On that thing on the sort of normalization of credit metrics, I think you probably heard me say they'll
have to normalize. There's no chance we can operate at historic lows forever. And so, they'll have to normalize.
But when you sort of look in there, your non-performers are down during the quarter. Classifieds, my bet is even
after that increase, will probably still be the third best in the peer group. And so, again, they're going to have to
pick up normalized, but it still feels really good from my perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay, that's helpful, guys. And then maybe I just want to make sure I understood on the guidance back on the
margin in the fourth quarter, it kind of seems like you've got, assuming the trend continues of slower upward
trajectory of funding costs and quite a bit of assets repricing in the fourth quarter. I'm not saying you're
sandbagging in the margin guidance, but it just seems like the tenor would be a little bit better. Are you just being
cautious on that relative to the deposit struggles for the industry this year and potentially an increase in
competitiveness around deposit pricing or is there something else that I'm missing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I don't think you're missing. We do believe that we're – like we said, we're near bottom, if not at the bottom on
our margin. We think we've got great opportunities on loan repricing like you talked about. We think the deposit
book is behaving well. We will keep our fingers crossed as to whether or not we can move the margin up. But as
we sit today, we think we are where we are and we think we're going to be in pretty good shape as we go into
2024.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for the question. Just keeping with that same line of comments, lot of discussion around net interest
margin. I'm just wondering about net interest income and how that acts in the higher-for-longer environment. Is
the expectation here that as long as the Fed is higher for longer, NII is accelerating. The growth in that NII is
accelerating, or is there some offsetting dynamic that might keep that growth rate more limited?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes, that's a great question. I think from our perspective, the way our book typically behaves, as we've got all
these fixed rate loans that are going to reprice in this higher-for-longer kind of narrative. But if the Fed kind of
keeps the lid on short-term rates, that's where most of our deposit pricing will likely be influenced by. So if you
don't see any more rate increases, then the competitive pressures will be what drives kind of our deposit cost.
And we believe that we're really competitive on deposit cost presently. So we don't think we've got a lot of – I
mean, we'll obviously have some increases in deposits due to competitive rate pressures, but at the same time
we don't think we've got nearly the hill to get over that we've already conquered.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe one for Terry in the release, you mentioned a couple of times more vulnerable competitors
and asking your line leaders to accelerate their efforts in recruiting. Can you maybe just talk through the
competitive landscape? I know you've had good success in picking up talent and market share from some of the
larger banks. Now there's some dislocation from regional banks in that space as well. Maybe just talk through the
broader competitive landscape. And then, if you could put some numbers around what an accelerating effort for
recruiting might look like in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think the – thank you for nice question, give me a chance to clarify here a little bit. So I think from a
competitive standpoint, the market share leaders are in our Southeastern footprint generally in almost every major
urban market, they're going to be dominated by three and to some extent maybe four banks, Truist, Wells Fargo,
Bank of America and Regions. And so that's the line of scrimmage for us tomorrow.
You know, lot of people over the years ask, how do you compete with this little bank or that little bank. Generally, I
don't know the answer to because the line of scrimmage is always those market share leaders. We are finding
and I think I mentioned in my comments, a lot of those banks that dominate our market are emerging talent, some
due to integration issues, some due to, I think, regulatory pressures, all those sorts of things.
But if you think about those banks I listed there, most of them have a difficult landscape which brings pressure in
their organization, a lot of them are cutting staff, a lot of them are losing staff because of the continued rollout of
tightened policies and all those kinds of things. And so my belief is there, we've enjoyed vulnerability among those
competitors really throughout our existence, but I would say that the vulnerabilities today seem higher, say more
than the vulnerabilities that we've enjoyed through our first 23 years. And so that's sort of the backdrop of what
would cause me to say, hey, we need to be seasoned this opportunity. I don't mean to be dramatic, but I do
honestly believe that it is a once in a generation opportunity to build a big franchise on the shoulders of that
disruption.

In terms of what does that mean in terms of hiring people, I think you've followed us a while. You know that I think
over the last three years, prior to 2023, we set a record for the new volume of revenue producers that we hired,
we won't do that this year. You know, maybe be down, say, 30% this year from previous records of revenue hires.
My belief is we'll take it back north to approach those previous records so you might be able to hire 20% more
revenue producers next year than this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great color. Thank you for that. And then just lastly for me on BHG, I know in recent years, there's
been discussion on maybe lowering overall ownership or getting more creative in an effort to avoid some of that
CECL impact. With the CECL impact now here already and embedded in kind of the capital position in the fourth
quarter, does that change your longer term view on partnership with BHG? Does that maybe entice you to stick
with the current structure for a longer period of time? Or is there still a want to maybe reduce some of the
exposure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Timur. Thanks for the question. I don't believe CECL impacts our view of BHG, our relationship with BHG
and what our outlook is for BHG. We still have a great partnership with them. We meet with them routinely. We
understand what their strategies are now going into 2024. We're optimistic about what they can accomplish, and
we think they're building a very valuable franchise over the short and the intermediate terms that could be
valuable to anyone that might think that that going into that market segment would be advantageous for them. So
we're proud of what they've been able to accomplish and we're optimistic about what could be coming to us next
year.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, thanks. Appreciate the time. I guess, it sounds like most of the growth is going to continue to come
organically from the new hires. I assume that a lot of DC, Atlanta, some of these newer markets. I guess my
question is, any new newer markets for you guys that you might push into with these accelerated hiring plans
and/or with some of the dislocation and weakness in other banks do you think about M&A opportunities, any more
intensely at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

than previously? I think the answer to that is no, we're not. I think as it relates to market extensions and so forth,
Stephen, you've heard us talk about this over a long haul. If you go to Memphis and draw a line up to DC and

down to South Florida, we won't be in all the large urban markets in that triangle there. The obvious void is
Florida.
Florida is attractive to us because it's dominated by those same players I just mentioned in response to Timur's
question. And so anyway, those are attractive markets. We do not, and I think you know this we don't sit up here
and say, okay, we need to find our way to Jacksonville, Florida. We need to find our way to Tampa, Florida, and
set out some initiative to bring that about.
It occurs the same way that all our other recruiting does. Generally, somebody in our organization will turn
somebody up. It says, hey, this group right here, these are my buddies. I've worked with them. They could build
you a big bank. And so, we'll pursue those and see if we find something that's good for them and good for us. We
don't feel like we have to go to do any market extensions to produce outsized growth. We think the current hiring
methodology and the existing footprint will do that. But there's no doubt we do see opportunities and if we find the
right team that could build us a big bank, we'll go next week or next month or next year. If we don't find them,
that's okay too. We don't have to get there. We believe the current recruiting model in the existing footprint is
going to produce outsized growth. So I hope I've hit at what you want. But if I have not, ask again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
No. 100%. That's very helpful, Terry. I appreciate that. And then maybe kind of hopping back to credit. I mean, I
know, Terry, you said you obviously expect some normalization over time. And you guys have been running the
bank successfully for a while and gone through credit cycles. There seems to be a big disconnect between what
people are expecting or what fears there are around credit and what banks are actually seeing. Can you tell us for
you guys what gives you the most confidence that that normalization won't be, catastrophic or what have you or
what some people seem to be expecting on the downside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think the principal thing is how we develop our business. And so, just a quick reminder, what we do is we
target experienced bankers who somebody has seen be successful at that job [ph] over (00:52:59). The average
experience of the people we hire is 26 years. And so, when you're hiring people that have been at it for 26 years,
handling local business for two and a half decades, it does produce rapid growth because generally they handle
that book that well and they could move the book quickly.
But more importantly, it produces outsized asset quality because they leave the bad credits behind because
they're well familiar with what's going on with those credits and so forth. And so, again, my belief is that, that has
accounted for the outstanding credit performance that we've had. And I believe that it will continue to do that. You
know, some people can go back and say, well, Terry, how did you do in the Great Recession? You have outsized
losses.
I think I'd say two things on that Stephen, for whatever is worth, is a little more than yes, but I don't want to
comment on it. When you look at the – if you call the Great Recession, the period from first quarter 2008 to the
fourth quarter of 2012, in that period of time, we lost a little less than 5%. That's a horrible number.
But all our major competitors, the banks that we talked about here, Regions, First Horizon, Bank of America,
SunTrust, at that time, lost anywhere from 2 to 3 times that level. And so it was an outperformance, although it
was a bad number. And so we say, what made it bad? We had just completed two acquisitions immediately prior
to going into the Great Recession. Our natural model didn't produce much in the way of commercial real estate,

but the acquisitions that we made left us with a concentration in residential real estate at the worst possible time
to have one. We don't have that concentration today.
And so the combination of the model and the differences in our company today versus prior cycles are the
principal reasons I feel good about where we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect, helpful. And maybe one just last clarifying question here, you just mentioned consumer real estate, which
you guys don't have a lot of this time around, which is great. But I did notice that you put the reserves up there to
like 1.48% as a percentage of those loans from 1.27%. Harold, was there anything meaningful there that drove
that increase? I think there's recoveries in that portfolio year-to-date, so we're just kind of surprised to see it tick
up there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think the Moody's model is what is driving that increase and the outlook for those borrowers. They may
require that small percentage increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. But nothing specific that you're seeing there right now that gives you any real [indiscernible] (00:55:50)?

Harold R. Carpenter A

anticipate any losses in that book.

Brandon King Q

Hi. So just wanted to get an idea of thoughts on the securities portfolio. I know there was some more restructuring
in the quarter. Just what are your plans there for how that should trend going forward?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we're about where we need to be on securities. We don't have any imminent plans to do any more.
We will probably hold right here and see what happens with intermediate rates here. I think we've gotten the
segments of the securities book that we were looking to get. So we're going to hang on right here and see how it
goes from here.

Brandon King Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think so the type of talent that's available are the biggest category of revenue producers for us is, we use
the term financial advisors, most of the industry calls them relationship managers. But what we're speaking of, our
bankers who control a book of business or book of client and the focus there would be what is wealth
management advisors, small business advisors and middle market advisors.
So that's really where most of that hiring should occur. The other categories of revenue producers, we've been
pretty successful in other wealth advisory and when I say that, I'm speaking about brokers, trust administrators
and so forth. So those are sort secondary categories of revenue producers. But the largest segment is just what
you might think of as an old fashioned relationship manager that handles a large book of banking business.

I think it would be hard for me to say that the talent itself would be at a higher level than the talent that we've
hired. But I would say that we have an expectation that the volume that's available is more than it's been over the
last 12 to 24 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. No, that's fair. That's fair. And then just lastly, Harold, if you could give us a sense of what you're thinking
about as far as the run off of FHLB advances and runoff in brokered deposits and wholesale funding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, FHLB finances, I think, have longer terms. I don't think they will be running off very much here until next
year. Brokered deposits, I think we have some meaningful deposits that are coming up for renewal in the first
quarter of next year, Brandon. And so right now, we intend to just pay those off and rely on our core funding
growth to replace it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And do you know – do you have the amount on hand of what's up for renewal in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it's about $300 million, something like that, $300 million or $400 million. We reduced our wholesale
deposits some this quarter and we intend to do it some in the fourth quarter as well. But I think there's a
meaningful number that comes up in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. On that last point, Harold, on the broker deposits coming up for renewal
next year. Any color on the cost of those deposits as compared to your more recent incremental cost of core
deposits that you could potentially replace that with?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think those deposits were acquired right around the first quarter, right around Silicon Valley and Signature.
I think they were probably in the, call it, the mid-4s, somewhere in that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And how is that compared to the incremental deposit cost for the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, right now, new accounts are coming in at around 3.5% in a weighted average rate. So, there ought to be
some pickup there just based on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, you mentioned earlier about the pressure on the non-interest bearing deposits have slowed quite
a bit. Any other data points you can provide about where you saw maybe later in the quarter or the first few weeks
of this quarter? And then as you talk to customers, what are your expectations for that balance from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We think there's going to be some drift downward, but largely by about the – call it the middle of July, the
end of July, we started seeing stabilization in those numbers every day. So, we've been hanging in there now for
a while. And so, hopefully, that'll continue through the end of the year. We typically get a buildup in balances in
the fourth quarter. So we're keeping our fingers crossed on all that, Matt. So, we may be planning for some
decreases, but we're hopeful we're more flattish going into the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, just to cleanup on the BHG commentary, I think you mentioned some
adjustments that were made, Mark have a building and some software. I think you said the impact was around
$10 million. Did I get that right? And how much has been accrued for so far in the third quarter and how much
could we see in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think they're done with respect to those two issues. They exited their, call it, their [indiscernible]
(01:03:06), which is their merchant financing business. They decided to get out of it. I think that was about a $4
million charge and they wrote down a building for about $6 million. So, that was an accrual where they're putting
that building on the market, hope to sell it here over the next couple of quarters. But for those two situations,
they're done. They feel like they've got adequate reserves in place for those.

And with respect to BHG's repositioning, examples like that, are there anymore items where there could be
additional impairments or events like what we just saw?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think BHG has taken on a much more diligent review of all their product set. I would imagine that going
into 2024, they'll be keenly focused on our core lending products, the securitization network and those two
products, because they spent quite a bit of effort with some ancillary businesses that I think they're looking at,
whether or not they want to continue to invest in.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Catherine Mealor from KBW. Catherine, your line is live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. One follow-up on BHG. I guess maybe just a big picture question on BHG, is how are you thinking
preliminarily about earnings growth in BHG into 2024? It feels like we've got a lot of moving pieces, but it feels like
we've got potentially credit costs improving once you get through the losses in this E and F tranche from the 2021
vintages. But then you've got the impact of CECL and providing at 9%, and maybe a little bit of a softer gain on
sale margin. So, this is an area we could still see stable earnings into next year or potentially could there be
downside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we'll be looking at probably, and I'm not trying to be cute here, a more boring BHG going into 2024.
And I think part of that is because they're going to be focused on their core businesses and less on some of these
ancillary businesses that they've been investing in over time. But you're right, there's a lot of puts and takes here,
but I think their plan is to generate some growth next year into 2024, in spite of whatever headwinds they might
have regarding CECL or where the rate curve is, what have you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And is the difference in the gain-on-sale margin between the placements to banks versus the placements to show
investors? Is that difference large enough to make a big difference in the revenue outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think they will plan on a lot of stronger allocation to the bank network next year. Now, keep in mind, those
spreads are all point-in-time spreads. So, those transactions are occurring every day and that's the spread they
22

Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
flag. The on-balance sheet spreads are a culmination of three years of buildup. So, there's historical spreads built
into that, which were higher two or three years ago than they are today. So, there's a weighted average kind of
process on those spreads. But I do think as far as to your question on new production, they're likely to allocate
more to the bank network where they get to gain-on-sale [ph] tree (01:06:51).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. So, your comment about that being less, that was more of just a fourth quarter comment versus a
strategy into 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think so. I think what they want to do is try to build some inventories going into 2024 and then be in a
position to kind of make sure 2024 comes out where they want it to come out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then, circling back to this conversation of NII growth is it seems like you still have a fairly
positive outlook for just balance sheet growth this year. And typically, you're able to hit EPS growth targets
because you grow revenue so fast. And so, as we think about this next year with revenue growth, still better than
your peers, but probably moderating just given the rate environment we're in. Can you help us think about just the
optionality you have with actually generating positive operating leverage, growing expenses at a slower pace than
your revenue growth as a way to hit EPS targets? Is that something that you feel like you would be able to do in
the scenario where revenue growth comes in lower than expected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we'll have a keener eye on operating leverage going into 2024. I think what we've got to do is
position the firm in a spot to where revenue growth, whatever that number might be, that our expense growth is
within that range. We'll have to sharpen our pencils pretty hard this year to see that that happens. But as it sits
today, that's kind of where we're pre-positioning all the budgeters and the planners that are working, as a matter
of fact, today on how to get a good 2024 plan, as Terry said, that warrants an incentive accrual at 100% of target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Catherine, I think you know this, but just to make sure everybody gives it, the focus of our company has been and
continues to be a top quartile performer in terms of revenue and earnings growth and so EPS growth. And so that
hasn't changed at all. That will continue to be the case. And I think to Harold's point, it's our intent and our belief
that we'll build a plan that does that even in the base of a meaningful pickup to the incentive expense. Because,
as you know, we're currently accruing at 65% and hopeful that we'll be accruing at 100% or north next year. So
anyway, that gives you some sense of what our outlook and belief is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. And I don't mean this to be a loaded question, but just kind of thinking about your peers and think about
EPS growth in this year, you know, we've – most of the street is forecasting through EPS could be down from

most of your peers into next year. And so even if you're at the top quartile and that's flat EPS growth or even
down EPS growth, still better than peers but still flat to down. Is that a scenario that you can still have a full payout
of incentive comp or do you feel like you hold yourself to a higher standard where you might need to still kind of
adjust to that to hit an EPS target that's appropriate for Pinnacle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for that. That's a good question. I think what I would say is if we were to do what you just
described there and just find our way to say, okay, all we got to do is get above 75% of peers. That wouldn't take
much earnings growth and that would be about three years of flat earnings growth, EPS growth for Pinnacle if that
were to be the case. And you can be sure that is not my target. So at any rate – I guess, the technical answer to
your question is that something that could happen, I suppose it could happen, but I don't think you ought to expect
it will happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Harold. I just wanted to follow-up on the deposit costs. I think you said the blended rate is coming on at

Harold R. Carpenter A

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So just based on the commentary, I think you said 10% to 15% is non-interest bearing earlier on the call. So it
implies about like an interest-bearing cost on new money at about 4. Is that accurate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's probably fair. CD's are built into that. So yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, is that I guess on the interest-bearing deposit cost slide, the spot rate, is that how we should expect
that to trend maybe over the next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't think you'll get that. I think new account growth, the volumes are – they're meaningful to us, but they're not
what generates a lot of the bulk of the deposit growth. So the net deposit growth, I think core deposits was $826
million, probably new account growth was maybe half of that, something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right. And also just on the loan side, I think you said you had about $300 million to $400 million coming
due for fixed rate loans next quarter. Is that a fairly consistent level that we should be thinking about on a
quarterly basis through 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I was trying to do the math in my head because I've got about $6 billion coming up for renewal over the
next two years and it's pretty evenly dispersed, weighted more towards the near term. So whatever that number
comes out to be, probably with the CRE renewals you're – yes, probably $750 million, something like that in the
near term in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Okay, cool. And then just on the BHG, I appreciate the commentary and some of the puts and takes there.
You mentioned that they had a building that they were planning on selling that they wrote down. I don't know if
you got this granular with them or not, but do you happen to know kind of what percentage the write-down was?
I'm assuming that that was like an office building or something that they no longer need?

Harold R. Carpenter A

that's what the right [indiscernible] (01:13:57).

Brody Preston Q

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Yes, sir.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Those are all where the other bank is the lead underwriter on the SNCs. We've got about a $1.4 billion in
participations that we've sold, but none of those are in the SNC category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. So the SNC exposure is all, the 7% is just all SNCs, that the other banks are the lead underwriters
on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right. And you know how all that works. In order for them to buy our loans, we got to buy their loans.
There's a lot of reciprocity in this process. And right now, I'm running about $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion in acquired
participations of card SNCs.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Okay. Then I just want to follow up. You know, and this isn't really a follow-up for this call, but I think it's been
asked before, just in terms of long-term view on succession planning. And I think you guys have built a pretty
unique model, which is attractive but also might be challenging for another bank to kind of maintain if they were to
try to buy you guys especially, just given the independent culture that you have. I mean, how do you think about
long-term kind of the growth path for Pinnacle succession planning and maybe partnering with another bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think our board understands and takes seriously its responsibility for succession planning. They review
succession plans, at least on an annual basis. I think our succession planning here would probably resemble
most people's. When I say most people's, most banks' succession planning by first of all, you got to plan on two
axes. What do you do long-term succession and what do you do in the way that our other key members get run
over this afternoon.
So kind of a long-term plan, emergency plan. They have both. I think in the case of the long-term succession
plans, a few they consider really three or four different variables for how you handle succession, of course the one
that most people are interested in is internal candidates. And we have a number of high potential candidates that
we continue to work with and give expanded responsibilities to and so forth to see how they develop and
determine their capabilities over time.
We have candidates that are outside the firm that we have talked to and continue to talk to from time-to-time that
have probably both an interest and a capability to come in and work with us and move the company forward. And
then, of course, we can get in and do considerable range of companies that we could acquire to pick up talent,
and maybe more likely MOEs where there's a like mindedness and suitable talent there. So the board considers
all those variables and I think Brody, I don't know, probably a year ago or more, we talked through some grants
that were issued to ensure that existing management stays in place until succession plans are set. And so my
belief is the board's active and has any number of options for how the succession would work is much like.
I was a basketball player. You know in fast break, you fill all the lanes and hit the open man I think that's really
what the board view is. They'll look at all the options and make the best way when it's time to make one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. I really appreciate that answer, Terry. I guess maybe if I could just sneak one more in for Harold. I forgot to

Harold R. Carpenter A

It's about 80 basis points somewhere in that neighborhood. It didn't change much from the prior quarter. So that's
where we are.

Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Hey, guys. Good morning. I'll make it short here. Just the on the margin outlook, Harold, it sounded though if
we're at the bottom here, the those loans you talked about repricing the fixed rate loans and then just kind of the
hope the outlook on deposits remaining favorably, I guess, should see the margin trend higher as we get into
2024, assuming this higher for longer environment. Is that, in general, how you're thinking about the margin here
in the coming quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think we've got a lot more buyers towards probably a margin that's going to accrete up but feel the same
kind of pressure to run down as we've had over the last couple of quarters, for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay. All right. And then just on the fee income, just as far as the kind of big picture ex the BHG
commentary you've already given, just the – yeah, as far as the growth you're seeing this year, kind of that mid to
high-single-digit rate, does that feel like a sustainable level? I know you talked about the solar piece this quarter
being kind of maybe not one time in nature, but you sounded pretty optimistic about that business going forward
as well. So just trying to think about how fee income looks here, what sustainable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, what we want to make sure is that people understand that it's going to be a choppy line item and it
has been a choppy line item for the last several years. You know, it's kind of a recurring, non-recurring kind of
thing. But we fully intend to support the solar business stuff, and we've got several projects that we're looking at
currently. But the difficulty is trying to forecast when those projects close and when they get the necessary
regulatory approval.
So we're going to continue to invest in that product. Like I said, we've invested in several industry veterans there
that came from some of the large cap franchises. And we like our prospects. So along that, along with our other
equity investments that we've got, we still feel pretty good about the decisions we've made on all those fronts and
what opportunities that they present us.

Okay. So kind of that core – I guess you're calling it kind of the core fee income inclusive of that, those equity
gains. But exclusive of BHG is still, excluding some of the benefits you expect to get from the solar that mid to
high single-digits still feels pretty sustainable as you look forward here, at least in the near term?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
I think that's accurate, Brian.

Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Okay. And then just lastly, on the reserves, I guess is your outlook. I maybe I don't – you Harold or Terry, just with
the normalization in credit, if you do see charge-offs or NPAs tick up a bit here, is there any outlook for a change
in building the reserve? Some given what the outlook looks like, I know fourth quarter still sounds pretty strong,
but just as you get into next year, should we be thinking about seeing some reserve builders, the current level
we're at more likely sustainable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Right now we don't anticipate any big buildup in the reserves starting in the fourth quarter. We've been
looking at the credit pipeline. It seems pretty solid at this point. Who knows what will happen going into 2024? But
right now, we feel pretty comfortable about where we are and what our charge-off experience has been here over
the last few years.
