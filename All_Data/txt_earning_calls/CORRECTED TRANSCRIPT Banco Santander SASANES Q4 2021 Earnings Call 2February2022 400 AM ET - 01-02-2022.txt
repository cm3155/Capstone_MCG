Begoña Morenés
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results
for the Year 2021. Just as a reminder, both the results report and the presentation we'll be following today are
available to you on our website.
I'm joined here today by our Executive Chairman, Mrs. Ana Botín; and our CEO, Mr. José Antonio Álvarez. The
CEO will provide an overall view of the performance of the group, regions and some of the main countries, as well
as the business divisions throughout the year. Our Chairman will provide key highlights of the year as well as the
strategic priorities and key targets going forward for both 2022 and the mid-term.
Following their presentations, we will open the floor for any questions you may have in the Q&A session. With
this, I will hand over to Ms. Botín. Ana, the floor is yours.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much, Begoña, and good morning to everybody. It's great to be with you all and thank you for
joining us. So, as Begoña said and as an introduction to our 2021 results, I would like to provide you with some
context of what we have achieved.
Since 2015, our resilient business model has allowed us to grow, to increase our balance sheet strength, our
profitability, and deliver attractive shareholder returns. Again, key elements continue to be our scale, our
diversification and our customer focus, all of which remain a source of strength, of more predictable and earnings
results through the cycle. In fact, if you look back 20, 25 years, our earnings per share presents the lowest
volatility, the lowest volatility versus our peers and growing results. And this is again a key attractiveness of our
business model.
So, we have laid these foundations to deliver great value to service a growing customer base, which is up 30
million customers since 2015, increasing profits, improving profitability. Our RoTE is up close 170 basis points
since 2015 and, of course, strengthening our capital base in a very significant way, as well as delivering
sustainable returns to our shareholders. Just a couple of numbers on this, we have remunerated shareholders
with €19 billion since 2015, and our tangible now has grown by €12 billion since then.
So, I'm very pleased to report that a strong 2021 takes us very close to meeting our 2019 Investor Day targets in
spite of the pandemia, actually in some cases we're ahead, and we will continue to focus on growth, profitability,
strength, including shareholder remuneration.
We are guiding for 2022 a mid-single-digit revenue growth, cost/income close to 45% and return on tangible
equity above 13%, and we're aiming to keep our CET1 fully loaded at around 12%. We're also aiming to keep the
40% payout in 2022, of which, as we already said, will be 50% share buybacks and the other 50% in cash.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
I also want to say that longer term, we aspire to increase our total shareholder remuneration beyond the 40% to
around 50%, again, through share buybacks and growing our cash dividend whilst maintaining a CET1 of 12%.
This would be, of course, subject to future corporate and regulatory decisions and approvals.
So, if we go to the next slide, you've seen very strong 2021 results. Our net profit is actually up 25% from 2019;
underlying, in a similar percentage, reflect, as I said, the strength and resilience of our business model. We
onboarded 5 million new customers, we are growing revenues by 7% to over €46 billion.
We again increased efficiency and reduced the cost of credit, that's down to just 77 basis points, and generating a
return to shareholders as measured by tangible NAV per share and cash dividend per share of 11%. Importantly,
2021 was a pivotal year for us in terms of capital. We are at the high end of the range, delivering a 12% CET1
fully loaded. And going forward, as I already said, we expect to keep it at these levels of 12%.
So, you can – here's our P&L here. We have been able to recover – actually more than recover our pre-pandemic
levels of customer activity. In terms of the underlying profit before tax, again, it's a record high of €15.3 billion.
Actually, on the quarter is the highest underlying in 12 years, and this is up 21%. Our underlying profit, about €8.7
billion, that's up 80% versus last year, 23% compared to 2019, and again, this reflects optimal cost of risk but also
very strong execution of what I have said many times, is a structural change in our business model.
Very importantly, as you can see, revenues are growing more than cost, with a positive operating leverage. Very
strong capital generation in the year and up to CET1 of 12% even though we had significant regulatory headwinds
this year. Even more important is the strong business momentum, and you can see some examples here. We are
moving our business model to more fees, diversifying into different sources of revenues linked to our customer
focus. These are only some examples.
Loans and deposits are growing, mutual funds are growing at 13%. But in the higher return value-added services,
which are really what's adding to our profitability, our POS, point of sale, up 38%; insurance premiums, up 12%.
Our new Buy Now Pay Later, this is a business we've built on top of our tech stack, Openbank, in Germany, is
going across Europe soon, 2 million customers in the first few months. Debt capital markets, M&A fees up, 16%.
This is really important for the future and these are the businesses in which we're investing more heavily. José
Antonio will give you details later on the regions.
During the year, we also leveraged the diversification and scale of the group. These are two key elements and
we're working more and more in this key strength of our business model. So, our operational performance is
improving across the board, Europe, North America, South America. Our Digital Consumer Bank which, as you
know, combines our Auto and Consumer Finance and Openbank, is one of our important growth initiatives.
In Europe, we are working really hard to transform the business model. Return on tangible is close to 10% as you
can see in the slide. Our customer focus is also showing up in better NPS across the different countries, and
again, the structural changes have led to cost efficiencies of around €200 billion and this is an area we'll continue
to focus on for next year.
North America, we generated a return on tangible equity of close to 25%. We are working also in a structural
basis in the US, I'll give you more details later on, and really trying very hard to leverage the connectivity across
the group, our experience in consumer finance in Europe and Latin America, and other relationships that are
global.

Corporate & Investment Banking also have made great progress. In North America and in Mexico, we are
increasing profitability and being very successful in growing new business like the auto business organically.
South America, again a standout performer, with Chile and Brazil being the best bank in terms of profitability in
their respective markets, and overall returns of 26%.
We're growing double-digit in terms of revenues, growing in terms of market share, and growing customers in very
different segments in all these markets. Our Digital Consumer Bank, again, very strong year, producing a return
on tangible equity of around 15%.
I would like to point to two key numbers in this slide. If you look at the group's customer loans and group
underlying profit, you can see Europe is where we have 60% of our loans and 28% of our profits. Again, this
means our business is more dependent on lending in Europe. This is something we're working on to increase fees
and increase profitability. It also means reduced risk as a lot of these loans are secured on mortgages in countries
like the UK and Spain.
South America, on the contrary, you can see 14% customer loans, 31% underlying profit. This is exactly the
example of very positive operating leverage, very diversified businesses, many of them high-growth fee
businesses linked to digital initiatives like auto platforms, Getnet and other such businesses. Same in North
America, as you can see, 14% of the loans and 29% of the profits.
We have been leading and intend to continue to lead on the responsible banking. And here, we have very specific
targets in terms of our green transition for us and our customers, building a more inclusive society and, of course,
talent and diversity. So, in terms of the green transition, we are working with our customers to help them in that
transition. We are focused on delivering on our own net zero ambition by 2050 which, of course, includes our
customers.
In terms of our own operations, we are already net zero and we are working again on the advisory side on the
capital markets, but also increasingly developing retail and SME products. We originated €61 billion in green
finance in 2019, we have €27 billion under management, and we're the number one bank in Project Finance in
renewable energy. But we are again making a lot of progress in our very important goal of empowering 10 million
individuals by 2025. We're on target to reach that.
We've empowered 7 million people in 2019 and also allocated €500 million in microfinance in 2021. As I said
before, we're very, very focused and proud to have been number one bank in Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index
and number two company worldwide, and this is an area where we'll continue to focus as we think diversity is not
just the right thing, it's also good for business.
So, in summary, responsible banking, we believe, is key to delivering on all our other commitments. We are
creating value for our shareholders. We did set a 40% payout of underlying earnings split in equal parts between
cash, dividends and also buyback programs. We'll be announcing in a couple of weeks the second dividend after
the interim dividend of €1.7 (sic) [€1.7 billion], which was half and half between cash and buybacks. We continue
to believe buybacks are an excellent investment of our capital and so that would be the intention for the second
dividend as well.
So, I will now pass over to José Antonio who's going to review the regions and detailed operating metrics for the
year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ana, and good morning to everyone. As Ana has already commented, we recorded a pretty strong set
of results in 2021 with an underlying profit of €8.7 billion, 78% higher year-on-year in constant euros, driven by a
very positive performance across the board, notably in US, UK, Brazil, and the CIB and Wealth Management
businesses.
Our net operating income, pre-provision profit, was around €25 billion, with an increase of 9% year-on-year, what
I think is remarkable. This was driven by a 7% revenue growth. Net interest income grew 7% on the back of
higher volumes, lower cost of funds, better credit spreads in Latin America and starting some positive impacts
from recent interest rate hikes in some Latin American countries and Poland.
Net fee income rose 8% year-on-year; double-digit growth in corporates, wholesale banking and Wealth
Management & Insurance due to greater commercial and financial activity. Cost increased half of the pace of the
revenue, what has driven significant efficiency improvements. The significant fall in loan loss provision across the
group accelerated in Q4 driven by the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and the very positive
performance of our main portfolios.
If we look one step down in the P&L and we analyze the quarterly trends in core lines, we saw improving trends
across the board on the P&L lines through the year. Q4 was, the profit was the highest of 2021 of €2.3 billion after
a good behavior, particularly on the provisioning side, but also some of the releases were offset for the
contribution to deposit guarantee fund, bank levy, the charge for the Swiss francs in Poland. So, net-net, the
quarter is fairly comparable with the previous ones.
In more detail, sustained customer revenue growth, plus 4% NII and 3% fee income quarter-on-quarter driven by
greater volumes, initial impact following the rate hikes, as I mentioned before, and growth in higher value-added
products and services. Q-on-Q, increasing cost is almost fully explained by bonus adjustments, so this not does
not represent a running rate for the coming year.
In addition, a lower loan loss provision in Q4 favored, therefore, mentioned provisioning release. I will run through
the cost and provisions in more details in the following slides. On the cost side, we have seen significant
inflationary pressure around the world. Group cost rose 4% in constant euros, but were 2% lower in real terms,
absorbing higher IT expenses, digital developments, increased activity and labor agreements that particularly
affected in the second part of the year.
Our efficiency ratio improved to circa 46%. This was basically driven by Europe, minus 5 full percentage points,
which recorded the highest efficiency gains. I should stress that the cost in Spain went down 7%, in Portugal 5%,
and UK also decreased. This is more to come in 2022 and our running rate will decrease in line with our targets
for the region.
We continue to make a structural change to our operating model to drive new improvements in productivity, which
should enable us to maintain cost growth below inflation and further improve our efficiency rate. So, on the credit
quality, the balance sheet remains, I would say, robust. NPL ratio of 3.16%, below 2020 and 2019. Provisions
down 37% in constant euros, partly due to the release in provisions in Q4.
We also reduced significantly cost of credit – it was mentioned already by Ana – to 77 basis points, below 2020
and 2019 levels and exceeds our initial 2021 target. In 2022, we expect to maintain the cost of credit below our

ratio through the cycle. Spain could be key as we expect its cost of credit to reduce to approximately 50 basis
points, offsetting some normalization in the US and UK.
Finally, on capital in 2021, we reached a fully loaded core equity Tier 1 12.12%, thanks to the strong operating
results we delivered quarter-over-quarter. In Q4, we generated 42 basis points organically, a combination of net
profit, net of dividends, and also the efficient risk-weighted asset management that the risk-weighted assets were
flat in the quarter.
Negative impacts in the quarter of 2 basis points due to small regulatory impacts. We already spoke about this in
the previous quarter. 9 basis points due to market movements affecting some ALCO portfolios and 5 basis points
from the minority interest in Mexico. It could include the acquisition of SCUSA that was approved this same week,
was executed this same week [indiscernible] (00:17:51) of 8 basis points, we closed at 31st of January 2022, and
the announced acquisition of the broker-dealer Amherst Pierpont that affect 8 basis points, which is still subject to
completion which will have an impact of 16 basis points, and our pro forma CET1 ratio will stand at 11.96%. We
were able to combine this performance with an increase in the tangible net asset value per share.
Looking at the regions, and starting with Europe, we are accelerating our business transformation. It's where we
are pushing harder in changing our operating model. Profit doubled in the region, reaching €3 billion with higher
profitability due to volumes [indiscernible] (00:18:40) particularly mortgage in line with economic recovery. 24%
net operating income supported by wider jobs in most countries, revenue was up 11%, particularly customer
revenue, while costs were flat due to ongoing efficiency gains. 32% reduction in loan loss provision, and our cost
of credit improved to 140 basis points.
In the following slides, for the sake of clarity, I include the return on tangible equity side adjusted to the 12% core
equity Tier 1 in all the units due to the fact that in order to have a like-for-like comparison between the units and
given the fact that they have very different capital ratios, we are making this adjustment.
So, in Europe, starting with Spain, Spain saw a strong pickup in activity in individuals, mortgages, consumer
lending. Customer funds also reduced significantly last year. Profit nearly doubled, boosted by strong net
operating income performance, jaws of 10 full percentage points. Revenue grew 3% and efficiency gains drove
7% reduction in costs. Loan loss provisions reduced 8% year-on-year, and in 2022, we expect to have our cost of
credit, so, as we expect, a single-digit balance sheet out in 2022.
In UK, we improved fourfold – there's a fourfold increase in profit, basically by record net mortgage lending. You
don't see these in the loan book. That only grows 0.5% due to the fact that we completed the transfer of the CIB
business to the London branch, and this affect some of the loan portfolio went from the ring-fenced bank to the
London branch, plus 22% year-on-year growth in NII due to the deposit repricing and volumes on the mortgage
that I mentioned before.
Cost savings from our transformation program, partially offset by IT investments and regulatory-related programs.
Efficiency improved by nearly 11 full percentage points. Loan loss provision releases reflecting balance sheet
strength. As a result, we achieved double-digit return on tangible equity in the UK.
North America, we improved our competitive position. We've been increasing connectivity in the region,
consolidating IT functions and advancing significantly in the business simplification. We also announced several
transactions in 2021 in line with our strategy to deploy capital in the most profitable business. Volumes grew
driven by our main segments in both countries. Profit doubled driven largely by lower provisions and higher
revenue in the US.

In the US, we had extremely positive 2021 on a like-for-like basis, excluding Puerto Rico and Bluestem portfolio
disposals along with double-digit growth in auto originations. Customer fund increased due to retail deposits with
a significantly lower cost of funding. Underlying profit increased sharply supported by the 11% increase in net
operating income, the NII fees, and auto lease results, and 85% decline in loan loss provisions, in short, strong
performance with US being one of the [ph] genes (00:22:07) of the group in 2021 results.
Mexico, we increased our stake to over 96% due to investing the franchise reflecting positive results and
customer growth. In a challenged environment, rate cuts in 2020, and falling volumes, we were able to quickly
adapt resulting in improving trends during the year. As a result, we delivered 8% increase in profit thanks to the
loan and deposit growth, control cost well below inflation despite IT investments and better cost of credit.
Finally, the region South America, we'll continue to strengthen connectivity. We are market leader across the
region. We are capturing synergies across the region and new business opportunities and boosting our already
profitable franchise. We show strong customer growth in all the countries where we are leader in quality of service
as we measure in NPS.
In terms of results in 2021, we delivered greater volumes in all countries, double-digit customer revenue growth,
increased productivity with costs growing well below inflation and lower cost of credit in all our countries. They
resulted in strong profit and very high return on tangible equity.
In Brazil, another excellent year, record customer attraction, more than 5 million customers with some leading to a
significant growth in loans to individual growing at 22%, consumer finance 12%, and SMEs plus 15%. This
translate into the P&L with a return on tangible equity well above 20%. Double-digit growth in customer revenue
and record annual efficiency levels below 30% for the first time. Maintained credit quality at comfortable levels.
In Chile, our digitalization process allow us to increase significantly our customer attraction, which is reflected in
the plus 23% increase in demand deposits and double-digit fee income growth, widening the gap in NPLs with our
competitors being the market leader. Excellent year-on-year profit performance, NII plus 10%, improved
efficiency, increasing gap to peers, lower cost of credit driven by better than expected performance in SMEs and
corporates.
The Digital Consumer Bank, balance sheet dynamics were solid. New business activity has recovered to the pre-
COVID levels, up 10%, despite the challenges posed by COVID restrictions and the semiconductor shortage. Of
note was auto, plus 13% originations on the back of increase in our market share by 50 basis points across
Europe.
Additionally, we're working on the expansion of Openbank, which performed very well in the year in terms of
customer increase and volumes. Loans grew 48%, customer funds 24%. Total Digital Consumer Bank revenue
was boosted by the new business recovery, particularly fee income and leasing; positive year in credit quality with
further reduction in cost of credit. In summary, excellent results reflecting 16% underlying profit growth, and
increasing profitability return on tangible equity, exceeding 14%.
Going to the two businesses that we report as secondary segments, both have had in the industry a very good
year. The Corporate & Investment Banking revenues grew 10%, sharp improvement in loan loss provision. We
are gaining share and we are on top of the market in project finance, top 3 in project finance in Europe and
LatAm, and as Ana mentioned, focused on the sustainable alternatives and ESG through the green financing. We

are investing in the business, the cost increase as we are investing both in Continental Europe, UK and US to
develop new capabilities to serve our customers.
In Wealth Management & Insurance, excellent business performance in 2021, record commercial flows of €20
billion, €12 billion in private banking and €8 billion in the asset management. Insurance premiums protection
business increased at double digit. Wealth Management & Insurance total contribution to the group increased
12% to €2.3 billion.
Finally, on PagoNxt, well, we made the commitment to grow the revenue 50%. So we achieved the €500 million,
47% year-on-year. In merchant acquiring, Getnet continued to deliver growth increasing the number of active
merchant and total payments volume by 50%. Getnet Brazil recorded significant market share gains. Getnet
Europe started to operating in the second half of the year as a European acquirer following integration of former
Wirecard's technology.
International trade, One Trade currently connects our customers in each Santander Banks exceeding 8,000 active
SMEs and corporates, double in size since March. In summary, we have significant progress in the last 12
months, as PagoNxt, as we invest in world-class technology and recreate the best payments [indiscernible]
(00:27:37) to continue to innovating and launching new products.
And I hand over the floor to Ana to continue with the presentation.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much, José Antonio. So, as I said, we're delivering today, and we're building the Santander of
tomorrow. We believe in an era of digital revolution. This is absolutely essential. And I have to say, first of all, I'm
hugely proud of our team and the progress we have made over the last few years. We have laid the foundations
to deliver great value and service to our growing customer base, which, as I said, was up 30 million since 2015.
We have, at the same time, increased profits. We have improved our profitability, and we have strengthened our
capital base as well as delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.
I am incredibly excited about what lies ahead. We are continuing our journey to become the best open financial
services platform, acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our people, customers, shareholders, and
communities. And this is what is driving our day to day across regions and businesses. In our daily work, actually,
we're not just, of course, meeting our legal and regulatory expectations. Our aspiration is to exceed all our
stakeholders and our people's expectations. This is a key driver to attract the best talent, which, as we know, is at
the basis of success for any company these days.
So, we are focusing on the areas where, as a group, we can have the greatest impact, helping more people and
businesses prosper in a way that is Simple, Personal and Fair. I mentioned earlier our unique business model
delivering more predictable and growing results through the cycle, and this is the case not just over the last few
years but over the last 20, 25 years. We have a diversified geographical footprint, which is well-balanced between
emerging and developed markets. I would like to note especially the contribution of the US to the group's
underlying profit increase from 7% in 2019 to 22% this year.
We are building on a global scale, and this is really what's allowing us to grow revenues but also to expand our
business. One great example you have here is Getnet. Getnet is a global platform now operating in six countries
and our global businesses, insurance, and corporate banking continue to add value with very strong revenue

growth compared to 2019, up 25% for CIB and 12% in Wealth Management & Insurance. These are areas where
we're intending to invest more as they have very high profitability and strong growth.
Importantly and this is a key goal for us across the bank is customer satisfaction. We want customers that love
our products. Our NPS is already at the top 3 in most of our markets and we intend to continue building on that.
Improving customer service but also increasing connectivity, this is one of the, I would say, more difficult but more
successful goals we have set for ourselves over the last few years.
We are continuing to invest in technology to change our business model, increasing the connectivity, not just
sharing but building across the group together, creating a better bank. Where do we see the return on these
investments? I think these are two key facts you have on the screen over the last two years. This is compared to
2019.
Our digital transactions of our core banks have gone from 55% in 2019 to 76% in 2021. Our digital sales again
across the group over total sales from 36% to 54%. And again, I want to stress in many cases now building global
solutions together.
I will comment a bit more later, but PagoNxt aims to me a common tech backbone on payments for all our
customers across the group, as well as for open market. One Santander, we are redefining our own operating
model and I want to give a couple of examples. Our regional Consumer Finance platform in South America, a
single platform for all of the countries in South America.
In Europe, our common app but also other initiatives to develop key products and drive connectivity where we
have horizontal business owners already in place leading for Europe. And in North America where, for example,
technology is already being shared across the US and Mexico, we've saved $100 million over the last couple of
years. Just for 2022, we're aiming for an additional $50 million in this region.
Last but not least, Digital Consumer Bank where we are re-platforming our legacy auto and consumer on top of
our retail banking, native digital Openbank. I want to stress in this vertical, we're going digital, building our own
technology, at the same time, we're maintaining a 14%, 15% return.
I want to now briefly share with you how we're managing our capital allocation and how we're increasing every
year the discipline. We, today, have the tools to manage in a very granular way our capital. You can see here in
2021 that we had 30% of our RWAs below the cost of equity. We're aiming to have 20% in 2022. Of course, these
are businesses where we're investing for the future.
And I want to say that in 2015, that 30% was 60%. So, we've been ruthless in this and the discipline, we intend to
continue to manage in this way going forward. We will allocate more capital as we have done over the last few
years through our most profitable and higher growing geographies, segments and businesses. We're expecting
RWAs to expand at lower rates than loans again in 2022.
We, again, have a target for our front book to not have assets going on the books on average across the bank
below 2.2% in 2022 compared to 1.8%. And we'll continue to actively manage our underperforming portfolios, as I
mentioned. We are also making some accretive investments. Of course, the offers to buy minorities, we've done –
we did Brazil at the end of 2014, we've done Mexico. And Santander Consumer, as José Antonio mentioned, was
actually closed this Monday, two days away – two days ago.

And we also made still pending closing the acquisition of Amherst Pierpont. That's pending regulatory approval,
but this is incredibly accretive to us and the connectivity with our franchises, CIB franchises across Europe and
Americas, is really important. In every case, we – in these acquisitions, we are [audio gap] (00:34:43-00:34:51)
keeping fully loaded at 12% so we can continue to grow in the future, increase shareholder returns going forward.
So, as a summary, strong focus on capital discipline will be key. We have done it in 2021. We aim to deliver
tangible net asset value per share growth, growing cash dividend as profitability improves, and making share
buybacks a meaningful part of our remuneration strategy. We continue to target a 40% payout ratio even though,
in the future, we would aim to increase that to 50%, again subject to a board and to the performance of the bank.
Longer-term, this is the intention. And very importantly, we aim to keep our CET1 at the 12% level, as I
mentioned.
So, how are we going to deliver on these goals? We want to continue to deliver on our business model. We are
working on the increased connectivity. Our three strategic initiatives, which I will mention briefly now – One
Santander, PagoNxt and the Digital Consumer Bank – all of which are providing a distinctive competitive
advantage because we're building a globally recognizable brand that customers trust and value, at the same time
improving profitability.
So, first with One Santander, this is the way we are building first regionally but also from today across the global
footprint shared services. I mentioned the Latin American consumer finance but many others are European
operating hubs. And we're aiming, first and foremost, to improve customer experience but to do that in an efficient
way and in a profitable way.
So, these are the targets for Europe, again, structural change while delivering sustainable profitability. This covers
the four countries – Spain, UK, Portugal and Poland. We are very, very confident that this turnaround, which
you've seen already some of those numbers this year for individuals, the focus will be enhancing digital but
always building on that personal and digital combination. We are working through PagoNxt on delivering for SMEs
a differential services cross-border.
We announced also the €1 billion cost synergies by the end of 2022. We are remaining committed to that.
Obviously, it's going to be a bit more challenging given the inflation environment. We're expecting for 2022 some
tailwinds, so normalizing cost of risk by 2023. And in addition, we'll continue to reallocate capital among not just
segments and countries, but also into more profitable and higher growth businesses.
In North America, we expect to develop and work further on the synergies on the back of that cross-border US-
Mexico but also across the group opportunities. Operational efficiencies will be meaningful. We are now working –
actually, we already have the plans in place. We got the approval yesterday to manage the business in a different
way. I will comment on that in a few minutes. We launched, a few years ago, the US-Mexico Business Corridor.
We're generating very high growth in cross-border customers. Just as an example, total revenue had a 20%
increase year-on-year on this business and we're aiming to continue that growth. The aim for the region would be
around 20% RoTE and an efficiency of 44%.
In the US, and I want to focus on the consumer side, the goal is to simplify the bank and really build a consumer
auto business, leveraging on what we have done in Europe and also in Latin America, but also on the very strong
Santander Consumer franchise and the core deposits in our retail bank. Amherst Pierpont, again, is going to allow
us to deliver for many more customers.

The connectivity is already great around 10%. For example, in our Wealth Management customers in the US
have been referred by our bankers in other geographies and this is a business where we can actually grow much
faster. And in Mexico, again, accelerating growth, improving profitability where we have been investing in
technology together with the US for the last couple of years.
Just a bit more detail on the US and how we are looking at the business, I want to just remind everyone that, for a
few years, we're very much focused on – and, of course, that will continue to be a focus, but now we can focus on
growth and on the management of the business which is aligned to the US peers. So, the Consumer business will
be focused on a consumer model, much like the Digital Consumer Bank is in Europe.
We'll be leveraging on two very key group assets, one is technology and the second one is our OEM and
experience across – and relationships across the world. This year, we delivered 24%. Return on equity actually a
bit above that. For next year, the goal is 19% with efficiency around 43%. This simplification is going to be key.
We're actually exiting some businesses in the US like the home equity and mortgages to really simplify the bank
on what it is we believe we need to support our retail customers and the consumer business.
In terms of the CRE and Multifamily, we're top 10 in the US. Very profitable through the cycle funded by
commercial deposits. CIB, I mentioned already. We see a lot of upside in low-risk customer base businesses
where Amherst Pierpont adds a significant investor institutional customer base, and the leading brand we have in
all of Latin America in high net worth. Again, there's many opportunities here for add-on businesses where we're
investing, and we believe this is going to be one of our drivers of growth. We will, by the way, we are working
sometime in Q2 to have a more detailed meeting with investors on our strategy in the US, giving you more detail
on how it is that we're going to execute in this key market for us.
South America, again, strong growth in customers and revenues. We remain absolutely confident that the region
is a high-growth opportunity, delivering through the cycle. One key aspect is the growth of the middle class in
many of these markets. That is the key to the expanding demand for our services. We are expecting double-digit
growth in Retail. We will consolidate more and more operations across the region in many of the verticals. We
believe there's a lot of value operating as a single bank with its regional approach and building of the connectivity
that I described.
In Corporates, just to give you an example, we're growing by around 25% with the multilatinas. That's a €250
million business today and, of course, with very strong opportunities also with Amherst Pierpont in terms of
access in dollar markets. In Wealth, the connection with our bank in Miami is a key differentiator for us. And in
global businesses, and here I mean cards and payments, again building on the global platforms. And all of that
leading to a regional return on tangible equity of around 25%, and that is in spite of the cyclical currency
depreciation with the current efficiency of around 35%.
So, let me briefly turn to PagoNxt. This is a very strategic initiative. Payments are at the heart of our customers'
banking relationships. It's key for our loyalty strategy. That's not new, it has happened for many years. Now, it's
turning digital and scale becomes crucial. So, again, this is a high-growth, high-profitability business. And I want
to say that, as we build this platform, we're also delivering revenue growth. We're very pleased with the progress
that PagoNxt has made this year. We're investing to integrate all these payment systems to benefit the scale
across the Santander banks but especially customers, but also open market as you can see there in the slide. We
have set ambitious targets for 2022. We grew close to 50% our revenues this year. We're aiming for another 50%
growth in revenues next year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
You can see there our Payments Hub. Again, this is what uniting all our banks with a common tech backbone in
payments. We're aiming to reach 26 million customers this year and to be managing the payments. The legacy
payments will be managed for all our banks eventually here, but about a third of the total payments volume
already in 2022 and more than €3 billion. By the way, these are trillions of transactions if you measure that in
billions. We're going to continue to accelerate the growth here. We're working on integrating the merchant-
acquiring business including with Wirecard and a common platform. We have a very strong e-commerce
proposition. Again, we are aiming to increase our active merchants to 1.6 million, our payments volume to €147
billion and, very importantly, to generate 20% in open market in acquiring.
The international trade, again, we're aiming to grow this in a significant way. This is the way we're going to bring
together our SMEs, the SMEs that trade. These are the higher-growth, higher-profitability usually customers. And
we are also, as you know, with Ebury, we're very happy with the progress and with a 50% revenue growth aimed
for 2022.
Our third strategic pillar, I mentioned several times already, the Digital Consumer Bank. It's operating in 16
European countries. It's being re-platformed as we maintain profitability into the Openbank tech stack. And I want
to say that 2021 has been a very important year. We have set important targets for 2022. As you can see in the
slide, Openbank is the world's largest full-service global digital bank operating in five countries, including in
Argentina now. We launched yesterday.
For 2022, we're expecting to serve close to 2 million customers, but with very strong double-digit growth in certain
products like robo-advisor and customer assets. We're serving more than 65,000 roughly this year and aiming for
85,000 offline and e-commerce merchants with very high growth on customer loans, especially through the Buy
Now Pay Later, which we're aiming to launch in Spain in 2022.
In the auto business, again, where we have not just in Europe but in North America and South America, we're
probably the global leader in this business. We're planning to serve 6.8 million customers with new origination in
leasing and auto growing more than 10% and 25%, and digital sales also doing incredibly well and growing
double digit. For 2022, our RoTE expectation and guidance is 15% with efficiency at 44% and driven by double-
digit customer growth.
So, I just want to end by saying again that, as I started, we have delivered every single year, in many cases,
above our guidance. But very importantly, 2019 and in spite of COVID, we're today ahead of where we were in
2019 in many aspects. On capital, we set a target of 11% to 12%; we're at 12% on a fully loaded basis. On RoTE,
we set 13% to 15%; we're very close to 13% and aim to be above 13% for 2022.
We're guiding to continue revenue growth in the mid-single-digit, €1 billion efficiencies, and that is double what we
said in 2019. If you remember, we said €1 billion efficiencies; we added another €1 billion last year which will be
completed in 2022, and a 45% cost/income for next year. So, very importantly, for shareholders, shareholder
returns, 40% of underlying profit with, again, this is a first for Santander, we believe investing in our own shares is
an excellent choice, and this will be a permanent feature of our shareholder remuneration.
All of that was we we're advancing our green finance objectives. I'm not going to go through these. Obviously, we
can give you more detail, but we are really trying to lead the sector on this. We've provided specific 2030 targets
for our energy portfolio for coal specifically. We're very ambitious in our financial empowerment. We believe, an
inclusive society is crucial and we can really be a leader on this also. And of course, embedding ESG, in general,
in [audio gap] (00:48:48-00:52:25)

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Q
...strain, even including potential M&A in Mexico and some other places? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, let me take the second one, and maybe José Antonio can take the second – the first one on Brazil. So, we
are very satisfied and we have a great business in Mexico. We do not need to buy. We're generating great profits.
We believe that's going to accelerate. We're gaining market share. I actually commented this morning that we've
built from scratch an auto finance business that, in a couple of years, is 10% market share. So, let me be very
clear, we do not need to buy to generate very attractive and profitable growth.
Having said that, Mexico is one of our core markets. And so, when the process is expected to begin and actually
it's months away, we expect to be part of that process. I can assure you, we're generating a lot of capital. We
want to generate more capital and that is one of the goals of all the management team, ensuring that we are
putting business on the books that is profitable and reducing the investing in new businesses, as I said, from 30%
to 20% of our total RWAs.
So, we would do that in a way that is attractive for our shareholders. That's really all I can say if it ends up
happening. If you look back the last couple of years, in some cases, we actually went ahead and did a transaction
in others, and Brazil was a good example. We did not do the deal that was obviously an in-market, co-market
opportunity. So, that is really all I can say at this point.
On the asset quality on Brazil, José Antonio, would you take that, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, sure. As you've seen in the results presentation that we were growing in Brazil, I should say that these two
different splits in the loan book in Brazil. One split on the – I am referring to 2021 in the Consumer side where
we're growing around 20%, particularly grew faster in the first part of the year than the second half, where we
tightened a bit our grade standards and we grew less in the second part of the year.
Going forward, that is on top of these, we were building a significant amount of provisions for the expected loss
taking into account the macro outlook that, as you mentioned in your question, we expect the GDP probably to
grow in 2022. And we are adjusting to the situation and we already feel that we provide for this scenario already.
In 2022, our growth is going to be – what we're seeing right now is relatively low demand on the corporate sector,
and our growth now in the consumer side is going to be at best at the – in line with inflation at best. We should
say inflation is running now at 10%. It's expected to run at the end of the year in the 6%. Probably, you should
expect a high-single digit, but in line with inflation or below inflation and, probably, we're going to grow less than
the market. So, these make us comfortable that, taking into account our provisioning levels, our origination
standards, we're going to be able to managing the slowdown.

So, remember that we face a more difficult situation in 2015 and 2016 when the market was extremely negative.
And although we are not in a position to reduce the cost of risk as we did in 2015 and 2016, we think that we'd be
in a position to probably not to change significantly the cost of risk from what you've seen in the last couple of
quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. I may just add one fact which, I think, is crucial for all of you. And the reason that we're doing so well in
Brazil, of course, we have a great team and there's great execution. But please do not forget that, for South
America and Brazil is 80%, 13% of our loans and 31% of our profits. And the reason for that is we have a lot of
fees and a lot of diversified different income streams that are growing really well. This is crucial aside from the
actual credit management that José Antonio was explaining.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
I forgot to mention that the lending to consumers, now 52% is secure. Yeah. In the past, it was below 40%. Now,
it's 52% secure. That means that is payroll-based lending and mortgage. Yeah. So, these make us more
comfortable vis-à-vis with the scenario you mentioned.

Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question is coming from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And first one, I wanted to ask about your cost to income
target for 2022, if you can please comment on what should drive the improvement in the ratio at the group level?
In particular, how did you see cost inflation in emerging markets and Brazil, in particular, if you think that cost to
income could improve in these markets or not? And also, in developed markets, you admit that the €1 billion cost-
cutting target is challenging, demanding a high level of investments in technology. So, I wonder if you can give
more guidance in terms of costs for the business units. UK in particularly, the restructuring seems a bit slow.
Second question on capital, you can update on the headwinds expected for 2022 in terms of restructuring
charges given and then also the regulatory headwinds that we might expect. And also, relative with capital, a
follow-up on the previous questions, I wonder what is the minimum CET1 that you would be comfortable in
leveraging up if you were to embark on M&A, for example, the Banamex deal. I see that you are guiding for 12%
both in 2022 and in the medium-term, which is an increase versus the previous range. So, I wonder if this is also
your new threshold in terms of capital also in the event of M&A. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Thank you very much. So, let me just give you a high-level view on capital again. So, as I said, 2021 has been a
pivotal year for Santander from a capital perspective. We gave a range of 11% to 12% back in 2019. I want to
stress that, from a regulatory perspective, from a supervisory perspective, from an economic and prudence

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
perspective, the 11% to 12% and the 11.5% gives us ample buffers against our minimums. This is really
important.
We finish at 12.12%, actually fully loaded at 12% if we take account of the inorganic. And I really want to stress
that the 12% is because we understand investors want the 12%, so we are going to be at 12% for 2022
throughout the year. This allows us, as I said, to be very strong from a balance sheet perspective. It allows us to
grow profitably and also to reward our shareholders, increasing as our profits increase.
So, again, the buffer is just to give you a number, 365 bps of our minimums. But also because we have proved
and I gave these numbers, not all banks require the same amount of capital. Business models are different and
more or less volatile. We have proven to be the most resilient bank in the latest EBA stress test with, I think, it's
[ph] 250 (01:00:47), a bit more capital depletion in the adverse. That's [ph] 4.85 (01:00:50) on average for the
banks.
But very importantly, our geographic diversification, Retail, Commercial business, you've seen that in the 2008
crisis, you've seen that in a global pandemia year after year. This is not just the last 10; the last 25, years we have
the lowest EPS volatility. Another evidence, of course, is the fixed income investors which look at our balance
sheet inside and out. We have, I think, the first or second – probably, the second lowest credit cost than any of
our peers. So, again, this is crucial. Having said that, as I said, we are going to be at 12% and 12% is our target
for 2022.
And very importantly and you're seeing that year after year, we're generating more and more capital organically,
increasing our profitability and that's still the intention, I just said, for the medium-term. And we'll give you detail
how we'll get there. We'll be at 15% or actually maybe even above of that. So, this is really, really important.
José Antonio, I think I answered that at least on the higher level which, I think, is something which we care about.
Again, we're listening to you. We're listening to investors. And it's been a pivotal year, and our aim is that this is
not the issue that we need to discuss. We want to focus more on growth and opportunities ahead.
On the cost/income, I think we were reluctant to give many more details. But obviously, we want to give more. I
want to stress that we have said that we are committed to the €1 billion. I'm just saying that it's going to be harder
to do because of inflation, but we're good at this and hopefully our track record...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
We gave you guidance. Your question, as I understood you well, is more related with emerging markets where we
are facing very high inflation both in Brazil and Mexico. Nothing to say about Argentina...

...Argentina and less so in Chile. What we think, given the efficiency levels that we got in this country, is we do not
expect – we already elaborate on Brazil outlook. We do expect not to grow costs on top of revenues. Probably,

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
there's not that much room to go lowering the cost/income in Brazil. We're already below 30%, so we're going to
probably stay at these levels. In Chile, where we are slightly below 40%, 40% continues to be a reference to me.
In Argentina, we have room to improve, clearly. We are still above 50% and medium-term target, and we should
make significant progress towards this to go to the 40% that we deem is the right cost/income ratio for an
emerging market like Argentina. So, this is our view. But the main gains again should come from Europe, yeah?
So, cost in Europe, we have a target. We feel comfortable with our target in Europe, and we're going to continue
to show some gains in costs. And costs in Europe in 2022 should go down in nominal terms.
Now, I already mentioned, Ana is telling me that I mentioned well is, in 2022, we expect a significant, still in Spain,
costs going down 7%, 8% in nominal terms. Portugal, probably more so, probably in the region of double-digit,
minus 10%. And UK, probably in the region of close to mid-single-digits. So, down in Europe. So, this is the big
deal on costs in 2022.
As Ana mentioned before, we are on track to meet our target and our target requires us to be in negative territory
taking into account inflation. In Poland, we may be around flat. Inflation in Poland is pretty high. Salary increases
in Poland are running in the region of 7%, 8%. And taking into account all of these, we expect to be in line with flat
costs in Poland. So, that's the work we are doing in changing our operating model in Europe. That's what One
Europe means, taking advantage of our scale in the four quarters to increase the productivity on the back of a
better operational model.

Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Bernstein Autonomous LLP
Yeah, good morning. I've got three questions, please. Just to confirm on the CET1 ratio, if we included a buyback
element for Q4 and the pending deals, would it be right to say, we'll be at 11.8%? Can you just confirm that the
regulatory headwinds are still expected at around 30 basis points?
The second question is on Spain. Despite a decrease in the customer spread, NII was up. Can you give a bit
more color on that and maybe also on the reduction in insurance fees?
And the third one is on the used operating model. You've commented on some regulatory approvals. Could you
tell us a bit more about that, please? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A

Regulatory approvals, yeah. Regulatory approvals in the US, we got approval for Santander Consumer buybacks,
and we executed that on Monday. We are pending approval for the Amherst Pierpont, which is the other
transaction. That's the only one pending.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
On the CET1, including everything we know until now, would be very close to 12%. I think it's 11.96%, 11.97%.
So, including all the – we were at 12% exactly. At the close of December, we'll be very close to 12%, 11.97%,
11.98%, something like that. It's in the 11.96%, including the pending approvals which will happen in Q1.
In terms of regular – so again, we've said we will be at 12%. As I explained, we have the diversified, very
predictable business model. We've delivered every single year. And there will be some ups and downs every
quarter, but our goal is to be at the end of the year at 12% or above and I'd say every quarter also.
Regulatory headwinds. I think, maybe, José Antonio, you can take that one and the Spain insurance. Regulatory
headwinds, I think have we said anything about that? Do you want to expand. Again, we're going to be at 12%.
We feel very confident on – and they should be leveling off and, of course, a lot less than in 2021. That's for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
On the capital, naturally, there is some potential as always regulatory headwinds coming basically from – some
come from models, difficult assess at this stage. And – but we feel that aside from any kind of inorganic that we
don't have – deals feels that we don't now contemplate at this stage. We're going to be running around 12%
maybe a bit higher, a bit longer than that, yeah, including the regulatory headwinds and probably taking into
account the outlook for interest rate, some impacts coming from the ALCO portfolio, yeah? So, everything based
on our expectations right now. So, this is in CET1.
Insurance. Well, we have insurance businesses, it's running – it's going very well all across the board including
Spain. Spain is growing a lot. What we have had in Spain is some one-off coming from annuities that, while
probably it is not going this is not going to – for sure, it's not going to repeat it in 2022, but I will be surprised if our
fee insurance generation in Spain does not growth in the region of 15% in 2022. So, I'm fairly optimistic about
insurance and I think insurance continues to be one of our best opportunities to grow our fee income.
Finally, the third question, you want to take it, the operating model in the US?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Sure. So, we will give more detail – at some point in Q2, we are planning to do a special on the US, but the
operating model in the US has four business lines. As you can see in one of the slides, one is a consumer
vertical. We're not aiming to compete as a full service bank but rather follow more the digital consumer model in
Europe, i.e., consumer, where we have the 10th largest consumer auto lender in the US. We are going to manage
that as a consumer vertical where we're going to fund with core retail deposits.
This is essential to grow our business in consumer into the prime and near-prime because of cost of funding. In
parallel, we're going to streamline our retail operation. We are planning to exit certain businesses that are not
scalable where we're not competitive and focus on where we are competitive. We're working on a new tech stack
that we believe would allow us to achieve significant synergies.
And that's not just from the management of the business with the consumer which, by the way, we're not able to
do because it was a listed company. And so, you're going to see very much a bank that mirrors US banks where
you have the consumer funded by core deposits, where you have a commercial operation that is based on the
connectivity with our market. I explained in Mexico and others. And finally, the Wealth Management and CIB that I
referred to in my presentation. So that's really the operating model we are working on.

Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question is coming from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is kind of on the payout. I mean you've reached
your 12%, which you've described at length, which is where you want to be. Profits outlook is significantly better
than what consensus is saying is according to your guidance. You're expecting only sort of low single-digit RWA
growth.
Why not 50% payout rate in 2022? Is it because – can we expect some reassessment or a top-up of the buybacks
maybe later in the year, or is there some restructuring charges that we don't know about that might happen, or are
you leaving some room for add-on M&A or just what? It feels like your capital accumulation should be very strong
this year and it feels like there's a disconnect there.
And second, on the US strategy, I realized you're going to give more color presumably in Q2 with the special. But
have you had any more interactions with Chrysler? Realized they bought the in-house financing arm and your
joint venture comes to an end in May next year. Do you have any more color – maybe what part of the revenues
do you think you can keep them and what would be at risk? I mean, in the past, I think José Antonio has
explained that the subprime part is probably something you can keep. I don't know if you can quantify that for us
and how you're going to be able to offset that was the idea. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
...very much. Excellent question. So, on the payout, as we've said, we intend to increase, and we are aiming for
increased profitability, which means that if that happens, and we are confident it will, we would be increasing
dividend per share and buybacks. At the moment, the intention is a 50/50 for next year.
I also said that we aspire to increase total shareholder return beyond the 40% with around 50% of remuneration
through share buybacks. And that is really all we can say at this point. Again, we have profitable growth
opportunities. We think it's interesting for you, the investors, that we do that in an era of increased competition.
We're being very disciplined about where we put our investments. We are getting returns. I mentioned 50%
revenue growth for PagoNxt again next year. And I can tell you also it's going to be EBITDA positive actually next
year. So, that is the goal.
The other very important change, I want to stress this, is the current management is absolutely bent, and the
board is absolutely supportive, and we all believe it's an excellent opportunity to buy back our shares. We are not
going to issue new shares at this price. We're buying back shares. I want to leave that very clear that that is
something we will not do. It was an exception last year because of our retail investors and ECB guidelines. We
want to buy back as many shares as we can within the guidance we've given you.
In terms of the US, Chrysler has indicated that we will continue to be their preferred provider. We've arrived on a
very attractive agreement in Europe with Stellantis as their auto partner. This is a great business. It's a great

sides.

Operator: Our next question is coming from Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. So just a follow-up question on the previous comments, so you
mentioned that you are not going to do any more kind of – you're not going to issue any new shares. Does this
also relate to any potential bid for Banamex in Mexico? So if you could just elaborate on this point. And then also
another follow-up question. So could you just confirm that the regulatory headwind, the capital headwind in 2022
will be around 30 basis points?
And then my final question would be, in the US, we saw 43 basis points of loan loss based in 2021. In the past, I
remember you talking more about 300, 400 basis points was a normalized level. Could you just comment how we
should think about the loan losses in the US going forward? And what you saw through the cycle normalized level
of cost of risk in the US? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So I want to be very clear. We are not contemplating, in any case, to issue new shares for Banamex or whatever.
We are buying back shares. We believe it's an excellent opportunity. It would make no sense for us to be buying
back shares and then to issue new shares. We're not planning. We're not contemplating issuing new shares for
any acquisition at this point at the share price.
We believe, again, it's an excellent investment opportunity. You've seen myself buying every time I can. I mean
I've bought many, many shares. It's a public number so that is very clear. We're not contemplating issuing shares.
In terms of the regulatory, I believe José Antonio mentioned that, less than 30 basis points. It's not 30, it's less
than 30 basis points.
In terms of the US and maybe you can comment on the cost of risk but what's important in the US and, of course,
we are delivering 24% and 19% this year. We are using 12% as the adjusted RoTE across our markets because
US and Mexico, for example, we're expecting very large dividends this year and some next year. Actually, the US
would be managed around 11%, not 12%, and the returns on the US including the cost of risk and everything
else, we are aiming 15% medium term through the cycle which is a very attractive return to our shareholders.
On the cost of risk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. I should say, our business in – you're referring to SCUSA, the cost of risk in 2021 as you've seen in the
presentation was unusually low. We expect some normalization going forward, not coming back to the same
levels in 2022 and even looking in the coming years, our business, we're going to continue to be a preferred

partner for Chrysler for the next couple of years. This is our expectation and we are originating more on the prime
space than in the subprime space.
Naturally, the cost of risk, the second number will depends on the mix because on one side, across the cycle, we
have the subprime space where the cost of risk is in mid- to high-single digit and in the prime space is less than
2%. So, naturally, this is what is going to drive this. On the long run, this will be maintained across the cycle, not
in 2022, where we expect the cost of risk to be still significantly lower than the number you mentioned, the 3%
that we have had in the previous year. So, it's not going to be the case in 2022. And going forward, the mix is
what matters. Probably, we're going to have more prime and less subprime because we are – as Ana mentioned
in the presentation, we are booking in the bank more prime loans.

Operator: Our next question is coming from Benjamin Toms from RBC. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two on the UK, please. Firstly, in terms of customer spread,
we saw that fall slightly in the UK quarter-on-quarter. In relation to your sensitivity guidance for 100 basis points
rate rise in the geography, can you just clarify what you've assumed or talk a bit more about assumptions for
customer spread changes, deposit betas and margin erosion from competition?
And then, secondly, we saw some data released recently in the UK which showed that buyer mortgage demand
was very strong over the Christmas holidays. Can you just clarify what you're assuming for loan growth or
mortgage growth in the UK for this year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
José Antonio, maybe you take those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So, in UK, these two you mentioned the rate rise, we are taking in our assumption some rise in rates, not
as big probably, and our assumption is to go from the current 25 basis points to 75 basis points, maybe a bit
higher. This has two effects. As you rightly said, we expect to make some margin expansion on the liability side.
On the asset side, that means mortgages depends on the competition, you know? The competition drives prices
in the UK. It's a market that is fairly competitive.
And as you mentioned in the second part of your questioning, during Christmas, we have strong demand in
mortgages, and we were keeping our market share. We grew along with the market. We expect to grow along the
year 3%, 4% the mortgage book, very much in line with the market, not losing, now gaining market share.
And the big question mark is competitive pressure in the market. We saw 2021 a good year, the first half of the
year, more competition in the second half. Now, it's fairly stable, yeah. So, that's the situation on the market, and

this is what I can comment to you at this point. Natural rate rises plays in favor of us, so sensitive to the balance
sheet is towards higher rates.

Operator: Our next question is coming from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas Exane. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thanks very much and thanks for the presentation and taking my questions. I have two questions. One is on ESG
commitments. I mean you have given guidance on what is the support that you're planning in terms of lending in
green finance targets. I was wondering whether at any stage the bank is considering to disclose the Scope 3
emissions for the loan book. Just trying to track a bit more on progressing towards that net zero by 2050. And the
other question is a bit more linked to the previous one. At a bank level, if you could just run through a bit of what's
your interest rate sensitivity on the main units of the bank? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. So, let me take both of those, I mean the interest rate sensitivity, actually, we are positioned for higher
rate, so net it should be positive. Sometimes that takes some time to feed through but clearly positive on the ESG
commitments Scope 3. So, we are taking into account Scope 3 as we go through the stress test. We did some of
that already last year. We're doing that this year.
We're actually going to be very focused on embedding that bottom up. But obviously to measure Scope 3, we
need consistent numbers. We need our customers to give you numbers that we can rely on, and we then need to
compare that with others in a way that's comparable. And all of that is going to take some time. So, it's really
important and we are working with regulators and supervisors that we take these stress tests where we are going
to measure the Scope 3 as a learning exercise, so we can have common measurement that we can compare,
much as you do with financial numbers.
We are very involved. I'm personally very involved in the working group, so we can ensure that that happens in a
fair way. Again, the countries – we're not in Africa but, of course, we're in Latin America that are now beginning to
develop and to ensure that we can measure those, what is green and what is acceptable. We need some
common grounds, but, yes, we are measuring that and we will disclose as soon as we believe we can do that in a
way that is comparable across others as soon as possible.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is going back to Banamex. Given that the relative discount
of Santander Group shares, would you consider raising equity using your list of companies in Mexico or minorities
are done? And related to this, have you run preliminary numbers on potential cost synergies in Mexico where you
could buy Banamex?
And my last question is if you can comment on a general outlook on asset quality in Spain and also, more
specifically, what are your plans for your real estate subsidiaries, Merlin, Metrovacesa and the JV with
Blackstone? There's been lots of headlines recently in the papers. Are there any risk of further impairments in this
stake? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, let me take those. I think what's really important is we are not contemplating in any way issuing group shares.
We want to buy back our group shares. It's really too early to say. We are very happy with our organic growth. As
I said before, when the process begin, we do expect to be part of the process, but we are not going to, in any
way, contemplate at these prices group share issuance.
In terms of Banamex numbers, for years, we follow our competitors. We know our competitors' numbers. So, we
do have an understanding. We are not working on that specifically at the moment. It's really too early.
In terms of asset quality, let me just comment on the group and say that normalization through the cycle, cost of
credit we expect to happen in 2023, so 2022 would still be below the cycle. And again, José Antonio gave some
detail already, I believe, on Brazil, which could be one of the areas where there could be some questions.
In terms of our real estate subsidiaries, these are not permanent holdings in any way. We're trying to make sure
we maximize value in terms of when we have to restructure some assets. The goal there is to stay as long as it
makes sense. At some point, obviously, this is not a core business. But for the moment, we don't have any
specific plans there to actually do anything. We believe we can generate value for now.

Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation and taking the questions. Just a first one on Banamex, if you
could give us an idea of how you understand the timeline for that process this year. And then a second question
just on the UK and NII declining in the quarter, and maybe just remind us of how you see the UK NII reacting to
higher rates and the impact that the current expectations for higher rates could have on loan growth, if any?
And then just a final small question, just on the 2021 dividend, I mean, traditionally, you've always announced the
dividend proposal with the results. And I think you said, you'd be announcing the dividend in a few weeks' time,
just curious on that kind of changing in timeline and if you could be more specific on the timing for the
announcement of the final 2021 dividend. Thank you very much.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, again, on Banamex, I think the crucial thing for investors and I am also a significant shareholder, at least at
my level, we're not going to issue shares and the process, we have no idea, but we believe it's going to be long.
We don't think it's going to be for a few months because there's a carve-out involved. They have announced that
they need to put in place a new subsidiary where they would be actually putting the assets they want to keep. So
we don't think that's going to happen for months, probably more Q3, but, again, we are not in – we do not know.
We have not engaged at this point.
In terms of net interest income in the UK, I think José Antonio explained that in sufficient detail. In terms of higher
rates in the UK, would have a positive impact, a significant positive impact in the UK. That was a previous
question. It would be hundreds of millions of a positive impact for 100 basis points parallel rise in the curve.
In terms of the dividend, there is no mystery. I mean we have said what it's going to be effectively without saying.
The reason is that buybacks require a different process from cash. And so that is one of the reasons, but mainly
it's because we like to keep some announcement for our shareholders' meeting. So, I'm a bit surprised at the
questions on this.
We have said it's going to be 40% of underlying income, 50% cash, 50% shares. So, again, I would not like to
give the number, but it's a pretty simple mathematical calculation. So, in a few weeks, we'll be saying that again.
We have a shareholders' meeting coming up, and we'll be calling the shareholders' meeting at the end of
February. That's when we will be giving that.

Mario Ropero Q
Analyst, Bestinver Securities
Hi. Good morning. My first question is on [ph] revenues (01:30:12) in Spain. NII outlook for 2022 is probably hard,
so I just wanted to ask if you think that fee growth will be enough to offset this, and perhaps linked to this, to give
some fee guidance in Spain in 2022. And then the second one is on PagoNxt, well, basically, an update on when
you expect breakeven to be reached. Thank you.

Well, the question of NII in Spain, I should say volumes will be relatively flat, probably will grow a bit both in loans
and revenue – and deposits. The main driver is going to be TLTRO, yeah. So as the TLTRO spikes, as it's – the
negative will come basically from the TLTRO impact in the NII in Spain, yeah.

Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Thank you. First question on capital, can you tell us the expected impact from the EBA regulatory changes on
treatment of minorities, please? And just a clarification, I'm following from Britta's question before, the 12% CET1
ratio fully loaded that you have given pro forma for all inorganic operations is not including the second tranche of
the buyback against 2021 profits? Including it, it would be 11.8%, if I'm correct.
Second question on M&A, if you're not issuing shares, is the 12% CET1 target you're giving a firm target even in
case of a Banamex at the – acquisition? And finally, you announced you're exiting some businesses in the US. If
you could detail for us the profits and risk-weighted assets attached to this. Thank you.

It's not...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
...yet a regulation. It's supposed to come but it's not yet a regulation. In any case, as it is, what we know as of
today, maybe in the region of couple of basis points, maybe 5 basis points, maybe 3 basis points, maybe 4 basis
points in this region. So, it's what we know today, okay, because it's not still translated into, as far as I know, into
a regulation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Right. On capital, again, the pro forma included both acquisitions. One has closed, the other one hasn't. I reiterate
that 12% for 2022 for every quarter, as I said before, the target is to be at 12% for 2022 including every quarter in
2022, including Q1, including buybacks and cash. And, of course, that gets accrued when you actually do it and
the accrual will happen in Q1, most likely.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjie Creelan-Sandford Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Yes, good morning, everyone. I had a question on the Digital Consumer Bank. Just looking at the RoTE and the
cost-to-income guidance for 2022, it's sort of implied that you expect the cost of risk there to remain still relatively
low this year. I just wondered if you could perhaps discuss the trajectory of the cost of risk in the Digital Consumer
business and what you would see as the normalized level.
And also on the Digital Consumer Bank, we talked before about some of the synergies potentially available
between the traditional consumer business and the digital bank. I'm just wondering whether you could confirm
whether you're currently able to use deposits raised in the digital bank to fund business out of the consumer bank
in Europe and – or whether that is seen as still a potential tailwind for the profitability of that business going
forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, yes, we are running those businesses together and so that deposit funding, which is now at €11 billion, is able
to fund the consumer. We're aiming to grow that in a significant way. We've grown customers actually through
Openbank in Germany, Holland, Portugal, outside of Spain around 80% in those markets, and Germany included,
and we believe we can do much more of that. Again, one of the goals is that by managing these customers in a
native cloud – cloud-based platform, it's going to be easier to launch in new markets.
But very importantly, what we've learned in Spain with Openbank is we are very effective at cross-selling and
actually achieving what I don't believe any other digital bank has achieved, which is to have core deposits,
customers that use the bank as the primary bank and, therefore, much lower cost of deposit than other native
digital bank. So that's the opportunity. You haven't seen that yet and we should expect to see that in 2022, 2023.
Cost of risk, normalized cost of risk?

Fernando Gil De Santivanes Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up question, please, on 2022 guidance.
First is on ALCO strategy, is there any big change on the ASCO (sic) [ALCO] strategy that you're including in your
guidance? I feel that the Polish book is still big. This is one question, one part.
The second is on provisions taken on that outlook, RoTE above 13%, are you contemplating any release of the
overlay provisions that you still have pending? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A

So, on the ALCO strategy, we're not anticipating any change there. As I said, we are positioned for higher rates
and 100 basis points parallel shift will have the biggest benefits in the UK but even bigger in the eurozone. Again,
if you take both together, over €1 billion, if you take Europe, the Eurozone and the UK. But again, we don't have

And provisions release for overlay, I don't think we have anything on – in 2022, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Well, we still have some overlay in the balance sheet, as you know, and this, well, may be a deduction, maybe
offset potential credit losses, depending. But we are, as I mentioned, in relation with other questions, very well
provided to offset potential headwinds on the macro side. Well, we are working on this based on – being IFRS in
expected losses, and expected losses naturally depends very – largely on GDP growth. So, we have different
scenarios for different countries, not very unique, I would – I should say in line with IMF.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Right. Yeah, we use IMF and we use the curve. And again, going back to my point early on diversification, there
could be some positives but we believe the positives could be offset by the negatives, and at the end of the day,
the model is going to continue working. So, there should be, in principle, no surprises. Even though you might get
surprises in individual countries, we believe the trends would offset each other.

Operator: Our next question is coming from Pamela Zuluaga from Credit Suisse. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pamela Zuluaga Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse
Hello. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation and for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is
regarding the FX-related mortgages in Poland, how should we think about your exposure to those? We've seen
other banks both actively reaching for out-of-court settlements and increasing their coverage levels amid
unfavorable court decisions. Do you anticipate increasing charges related to the resolution of these mortgages?
And then my second question is basically a follow-up. You had initially guided for an RoTE ranging from 13% to
15%. Now, you're guiding for 13% in 2022. Is this level encompassing any downside risks from the higher than
anticipated costs amid higher inflation like you're highlighting? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
First one and then and then José Antonio on the Swiss francs. So, I believe it's remarkable what the team has
achieved. We – we're achieving close to 13% in 2021 after COVID. So, in 2019, we guided medium-term that's
three, four years, so that's 2022, 2023, to 13% to 15%. We're going to – we're close to 13% now, we're saying
above 13% next year.
Second, very important point again that shows we not just deliver but over-deliver, when we gave the guidance,
we said 11% to 12% CET1. The goal there was 11.5%. We're delivering close to 13% after a pandemia with a lot
more CET1 than what we guided in 2019. So that shows you the strength of our model, the strength of our
strategy and of our execution. We're now saying medium-term – we said 15% but we're still working on what
would be our next three- to four-year plan, which we'll present to you in 2023.
So, I just want to stress that we're not just delivering, we're over-delivering in some aspects. If you consider the
extra capital that we have versus what we were planning for in 2019 and, of course, the pandemia [audio gap]
(01:41:55-01:45:41).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
...this is included in our NII guidance, I mean our guidance for 2022 on the – with expectation we have for rates.
So, that is to go up in Mexico, Brazil, US, UK – not in Europe, but Europe doesn't matter in this regard. That's it.
The second question was...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
[indiscernible] (01:46:01).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Well, in 2023, if I am not wrong, we cover the back – the low side of the range established by Bank of
Spain, so very likely. And this, they have – they already reduced on how – the contributions by a small amount,
€10 million, €15 million, €20 million, no more, but this show you the path going forward.

Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Can we have the last question, please? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our last question is coming from Carlos Cobo Catena from Société Générale. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you for the presentation. I'll try to be quick. One is on organic capital formation. You guided to – so you
explained the 42 basis point formation this quarter. But if I deduct the cash payout dividends and AT1s, I may get
to something more around 20 basis points, so I was wondering what is the difference and whether that delta is
recurrent going forward or not. Is that – includes any sort of securitizations in the group?
And the second question is about Stellantis in Europe. You renegotiated the agreement and I was wondering if
you could give us a little bit more color on what are the expected changes in the business plan going forward or
different business lines, or how that new agreement could affect the business performance. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So, let me just take the second one. On Stellantis, again, we have a very strong relationship in Europe. We've
already agreed a very, very, I think, interesting agreement for both sides which would allow us to grow our
business together over the next few years. Really, that's baked into the numbers that you have. Again, we are
making a strong digital transformation as we deliver every year and we are committed to continue to do that, and
again, Stellantis is a very strong partner of us here and in the US.
In terms of the – just as a general point, I'd say that we are generating more and more capital organically. In 2021,
you had headwinds not just on regulation but also on markets, especially exchange rates and interest rates to
some degree. I think José Antonio showed that in his presentation. I don't know what you want to say about the
future, but...

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2022
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Well, securitization naturally is a tool...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
...with much capital. The guide there is fairly simple. As long as we can release capital, doing securitization with
the implicit cost of equity below the cost of equity, we're going to do that. How much is going to be this? This 2021
was very positive because in granular portfolios like the consumer finance ones, we were able to release capital
at the levels – at 4%, 5%, 6% that are very attractive.
And we continue to check the securitization market. If offered opportunities, we're going to take it. If they don't
offer an opportunity, we will keep more loans in our balance sheet. It's fairly simple, our approach. But naturally,
this is a source of flexibility given the very nature of our portfolio, particularly the consumer finance ones.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chairman, Banco Santander SA
So I think that's it. We tried to answer every question. We very much appreciate your attention. We know this has
been a bit long, but we wanted to give you not just the day to day but also a higher, strategic vision of the
confidence and the optimism actually we have about the business and reiterate again our commitment to continue
profitable growth, also increasing shareholder remuneration as we grow profits.
And we're very – again, our model has once again shown it works and we are, again, very proud of our teams, the
huge work they've done this year, and are confident that they will continue to deliver for you all and for all our
stakeholders in the years ahead. Again, thank you very much. And if anybody has any other questions, our IR
team is at your disposal. Have a great day. Thank you.
