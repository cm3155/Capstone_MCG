Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Cal. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. The first quarter
provides another proof point of our continued focus on growth. I'm extremely proud of the way our team members
set and kept the pace and focus as we pursued and won new business, deepened wallet share, enhanced our
clients experiences, and made ongoing progress in several areas of investment, including Maast, CIB, and
Wholesale Banking.
Our relationship banking approach delivered strong growth this quarter in loans, core transaction deposits, and
core banking fees, and are a product of broad-based success across our lines of business and client segments.
At the same time, we've maintained good expense discipline by leveraging Synovus board initiatives to partially
offset the inflationary expense environment that we have faced, while continuing to invest in talent, and our longer
term initiatives.
The road map that we shared during our Investor Day back in February, strikes the appropriate balance between
core and transformational initiatives. You'll hear during today's call the positive impacts from several initiatives
and investments we've outlined in our strategic plan and progress we are making towards building sustainable top
quartile performance.
We continue to make progress on Synovus Forward with run rate benefits increasing to $125 million as of March
end, and we remain on track to deliver $175 million by year-end. The optimization of our branch network is a

significant initiative within the Synovus Forward program with nine locations closed in the first quarter and
approximately 30 planned for the rest of the year.
We are also continuing to make some promising hires and revenue-producing talent, and new leadership in key
lines and key markets, increasing our wholesale middle market team by 10% this quarter, while also expanding
our specialty lending team, and naming new community banking leadership in our Tampa and Chattanooga
markets.
On the CIB front, our plan to have talent in place by the second quarter remains on track, with 15 to 20 team
members expected by year-end. Additionally, from a digital standpoint, we have continued to successfully migrate
to our Synovus Gateway digital commercial banking platform. Later this month, we'll complete a yearlong
transition of all of our commercial, wholesale and small business clients, providing an enhanced and streamlined
experience. Also, during the first quarter, we launched our mobile virtual commercial card, which will make it even
easier for our clients to utilize their credit facilities.
From a consumer perspective, we heightened the engagement across our digital platform, My Synovus, and
expanded online account opening with increased product availability and expansion of capabilities and channels
and launched phase one of consumer analytics, which is focused on the next-best action for our clients. We also
continued the measured integration of commercial analytics into how we manage credit events and borrower
monitoring, most notably within the community and consumer bank lines of business.
Lastly, development of our banking as a service platform, Maast, is progressing on schedule with the second
quarter pilot planned. We are finalizing the selection process for the ISV, which we will partner with for this phase.
As the platform is being built, we continue to add talent to our team with two new senior leaders added this
quarter, who both have vast experience working with fintechs, integrations, and technology solutions.
We also have signed a definitive agreement to acquire a 60% interest in Qualpay, a provider of cloud-based
platform that combines a payment gateway with robust merchant processing solutions, which will allow merchants
and independent software vendors to easily integrate payments into their software or websites. The completion of
this investment is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including receipt of
necessary regulatory approvals.
Beyond the proposed investment to propel growth in Qualpay's core business, Synovus has chosen to leverage
Qualpay's payment technology stack as an integral part of Maast. We believe this investment will help to speed
up the delivery on Maast, as well as ongoing enhancements and solution expansion.
Now, let's look at slide 3, where we've included key financial highlights for the quarter. I'd like to begin with loans,
which increased $1.1 billion excluding PPP or 11% on an annualized basis. Our Wholesale Banking segment had
another exceptional quarter and we also posted growth in both community and consumer banking client
segments, evidencing the momentum we have across the franchise. Commercial lending continues to be the
driver of overall growth with first quarter funded production up 43% year-over-year. What is important is that we've
achieved this robust growth in a diversified fashion while maintaining our underwriting standards, and adhering to
our disciplined credit framework.
Quality deposit growth continued in the first quarter, driven by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits of $284
million. We continue to see growth in core consumer transaction accounts, resulting from both balanced
augmentation and account growth. Our multiyear journey focused on remixing our deposit base into lower cost,
sticky sources has positioned us well to manage deposit cost in this rising rate environment.

PPNR adjusted for onetime items and excluding PPP fees was $213 million for the first quarter. This represents a
$17 million or 9% increase year-over-year. Revenues increase driven both by balance sheet growth as well as
continued growth in multiple fee income businesses. We would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the recent
geopolitical risk and inflationary economic environment and their potential impacts to our clients, both from a
consumer and commercial perspective.
Increased prices and supply chain bottlenecks are putting additional pressure on liquidity and business activity in
certain segments and may impact margins moving forward. Despite the challenges, our credit outlook remains
positive. Overall, our strong quarter led to an adjusted EPS of $1.08, and operating metrics that demonstrate our
focus on profitable growth.
Jamie will now share a more detailed update on the results for this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. Starting with slide 4, I'd like to begin with loan growth. Total loan balances ended the first
quarter at $40 billion. Excluding PPP balances, loans grew $1.1 billion led by growth in C&I. On an annualized
basis, total loans were up 11%, our third consecutive quarter of annualized double-digit loan growth.
As you can see on slide 5, C&I loans were up $926 million quarter-over-quarter, and CRE loans grew $130
million. Commercial loan growth was broad-based with 10 of 11 wholesale bank businesses growing balances.
We also continue to see growth in commercial production and line utilization. Commercial production increased
43% year-over-year, driven by a 40% increase in C&I. Line utilization increased to 46.1%, up from 42.8% in Q4.
Higher utilization from lines existing at the end of the fourth quarter contributed approximately $200 million to loan
growth in the first quarter. Higher utilization levels are reflective of our clients' investment spend, inventory level
builds, and inflationary pressures related to higher input and labor cost, among other factors.
Regional economic data indicates performance, which outpaces the nation and showed little effects from the
Omicron variant of COVID-19 over the course of the first quarter. Favorable demographic trends continue to give
us a cautiously optimistic outlook on the economic health of our footprint in 2022 relative to the rest of the country.
This perspective is underscored by conversations with clients and other industry participants within our footprint.
As we turn to slide 6, we continue to see positive trends within our deposit base, even as deposit growth has
slowed from the record pace we saw in 2020 and 2021. Our focus remains the same, continuing to deliver
Synovus to our clients in a way that leverages our platform to deepen client relationships. What we saw in the first
quarter was consistent with that aim, with core non-interest bearing deposits up $284 million and savings deposits
growth of $72 million quarter-over-quarter.
Our consumer banking segment with a notable bright spot in that regard with core transaction deposits up $701
million, attributable to a combination of both account growth and balance augmentation. Time deposits declined
by $143 million as a result of our continued focus on remixing our deposit base. Public funds decreased $236
million quarter-over-quarter, mainly a function of seasonality.
Beyond our core portfolio, we also continue to leverage our broker deposit book as a means to efficiently manage
our balance sheet and liquidity position. As we forecasted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we saw a notable
decline in broker deposits, which were down $797 million. That decline was driven by our efforts to efficiently
manage our liquidity position. However, we do expect a return to growth in that portfolio in the coming quarters as

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
we leverage that funding source as a cost efficient means of complementing our core deposit growth and helping
to fund our strong loan growth expectations.
Our average cost of deposits declined 1 basis point in the first quarter to 0.11%. This was driven by deposit mix
optimization and strategic reductions and high cost deposits as previously described. The first rate hike in March
had very little impact on deposit cost, as we were able to limit rate increases across the majority of our products.
We believe the deposit betas will be modest early in the hiking cycle, with an expected beta of approximately 20%
for the first 100 basis points of FOMC hikes. As monetary policy continues to tighten and the FOMC reaches a
more neutral policy rate, we would expect to see increased status and as a result, we're expecting cumulative
betas in the mid-30s through that period.
As shown on slide 7, net interest income was $392 million for the quarter, consistent with the prior quarter. The
first quarter NII was affected by lower PPP fee income as well as the impact of a lower day count. Excluding these
impacts, NII was up $13 million quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, NII was up AUD 36 million excluding PPP
fees. This represents an increase of 10% and was driven by the strong organic growth we saw in the latter half of
2021 and which carried over into the first quarter. The net interest margin was 3%, an increase of 4 basis points
from the fourth quarter. As expected, lower cash balances helped to support NIM and offset the impact of
continued decline in PPP fees.
Looking ahead, we expect to see further NIM expansion in the coming quarters as the benefits of higher rates are
realized. To help further contextualize the impact of rate, we included additional detail on our interest rate asset
sensitivity on slide 8. Balance sheet asset sensitivity benefited from the continued growth in our floating rate loan
portfolios, which increased to 59% of our total loan portfolio at quarter end, a 7% increase year-over-year. This
was due to robust origination of variable rate C&I loans.
Asset sensitivity also benefited from recent increases in short-term interest rate which reduced the number of
loans at their floored interest rate. Several factors offset these benefits to asset sensitivity. The increase in
expectations for short-term interest rates led to an opportunity to lock in the benefits of a rising rate environment.
Accordingly, during the first quarter, we added $1.4 billion in forward starting hedges. We also made a slight
increase to our core deposit beta functions in the first quarter, largely driven by changes in the expected pace of
Fed tightening. So, those were offset somewhat by positive deposit remixing trends.
For purposes of our sensitivity disclosures, we continue to assume a static through the cycle beta in the mid-30s.
Collectively, as shown on slide 8, the combination of these factors resulted in a fairly stable asset sensitivity
position quarter-over-quarter. Specifically, as it relates to deposit betas, we believe it is likely that betas will start
low and increase as the FOMC progresses through this tightening cycle. Both the amount of tightening, and the
pace of tightening are expected to impact deposit betas. To illustrate how the realized beta may impact our NII
profile, we've included a sensitivity table this quarter. As you can see, adjusting the beta 10% results in an
approximate 1.6% change in asset sensitivity.
Slide 9 shows total adjusted non-interest revenue of $107 million, down $9 million from the previous quarter and
down $6 million year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decline is primarily related to the $8 million BOLI gain in
the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-mortgage related fee income increased 12%. Notable items
included an increase in core banking fees of 19% and wealth revenue of 11%.
Growth in core banking fees was attributable to numerous categories, including card revenues and cash
management fees, both reflecting our investments in Treasury and payment solutions. In addition, other core
banking fees such as SBA loans and merchant services improved year-over-year, a result of strong execution in

these business lines. Wealth revenue benefited from strong customer acquisition and growth in assets under
management year-over-year across all of our key wealth business lines.
Within our retail financial advisory business, managed assets grew 24% year-over-year primarily due to strong net
inflows. Synovus Family Office grew their family account by 15% or 21% year-over-year and continue to see
opportunity for growth in the coming quarters. Mortgage revenue of $6 million declined $1 million from the prior
quarter and down $16 million from the prior year. As mortgage rates have increased, refinancing volumes have
declined which has resulted in reduced mortgage revenue.
Slide 10 highlights total adjusted non-interest expense of $279 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter and
up $14 million year-over-year. Adjusted items were led by the onetime gain on sale of our Columbus facilities,
offset by branch-related restructuring charges. The decline in adjusted non-interest expense quarter-over-quarter
is a result of prudent expense management and the normalization of expenses from an unusually high fourth
quarter.
Offsetting the expense normalization was seasonally higher employment taxes and employee benefit costs, which
in total increased approximately $10 million from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, adjusted expenses increased
5%. Over 50% of the increase is attributable to incentives and costs associated with elevated performance. We
continue to benefit from the expense saves and discipline that are part of our culture as a result of our Synovus
Forward initiative. As previously disclosed, we plan to significantly reduce our branch count in 2022. We forecast
that by the end of the year, the run rate expense benefit from 2022 branch reductions will exceed $15 million,
some of which will be reinvested in our digital delivery channel.
Despite tight cost controls, we are investing in the growth initiatives covered at our Investor Day such as CIB,
Maast and Restaurant Services, and we are fulfilling our strategic commitment to add frontline bankers. First
quarter expenditures on new growth initiatives totaled approximately $3 million, and we are forecasting $25 million
to $30 million in spend on new growth initiatives for 2022.
Key credit metrics on slide 11 remain stable overall and at very low levels. The NPA and NPL ratio stayed level at
0.4% and 0.33%, respectively. Total past dues decreased 4 basis points to 0.11%, and the criticized and
classified percentage of loans remained at 2.6%. The net charge-off ratio, which was 0.19% for the quarter,
continued to remain at historically low levels. This quarter, the economic outlook worsened due to heightened
inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions. Because of this, our multi-scenario economic framework assumes a
64% downward bias relative to the third-party baseline scenario, which somewhat lags current conditions.
This increasingly negative economic outlook was more than offset by the strong credit performance of the existing
loan portfolio, as well as the reduced credit risk profile of recent loan growth. This resulted in an ACL coverage
ratio of 1.15%, a decline of 4 basis points from the fourth quarter. While we are excited to deliver strong core loan
growth, our credit team remains diligent in monitoring our loan portfolios and being judicious in approving new
credit risk we take on our balance sheet. As we grow our business, we remain committed to maintaining a well-
diversified, balanced loan portfolio across various industries and asset classes and diligently managing credit risk
within our risk appetite.
As noted on slide 12, the common equity Tier 1 ratio remained relatively stable at 9.47%. Strong PPNR continues
to support organic capital creation with 35 basis points accruing to common equity Tier 1, inclusive of taxes and
the provision. Our focus remains on deploying this capital to our strategic priorities of strong core loan growth and
a competitive common dividend, which now stands at AUD 0.34 per share per quarter. Our capital position
remains strong and we continue to actively manage CET1 within our 9.25% to 9.75% target range.

In the first quarter, we repurchased $10 million in shares. As we outlined at Investor Day in February, our
approach to capital management will continue to prioritize capital deployment that is aimed at supporting client
growth, paying a sustainable common dividend, and accommodating opportunistic non-bank M&A opportunities.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie. I'd now like to share some updates to our guidance for 2022, previously disclosed during fourth
quarter earnings. The updated guidance does not include the impacts of the investment in Qualpay, which we
currently expect to close in the third quarter and will have an overall immaterial impact on our financial
statements.
As a result of the strong loan growth and increased utilization we saw in the first quarter as well as current
pipeline levels, we are raising our loan growth guidance to 6% to 8% for the year. While the probability of a slower
growth environment has increased, it is important to note at this time we have not seen a significant negative
impact on client loan demand attributable to either geopolitical risk or an increasing inflationary economic
environment.
Adjusted revenue is now expected to be 9% to 11% for the year, largely a result of the elevated interest rate
environment as well as strong first quarter loan growth. Embedded in this updated guidance is the forward rate
curve as of March 31, which assumes Fed funds end the year at approximately 2.5%. Adjusted non-interest
expense is expected to be up 3% to 6% for the year. While inflationary pressures certainly play a part in expected
expense levels, the increase in our expense range is driven primarily by growth and performance-based incentive
expectations.
In addition, when looking at expense increases year-over-year, approximately 50% of the forecasted increase is
attributable to investments in growth initiatives, which we expect to drive revenue growth as we look past 2022.
We expect to maintain strong positive operating leverage throughout the year. Our CET1 target range of 9.25% to
9.75% remains the same, and we expect the effective tax rate to be lower for the year than was originally
anticipated, now between 21% and 23%.
Lastly, we remain on track to deliver our previously communicated $175 million of pre-tax Synovus Forward
benefits by the end of this year. Synovus Forward is a combination of balance sheet, new revenue initiatives, and
cost savings, and we continue to generate benefits in each of these categories.
Before we transition to Q&A, I mentioned our team as I opened the call, but now that we provided details on the
financial performance they helped drive during the quarter, I want to once again thank our team members for their
incredible efforts, and for their ongoing passion for making Synovus truly stand out in this crowded and
competitive landscape we operate.
And now, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess I just want to follow up I think a question that came up during the Investor Day around Maast and banking
as a service. So, I heard you Kevin, the Qualpay acquisition or investment is not going to have a meaningful
impact to resolve this here. Now, that you had some more time, I think since Investor Day thinking about the
business, do you want to frame for us what's the size of this opportunity, revenue-wise, earnings-wise, as we think
about it to just give us a sense of what's the optionality that's baked into this and how we should think about it in
terms of the investment thesis on the stock. I would appreciate any color around that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, Ebi, it's a great question. We've spent time since February building out the product. And as I shared in my
remarks earlier, that work has been built around a front-end that is being provided by Qualpay and we have a
back-end processor. Our investment in Qualpay, we felt, was important. We think they have a technology stack
that is superior to what other payment processors are providing. It allows for more streamlined operations, better
reconciliation, and quite frankly, it's much more scalable as we look to add new capabilities to the platform.
So, number one, we're happy with our progress. We're still on track to be able to deliver a pilot product in the
second quarter. We're looking at today three ISVs to be able to conduct that, but we'll start with one. And we'll
pilot that product throughout the remainder of 2022 and we'll have a full rollout in 2023. So, I think it's still
premature to give any big revenue guidance and out-years, because that's what the pilot program is all about, is
to be able to garner what sort of transactions we'll get from a payment platform, the depository impact.
And then, as you recall, phase two of the program was to add a fully embedded finance program where we would
have lending capabilities. But I would tell you since that February date, we remain very confident in our ability to
develop the product, but more importantly, we continue to receive good feedback from those ISVs that this sort of
product would be something that they would want to use. So, there's nothing that's changed. We do think it can

be a meaningful impact. And although Qualpay is immaterial from a financial standpoint, we think it can be
material as we use that company to build out the Maast product.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, Kevin. I guess, maybe later in the year, maybe better timing to get more clarity here. And one
question for Jamie I think, looking at slide 17, where you have your derivative hedging portfolio, just talk to us
around strategy around managing asset sensitivity, if we do get all the rate hikes that are baked into the forward
curve. How do you think about neutralizing the balance sheet and defending against the risk of lower rates down
the road?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim, as we think about our hedging strategy, you can see that we added $1.4 billion in hedges in the
first quarter. And the thought process there is, basically, we looked at our asset sensitivity, it was increasing. And
it's increasing for a couple of reasons. First, the percentage of our loans that are floating rate continues to
increase due to the growth and commercial C&I lending, and that will continue going forward. So, our balance
sheet is negatively asset-sensitive, and it'll continue to get even more assets as we move forward.
But then you also had the impact of the first rate hike moving loans off their floors, which was another incremental
increase in asset sensitivity. And so, we basically looked at our sensitivity and managed it through receiving fixed
with forward starting derivatives. And you can think about these as receiving fixed just to shade more than 2%
that we believe that is prudent. If you get 8 rate hikes from here or so, you're fairly close to breakeven on this and
it's good for us to go ahead and lock in that benefit for that higher rate environment.
And so, we will continue to manage our asset sensitivity. We believe that the forward curve is actually a fairly
likely scenario at this point, given Fed rhetoric, but we will continue to manage that going forward consistent with
what you've seen in the past.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
I noticed you didn't give any guidance on your future net charge-offs or credit costs. I wonder how you're thinking
about that in the next few quarters and how you're – what you're seeing from client sentiment right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Jennifer. It's Bob. Thank you for the question. And there's no doubt these metrics continue to be really good
in terms of credit and specifically to your point charge-offs. But I think we're kind of range-bound right now. If you
look at it over the last several quarters, it's been in that 20 basis point, 25 basis point range. In the intermediate
term, I would certainly not – we don't see anything that's materially affecting our outlook, at least generally
speaking, through the remainder of this year.
Longer term, there will be some normalization. And I know that's a question of how you define that, but our credit
cost can't get much lower. So, naturally, there would be some incremental rise over time. But to Jamie's point
earlier, the way we're reserving in – our incremental allowance build that would begin to associate with a growing
loan portfolio, continued downward bias on the economics will keep us a little elevated there. So, from a guidance
perspective, I feel like we're kind of in a net range at least for the foreseeable future.

couple. If you think about a weakening consumer as a result of the inflation factors and the rising rate, certainly
those industries that have dependency on discretionary spending, we're watching very closely. The way I think
about it is, I go back to COVID when demand really just fell off the table and we looked at our hotel portfolio,
restaurant portfolio, arts, entertainment. So, I think those industries are still relatively the ones you would want to
watch during a slowing consumer demand.
And I think at least from our perspective, we really got very diligent in those portfolios. We brought in our use of
analytics, which is now built into our sort of business-as-usual platform of underwriting. We look at real-time cash
inflows as we showed you all during the pandemic, I think that continues. So, anything consumer related certainly
is on my radar on the commercial portfolio side, specifically C&I. Small businesses would be something we would
watch.
And for us, that portfolio is $1 billion, $1.5 billion, give or take, depending on how you define it. But those
customers today continue to be able to pass along increasing cost. I think over time, they don't have the leverage
that their larger counterparts have relative to input cost and supplier negotiations. So, we can certainly see some
margin squeeze there and certainly top line decline. So, small business is one that's coming out. The good news
for our portfolio is over half of that is secured by real estate of some type, now which gives us a little comfort in
the loss-given default scenario, but those would be the ones I would call out.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Steven, please go ahead.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start, how are you guys thinking about deposit growth in 2022 and what's assumed in the 2022 revenue
outlook that you're providing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Steven, I'll start. It's Kevin on the deposit outlook. As you've seen in the last year, we've taken our strong
liquidity position to continuously remix the book, bringing down higher cost CDs, bringing down some of our
brokered funds. And as we sit here today at an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio, we'll continue to strategically remix
where it makes sense, where we can bring in the lower cost, sticky deposits. We've increased the percentage of
total deposits being non-interest-bearing up to 34% this past quarter. And so, our strategy going forward would be
that those categories that fall under our core transaction deposits will be the area that we continue to focus.
We think that those categories should grow in line with our client growth, which should be in that 3% to 5% range
as we're thinking about continuing to take the growth that the economy gives us, but also taking share from some
of our competitors. And so, if you look at year-over-year, core transaction deposits are actually up 10%. So,
looking at the rest of the year, I think you would see that 3% to 5% deposit growth, it would obviously be far less
than what we've seen in previous years.
As it relates to revenue growth for the rest of the year, I'll let Jaime touch on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I'll jump in a little bit more on the deposit side as well, because we will use broker deposits to fund the
incremental loan growth as we go through the year, Steve. And so, you may see some rebuild of that portfolio,
which will be incremental to our core transaction deposit growth that Kevin just kind of just walked through.
On the revenue guide, we increased our guide to 9% to 11%. We feel good about the growth outlook. But largely,
what you see in that revenue guide increase is, one, an acknowledgment of the strong performance on the loan
side in the first quarter, but also the change in the interest rate outlook. And so, embedded in that is our
assumption of deposit betas remaining somewhat lower for the first few hikes. We're assuming an approximate

20% beta for the first four hikes, and then betas increasing as you go beyond that. But that's really the source for
the revenue guide update, the 9% to 11%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, the second question on Qualpay, could you go into a bit more detail on the
functionality this provides to you? And what was the thought of acquiring – I think it was 60% or somewhere
around there. What was the thought of acquiring the stake in the company? What additional benefits will that
provide to you? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, they're an ISO, Steven, so today they provide merchant processing for third parties. And so, we have been
the sponsor bank, the acquiring bank for them for some time, so we've known them. We think that their
technology stack differentiates them in the payment space. And so, acquiring 60% of the company allows us to
help set priorities for their core business which will continue to be merchant-acquiring business, but leveraging
their development team, their technology stack to fully embed into our payments platform that will be Maast. So,
they will be the front end to our program.
So, as we sell merchant processing to these software vendors, they will be using the Qualpay platform that will be
brought to them by Synovus. And so, number one, it helps us get the product out there more quickly. And then,
two, as we're looking at expanding the Maast program over time, whether it's through new reporting, new
products, having that ownership interest allows us to direct investment in capital into the company to allow us to
develop new capabilities.

Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Jamie or Kevin, maybe I wonder to start with the margin. Just kind of curious if you guys could comment on
commercial loan yields. Do you think that you sort of reached a floor there, exclusive of the rate changes we've
seen and may continue to see, just kind of curious what our starting point might be in terms of kind of where your
commercial book can start to reprice up from? Just wanted to hear kind of what you're hearing in terms of if those
yields have started to bottom out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brad, it's a good question. And we did see the weighted average rate increase quite a bit in first quarter
relative to where we were back in fourth quarter up actually 40 basis points on the rate front. So, we do believe –
it's still below the portfolio yield. But I do think to your point, we've kind of hit bottom and we'll continue to
produced new loans at or near where the portfolio rate is, which will allow us to start to expand the margin. And I
don't think that price competition is going away. I just think credit spreads widened a bit, and the environment has
gotten to a position with the rate increase where we can actually put on loans that will be at or near where the
overall portfolio rate is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Very helpful. And just as my follow up, Jamie, can you kind of talk about the moving parts in the balance
sheet, maybe to the size of it. It look like the bond portfolio, at least on a period end basis, was down some
obviously cash to runoff those index or brokered money that you had. Do you still feel good about 3 basis points
for each rate hike with kind of all the moving parts? That seems somewhat conservative but just want to see if you
could add some color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We still think that in the early hikes, they're using 3 basis points to 4 basis points per Fed move is
appropriate with the beta assumptions I mentioned earlier. And so, we do feel good about that. As you get further
along, and maybe pass the first 100 basis points, you could see betas increase and you could see that that
margin benefit decreased a little bit. A little more color, though, on that sensitivity is that about 60% of our asset
sensitivity is to the front end of the curve, and so, the 3 basis points to 4 basis points is really just that front-end
impact. And so, there is a fairly significant impact by the back end of the curve. And in that commentary of 3 basis
points to 4 basis points, I'm not really assuming a change in loan rates.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I just wanted to ask on the C&I growth, it's been obviously particularly strong in this quarter. You finally sort of saw
a big uptick in your utilization rates. And based on the chart you've put in the deck, it looks like we're back to 4Q
2019 levels. So, understanding that some of the revised guidance is due to this quarter's strength, but you also
mentioned the pipeline, I guess, should we expect this 46% to kind of hold or is there room for it to expand? And I
guess, if there isn't room for it to expand, what are kind of some of the key drivers of what you expect to be strong
C&I growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Brody, I'll take that. As you saw, 300 basis point increase in utilization this quarter to 46%, so that created
about $500 million of growth, but I think it's important to dissect that $500 million. When you go back and look at
the lines that were on the books the previous quarter, the increased draws from those existing lines contributed
only $200 million, a little less than $200 million of that $500 million. So, about $300 million of the growth in line
utilization came from new commitments and draws that we put on this past quarter.
Now to the question of where is the line utilization going? Although, 46% is where we were pre-pandemic, we've
touched the line of 50% in the past. And when you think about the inflationary environment that we're under, as
well as the portfolio mix, we're growing our Wholesale Banking lines of credit at a faster pace, which typically
carry a higher utilization rate. We believe that we could see utilization in the 50% range. And so, if you took that
off of today's commitment, that could contribute another $500 million worth of growth, if that were to play out.
Now, we haven't included that in our 6% to 8% loan growth projections, but we think that there's a likelihood that
we could see continued line utilization increases.
The other thing I would just point out on C&I, as you noted, of the growth this quarter, $926 million, we had 13
industry classifications show growth and 8 sub lines of business produce growth. So, I think about it. It wasn't just
a utilization story. It was broad-based. It was very diversified across many of our businesses and across many
industries and that pipeline that you referenced, our pipelines are up about 30% from where they were closing out
2021. So, we remain confident that the production engine will continue in the second quarter and it's not based on
the line utilization continuing to go up.

Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, the last one was just on the – I appreciate all the interest rate
disclosures within the deck. What I wanted to ask – it's a two-part question, but it's on the loan yield side. Jamie,
how are you thinking about, I guess, maybe, you look at the floating rate portfolio. Obviously, it's got the floors, but
how are you guys thinking about maybe any attrition in the benefit that you would see from floating rate loans in
your go-forward modeling in terms of floating rate loans converting to fixed loans over time, maybe losing some of
those from a mix perspective? Is any of that factored into your go-forward NII sensitivity?
And then secondly, I noticed a big uptick in SOFR-based loans, so, I guess I wanted to ask you, SOFR is acting
much more like the prime rate than it is LIBOR, at least in the market. So, as you think about kind of floating rate
loans going forward, is there any benefit to pricing it on SOFR versus pricing it off of prime?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Brody, good question. As we think about the loan mix and the impact to the margin, a lot of our – as you're
well aware when you look at our fee revenue, a lot of our floating rate loans, our clients choose to swap them, and
they hedge those loan exposures, and then we kind of pass that through. But we're not assuming any material
mix change around fixed float outside of the growth of floating rate lending just in aggregate, just given the areas
of our businesses that we're growing. So, we do expect to continue to increase as far as the percentage of loans
that are floating rate versus fixed. But we're not assuming any mixes within the portfolio at the moment.
And then on the SOFR, as we think about the spread impact of SOFR versus LIBOR, it is uncertain. But we kind
of look at that as a push, because we think that we're giving our clients basically that spread difference on the
spread. And so, it ends up being a net push between where we think it would have been with a more credit-based
index like LIBOR was.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
And I'd just add, Jamie, we also – you asked versus prime, we use prime on small business loans. We're kind of
following the industry in terms of what is market and the larger loans, the Wholesale Banking loans are moving
more on the SOFR platform. So, we're trying to keep consistent with what the industry is providing in terms of
pricing terms and indices.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start on the share buyback. There wasn't a lot of buybacks in the quarter, which makes sense and
your loan growth was pretty robust and you had some capital impact from AOCI. But with the growth profile
looking better now, should we expect kind of a minimal amount of activity from the buyback this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think the first quarter is a good example of our strategy around capital management and leveraging share
buybacks as kind of the last in line for capital management. And so, when we look at the rest of the year, loan
growth clearly was very strong in the first quarter and that's where we deployed the capital generated through
core earnings.
As we go through the year, if loan growth were to continue at the same pace, then you would expect to see very
minimal share repurchases, but we will use those kind of as the toggle. We believe the 9.5% common equity Tier
1 is the right place to be in this environment with this uncertainty. But you're right to assume that it likely will
assume lower amount of share repurchases than either prior year or lower [indiscernible] (00:48:57).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Right. And then your intra-quarter we saw, one, you have Southeast banking peers in Tennessee sell to out-of-
country buyer, but mostly a consumer bank, is that an opportunity for Synovus whether it's maybe hiring some
new talent or taking some customer market share?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Obviously, Brady, anytime there's disruption in the marketplace, we think it presents an opportunity for us, and as
you know that that competitor does have overlap with Synovus. I think there were some unique elements to that
transaction where there were some incentives paid up-front for retention. And so, there may be a different tale as
it relates to being able to attract some of the talent. But broadly, any time that we see anyone going through a
major conversion or having a headquarter moved out of the Southeast, we look at that as an opportunity.
As I've shared with you in the past, you have to take it almost as a process. There are going to be opportunities
the day it's announced, there're going to be opportunities when the management team switches out and there're
going to be opportunities when there's a actual migration that's going on. And so, we'll have to be smart in each of
those elements to make sure that Synovus is planting seeds for both talent and clients to be the destination of
choice, if they decide they want to move banking relationships. And so, we'll go at that process similar to how
we've done some of the other mergers that have happened in our footprint.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Maybe just following up on that, you gave some great long-term goals when we were all down there in
February that were based on unchanged utilization rate. And as you look at the strength of customer demand and
then also the First Horizon opportunity, how does that impact that long-term goal? Is it a meaningful opportunity to
maybe move that higher or you're sort of expecting some of these things in the background?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
As we think about our multiyear goals, it's hard to react to just like couple of months of new data. We clearly
believe in the southeast. We believe that the opportunity that's in front of us is real. And it's something that we
capitalize on every day, every day when we come into the office. And so, we are excited about what's in front of
us. We think that if you look at Q3, Q4, Q1, those are just data points of us capitalizing on the opportunity we
expect to continue. We don't have anything new to say about the longer term outlook and multiyear objectives, but
we see what's in front of us. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of it, and that's where
we're focused on doing.

Jared Shaw Q

Okay. Thanks. And then, just a follow up on the margin benefit from higher rates. You said 60% of that is front-
end loaded. I guess, since February, we're seeing the 10-year up about 100 basis points. If we keep the 10-year
near this level, could that be an additional, call it, 2 basis points to 3 basis points benefit to margin or do you
expect it to be higher from here to get that benefit?

Well, when you look at the – if you think about where that sensitivity lies, it lies in our fixed rate assets on the
balance sheet in both securities portfolio and mortgages. And we did see premium amortization come down in the
first quarter, but I do believe that it could come down further even if mortgage rates stay where they are today.
And so, you could see a little bit of a tailwind in the long end with where rates are today, but it's not as significant
that it would be if we had a further rate increase on the long end.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, a question for you. I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, but how have new
loan rates changed in the last 30, 45 days? Have you seen any movement? And is the next Fed move really
going to be the change to engage those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We have seen an increase and Kevin did mention this a little bit earlier, but first quarter, we did see an increase of
about 40 basis points from the prior quarter. And so, we are seeing a benefit and it's coming through in a couple
of ways. It's coming through in new loan origination, but you're also seeing loans come off of their floors and so
that you can see that in our asset sensitivity table. But we're getting the benefit now of loans that were floored
kind of now they're not floored anymore. And so, every rate move impacts them. And so, we are benefiting from
that. We still have floored loans, but each move reduces that amount. And that's what you've seen kind of come
through in the first quarter and we expect that to continue as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. That's helpful. Just want to reinforce that. Thanks. And then, on the hedge strategy, does that limit the risk
on the AOCI side at all? I know some of it is avoidable, just curious if that hedging strategy tampers AOCI impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It does not. And you could argue that it exacerbates the AOCI component of that, because the market does flow
through on that. But I do want to speak to AOCI and the impact of tangible, because we intentionally take duration
risks in our securities portfolio and our hedge portfolio. And you're well aware of our strategies there, both the
securities book as well as the hedge portfolio are offsets to our asset sensitivity. And so, we benefit when rates
rise. This is a partial offset to that.
But when we think about valuation and enterprise value, in a higher rate environment our enterprise value
increases. Now, when you look solely at AOCI and the valuation securities book and the hedge book, those go
down. But that's just a partial offset to what happens to the company as a whole. And so, when we think about

tangible book value, we think about AOCI is basically a temporary disconnect where you have an immediate
reaction to the market value of these assets. But that goes away over time as the assets mature.
And so, we believe in tangible book value growth. We think that that's an important shareholder value creator. But
when we look at AOCI and that impact, we view that as basically a temporary disconnect. And so, that's kind of
our holistic thought process around the impact of AOCI and how that flows through.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Most of my questions have been asked and answered, just a few quick ones. Within the revenue guide, can you
speak a little bit about how you're thinking about fee revenues, so if you think about the run rate what we saw this
quarter, and I know we saw capital markets and mortgage declining, just generally, how to think about that run
rate going forward within that guidance? Thanks.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Kevin. It's actually a really good question because there's lots of assumptions that go into the rest of the
year. But we believe that, for the year, NIR to be down around 5%. And so that would mean that for the rest of the
year, you would see a fairly flat NIR quarterly number, and there's again some puts and takes. On the positive
side, we feel very good about the ongoing growth of core banking fees, whether it's on the treasury and payment
solution side, or continuing to return to pre-pandemic levels with card spend and service charges. So, that should
continue to provide a tailwind for us.
Maybe the biggest uncertainty going forward is on the wealth side, where we're putting up a little less than $40
million a quarter, depending on what the market does, that will have a big impact on what our fees do. We
continue to have the opportunity to grow our assets under management. As Jamie mentioned in his remarks,
we've seen good client acquisition growth. But when you see the type of volatility in the market and this potentially
having a bear market, it makes us a little less certain on what those future quarters are going to look like.
And then you look at mortgage, we think we've kind of hit a stable mortgage number for the quarter and we think
that will continue as we look into the future just based on volumes and margins. And so, when you add up the
things that we know that are growing along with mortgage, which is fairly stable, the real wild card will be what
happens with wealth. And if we see a constructive equity market, I think we could have some upside on the fee
income component.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Kevin. And one quick final question for me is, on the Qualpay move and I understand the logic and
the rationale for it but, what does that replace? In other words, if you didn't make the investment in Qualpay, what
would have – did you have this functionality that was already going to be in place that this is kind of superseding?
I'm just wondering what the plan would have been without Qualpay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well. So, early on, Kevin, we evaluated lots of vendors to utilize for the build, and which we selected Qualpay. So,
Qualpay was already engaged in building out the Maast platform. This is nothing more than making an investment
in the company to ensure that we can continue to provide the capital that will allow the company to meet today's
needs, but ultimately the future needs as we grow this product. So, they were going to be our partner either way.
This just gives us an ownership interest in the company to be able to help, shape and drive capital into the growth
of the program.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. Great. Very clear. Thanks, Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
Kevin Blair for any closing remarks. Thank you.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Thank you, Emily, and thanks, everyone, for attending this morning, and your continued interest in Synovus. Just
a few things I'll mention before we close out today's call. We were proud to recently be chosen again as the top
workplace or one of the top workplaces in the Atlanta market by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The relevance of
this sort of recognition in one of our biggest markets, our fastest growth market is truly significant, especially given
our efforts to continue to recruit, and retain some of the best and brightest talent in the industry.
Also, it seems like it's been a very long time, but we are transitioning our team member base back to being fully
onsite in our workplace in the coming weeks. Now, we will remain flexible, as COVID trends continue to ebb and
flow and ultimately, we'll have the majority of our organization back onsite, but we have defined roles that we'll be
able to maintain for remote capabilities and also some hybrid work schedules. I just think that's the future of work.
We also continue to advance our ESG investments and initiatives, especially as we monitor the progress of the
proposed SEC rules for climate disclosures beginning as early as next year. We've already completed our Scope
1 and 2 GHG baseline assessments, and we'll continue to evaluate for future carbon reductions like our branch
consolidation efforts.
We continue to deliver on the expectations that we set for ourselves, and I think it's been a year of acceleration
and achievement, although we're just through one quarter. Our focus is very clear. It's on execution and
continuing to meet our short-term objectives while expanding and extending our solutions to better meet client
needs and to deliver sustainable, top-quartile performance.
I truly look forward to the next time we're together to share our progress, but for now, I hope everyone has a
wonderful day. And, operator, we'll close out our call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you very much. This concludes our call. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. You may
now disconnect your lines.
