of these accomplishments.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
On July 17, we entered into an agreement to sell our private student loan portfolio to affiliates and limited partners
of Carlyle and KKR. Firstmark, a division of Nelnet, will assume responsibility for servicing the portfolio upon sale.
This agreement represents an important milestone in our journey to simplify our operations and business mix. The
completion of the sale also has financial implications, which John Greene will detail in a few moments.
As we continue to resolve past issues and strengthen our risk management and compliance posture, we have
entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the merchant class action associated with the card
misclassification litigation, subject to court approval. The decision to settle was based upon our internal reviews,
extensive dialogue with key constituencies, including merchants and regulators, and our pending merger with
Capital One.
The settlement agreement would resolve claims by parties affected by the card misclassification, including
merchants, acquirers and intermediaries. Our current remediation reserve is sufficient to cover the expenses
under the terms of the settlement agreement. Our results also benefited from a litigation settlement in our
Payment Services segment, where Discover was the plaintiff. We're happy to have this matter resolved and are
satisfied with the favorable financial outcome.
Finally, turning to our pending merger with Capital One, Capital One continues to lead the integration planning
process and the teams are working well together on integration planning and regulatory applications. Upcoming
merger-related milestones include a virtual public hearing hosted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, the
completion of the written comment period, and in-person public hearing with the Delaware State Bank
Commissioner, and the filing of the definitive merger proxy. We expect shareholder votes to occur this fall. We are
encouraged by how the merger planning and application processes are progressing and continue to believe that
the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling.
With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our second quarter 2024 financial results.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on slide 5. In the
quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion, which was up 70% from the prior year quarter. Our fundamental
performance in the period was driven by revenue expansion from loan growth, higher net interest margin and non-
interest revenue growth.
Credit continues to perform in line with expectations, supporting our view that losses are near peak and will
plateau during the second half of 2024. There are several unusual items which impacted the quarter. These
included a $869 million student loan reserve release, a gain of $26 million from the sale of our Lake Park facility,
and largely offsetting one another were the favorable litigation settlement and a charge for expected regulatory
penalties related to the card misclassification matter. Excluding unusual items, we would have reported net
income of approximately $915 million, an EPS of about $3.63 per share.
Let's review the details beginning on slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.17%, up 11 basis
points from the prior year and up 14 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion
was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. As anticipated, receivable growth continues to
normalize from its early 2023 peak.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Card receivables increased 7% year-over-year, due to a lower payment rate and a smaller contribution from new
accounts. The payment rate declined about 130 basis points compared to last year, and it is now about 90 basis
points above 2019 levels.
Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year. Spending at restaurants, which is a large category
for sales volume, declined sequentially as a result of being included in the 5% promotion during the first quarter.
Accounting for the influence of promotional categories, sales trends are relatively stable. We continue to see a
cautious consumer, evidenced by less card member spend with lower income households being most affected.
Personal loans were up 13% from their prior year period. In response to market conditions, we prudently
tightened underwriting over the past year, which has served to modestly reduce originations. Student loans were
down 1% year-over-year. As Michael mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our student loan
portfolio. We expect the transaction to be completed in four tranches by the end of 2024.
The purchase price is at a premium to the principal balance and is based on a formula that varies depending on
the closing timing, interest rates and other factors. In association with this development, student loans are now
accounted for as held for sale. The two most notable impacts to the financial statements are that we will no longer
maintain a credit reserve for student loans and future student loan net charge-offs will be recognized through
operating expense rather than credit losses.
Average consumer deposits were up 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Deposit balances are being
managed in relation to our liquidity needs, which will benefit from the student loan sale. Our disciplined approach
to deposit pricing has led to a modest reduction in average deposit rates in the second quarter, consistent with
our practice of leading the industry on pricing in down parts of the cycles.
Looking at other revenue on slide 7, non-interest income increased $313 million or 45%. Discount and
interchange revenue was up $67 million as a result of lower rewards cost. Our rewards rate was 132 basis points
in the period, a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower Cashback
Match. Other income increased due to unusual items, including the litigation settlement and the facility sale. On
an adjusted basis, non-interest revenue grew 14%.
Moving to expenses on slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $325 million or 23% year-over-year. The most
significant driver of this increase was a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card
misclassification issue. It is important to note that actual penalties imposed are subject to further discussions and
may be more or less than this amount. Adjusting for this charge, our expenses would have increased by 9% year-
over-year.
Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs increased $70 million or 12%, primarily due to an
increase in business technology resources. Professional fees were up $80 million or 37%, driven by higher
recovery fees and investments in compliance and risk management. Our expectation for compliance and risk
management expenses for the full year remains in the $500 million range, with an upside bias. This figure
excludes card misclassification-related cost.
Moving to credit performance on slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.83%, 161 basis points higher than the prior
year and down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, delinquency formation improvement continued. The
30-plus day delinquency rate was down 14 basis points versus the prior quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with our 2022 vintage. As we look
into the second half of the year, we expect there could be some variability in monthly card losses from both
seasonality and various credit management actions we've taken. This has not changed our broader outlook for
losses to generally peak and plateau this year.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10, our credit reserve balances declined $777 million from the
prior quarter, reflecting the student loan reserve release, partially offset by a $92 million reserve build primarily to
support loan growth. Our reserve rate was just over 7.2%, largely unchanged after adjusting for student loans.
Looking at slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 for the period was 11.9%, up 100 basis points, bolstered by core
earnings generation and the reserve release. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of
common stock.
Concluding. On slide 12, we have revised our 2024 outlook and have included the impacts of the pending student
loan sale. We are updating our loan growth expectations to be down low-single digits, reflecting the roughly $10
billion asset sale. Absent this, year-over-year loan growth would be consistent with our prior view.
We are increasing our net interest margin range to 11.1% to 11.4%. This change was driven by two factors. We
now anticipate higher card yields, reflecting a lower promotional balance mix and the student loan sale, which
increases NIM by about 10 basis points.
Our operating expense guidance is unchanged, notwithstanding the inclusion of the student loan net charge-offs
in this line item. Our base case for net charge-offs remains at the low end of the 4.9% to 5.2% range. This
includes the 10 basis points impact from student loans. And finally, our capital management expectations have
not changed.
To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results, remain steadfast in our efforts to resolve
compliance matters, and look forward to consummating our planned merger.
This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: This concludes today's call. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for questions.
Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.
