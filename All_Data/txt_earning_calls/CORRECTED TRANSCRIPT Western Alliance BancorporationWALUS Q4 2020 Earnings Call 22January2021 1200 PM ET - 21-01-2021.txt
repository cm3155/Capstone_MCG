Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Good afternoon and welcome to Western Alliance's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today is
Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer. I will first provide an
overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment,
and then Dale will walk you through the bank's financial performance. Afterwards, we will open the lines to take
your questions.
In 2020, Western Alliance broke many of our own records for balance sheet growth, net interest income and
earnings, all the while fortifying our balance sheet position. Our strategy to align the company with strong
borrowers nationwide provided us the strength and flexibility to navigate the economic volatility as we grew our
balance sheet and income, while simultaneously managing asset quality. Despite external challenges, financially,
2020 was a strong year and was our 11th consecutive on rising earnings.
For the year, we produced record net revenues of $1.2 billion, net income of $506.6 million, and EPS of $5.04,
4% greater than 2019 despite increasing the provision expense by $124 million. Our focus continues to be on
PPNR growth, which rose approximately 20% to $746 million. And net interest income increased $126.5 million or
12%, while total expenses increased to modest $9.6 million. To put this in perspective, 2020 revenue expanded
more than 13 times the rate of expenses in a difficult, uneven and complex operating environment. Given all of
these actions, tangible book value per share grew 16.4% year-over-year to $30.90.
Turning to the fourth quarter results, we achieved a record $193.6 million in net income and EPS of $1.93 for the
quarter, an increase of 54% from prior year. These results benefit from a $34.2-million reversal credit loss
provision, consistent with our strong asset quality results and improved go-forward consensus economic outlook.
Outstanding quarterly loan and deposit growth of $1 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, lifted total assets to
$36.5 billion, which was driven by broad based growth throughout our business lines and geographies as clients
begin to plan their investment for future opportunities. Additionally, several of our internal business initiatives
gained traction.
For the full year, loans increased $4.5 billion excluding PPP program or 21%, and deposits grew a record
shattering $9.1 billion, which we believe creates a strong foundation for ongoing loan and earnings growth as the
economy continues to heal from COVID shutdowns. This balance sheet growth propelled net interest income
decline to $315 million for the quarter or 16% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly NIM was 3.84%, up 13 basis
points on the third quarter as PPP income improved and cost – CD cost fell. Fee income increased to $23.8
million for the quarter, aided by $6.4 million of equity and warranty income. On a full year basis, fee income grew
a healthy 8.8% to $17.8 billion.
Full year operating non-interest expense grew $9.6 million to $491.6 million, producing an efficiency ratio of
38.8%. In the fourth quarter, our efficiency ratio improved to 38.2% as revenue growth was 4 times noninterest
expense growth and continues to provide incremental flexibility to grow PPNR. Asset quality continued to improve
this quarter as our COVID remediation strategy produced increasingly positive results for our clients.
Total classified assets declined $102 million in Q4 to 61 basis points of total assets, which was lower than Q1
2020 levels on both on relative and absolute dollar amount, just as the pandemic impact was being felt. At quarter
end, total deferrals had fallen to $190 million or 70 basis points of total loans, including $77 million for low LTV
residential loans. As of today, there are less than $10 million of deferrals excluding the residential portfolio and all
of our hotel franchise finance loans are paying as agreed.
These noticeably positive credit trends, the improved consensus economic outlook, and loan growth, the low risk
asset prices drove our $34.2-million lease loan loss reserves this quarter. Dale will go into more detail on specific

drivers of our provision, but our total loan ACL to funded loan ratio excluding PPP loans now stands at 1.24% or
$316 million. And total loan ACL to total classified assets is 142%. Charge offs were $3.9 million in Q4, and full-
year charge offs were 6 basis points of loans.
Our robust PPNR generation continues to drive strong capital levels with a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, supporting 28%
year-over-year loan growth. Return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 161
basis points and 17.8%, respectively. We remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry. As we
demonstrated throughout 2020, we will continue to support our clients and are encouraged by their participation in
PPP program. And the second round is rolling out. We have begun processing applications and are seeing steady
volumes. But given the size and constraints and other factors, we don't expect the total amount to rise to the
levels we saw in round one.
Finally and most importantly, all of our accomplishments cannot be achieved without the immense efforts made
by the people of Western Alliance to success – excuse me, to successfully respond to the challenging COVID-19
environment, which has strongly positioned and prepared the company for whatever may come our way as we
enter 2021. We take pride in our peer leading performance in good times but above all during the challenging
moments.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Thanks, Ken. For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $193.6 million or $1.93 EPS, each up
more than 40% on a linked-quarter basis. As mentioned, net income benefited from a release of provision
expense of $34.2 million, primarily driven by improvement in the economic outlook during the quarter in loan
growth and lower risk asset classes.
Net interest income grew $30.1 million during the quarter to $314.8 million, an increase of 10.6% quarter-over-
quarter and significantly above Q2's performance as – to which we guided. Noninterest income increased $3.2
million to $23.8 million from the prior quarter, supported by a $5.1-million of warrant gains related to our
technology lending. Noninterest expense increased $8.1 million, mainly driven by an increase in incentive
accruals, and so our fourth quarter performance exceeded the original budget targets which were established pre-
pandemic.
Continued balance sheet growth generating superior net interest income drove pre-provision net revenue of
$206.4 million, up 30.4% year-over-year and up substantially from the first and third quarters of 2020 as the
second quarter benefited from one-time items of PPP loan fee recognition and bank owned life insurance
restructuring.
For the year, Western Alliance generated record net income of $506.6 million or $5.04 per share, an increase
over full year 2019 even when considering elevated provision expense of $124 million for the year. Net interest
income grew $126.5 million during the year to $1.2 billion, an increase of 12.2% year-over-year, mainly
attributable to increased loan balances, PPP loan fees and a 49% reduction in interest expense.
Noninterest income increased $5.7 million to $70.8 million from the prior year. We recognized the one-time benefit
of a BOLI restructuring during Q2 of $5.6 million. Finally, noninterest expenses increased $9.6 million or just 2%
year-over-year as increases in short-term incentive accruals and technology costs were offset by lower deposit
costs.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Turning now to our net interest drivers. Investment yields decreased 18 basis points from the prior quarter to
2.61%, and fell 35 basis points from the prior year due to a lower rate environment. On a linked-quarter basis,
loan yields rose 20 basis points following increased yields across most loan types, mainly driven by a changing
loan mix and higher PPP yield related to prepayment assumptions on forgivable amounts. PPP yield for the
quarter was 3.67%, compared to 1.76% for the third quarter.
Interest-bearing deposit costs were reduced by 6 basis points in Q4 to 25 basis points with an end of the quarter
spot rate of 23 basis points as higher cost CDs roll off. Spot rate for total deposits, which includes non-interest
bearing deposits, was 13 basis points. We expect funding costs have essentially stabilized at these levels.
However, there could be marginal benefits as higher cost CDs continue to mature and are in place at lower rates.
Current spot rates indicate a relatively stable margin as we enter 2021. Some decline in loan yield is expected as
the mix is changed to lower risk segments.
With regards to our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably since the beginning of 2019 with
82% of our loans now behaving as fixed due to floors for variable rate loans and mix shift towards fixed rate
residential loans. We continue to be asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases with an
estimated increase in net interest income of 5.7% from a 100 basis point rate increase in a parallel shock
scenario, versus a 0.9% contraction in net interest income if rates fell and flat lined at 0.
As Ken mentioned, this year, we demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income by 15.7% year-over-year
despite the transition to a substantially lower rate environment. Net interest income increased $30.1 million or
10.6% during the quarter as net interest margin increased to 3.84%. The margin benefited from both a true-up
related to PPP fee recognition, favorable deposit mix shift and improved deposit rates.
As mentioned earlier, during the fourth quarter, our extraordinary deposit growth and build in liquidity continues to
weigh on the margin and had a negative impact of 9 basis points this quarter. Adjusting for this, the margin would
have been slightly above the 3.9% guidance we gave during the last quarterly call.
PPP loans increased our NIM during Q4 by 11 basis points as we trued up from changes to prepayment
assumptions made during Q3, resulting in a PPP loan yield of 3.67%. Notice the gold line on the bar chart
showing NIM excluding volatility related to PPP. NIM was 3.8% for Q4 and essentially flat from the third quarter.
Average excess liquidity, relative to loans, increased $467 million in the quarter, the majority of which is held at
the FRB, earning minimal returns, which reduced NIM by approximately 9 basis points in aggregate. Given our
healthy loan pipeline and ability to deploy these funds to higher yielding earning assets, we expect margin drag to
dissipate in coming quarters.
Referring to the chart on the lower-left section of the page, of the $43 million in total PPP loan fees, net of
origination costs, $11 million was recognized in the fourth quarter. We recognized the reversal of PPP loan fees in
the third quarter of $6.4 million and expect fee recognition to be approximately $6.6 million in Q1 and taper off as
prepayments and forgiveness are realized. As the second round of PPP is just underway, these fee accretion
assumptions only apply to the initial round of funding.
Turning now to efficiency, our efficiency ratio improved to 38.2% in Q4 as the increase in expenses was
outweighed by revenue growth and only rose 2% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding PPP net loan fees
and interest, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been 39.9% and, as we indicated last quarter, should
be returning to historical levels in the low-40s.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Pre-provision net revenue increased $25.2 million or 13.9% from the prior quarter and 30.4% from the same
period last year. This resulted in pre-provision net revenue ROA of 2.37% for the quarter, an increase of 15 basis
points from Q3 and equal to the year-ago period. This strong performance in capital generation provides us
significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions or meet credit demands
from our clients.
Our strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $1 billion, net of $271
million of PPP loan payoffs, to $27.1 billion; and deposit growth of $3.1 billion brought our deposit balance to
$31.9 billion at year-end. Inclusive of PPP, loans grew 28% year-over-year, while deposits grew approximately
40% year-over-year with our focus on low loss loan segments and DDA.
Loan to deposit ratio decreased 84.7% from 90.2% in Q3 as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us
with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs. As deposit growth continues to outpace loan origination, our
cash position remains elevated at $2.7 billion at year-end. However, we believe it provides us inventory for
selective credit growth as demand resumes.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $1.87 over the prior quarter to $30.90, with an increase of $4.36
or 16.4% over the prior year. Our strong loan growth is a direct result of our flexible business model, which
combines national commercial banking relationships with our regional footprint and enables thoughtful growth
throughout economic cycles. The vast majority of the $1 billion in growth was driven by increases in C&I loans of
$655 million, supplemented by CRE non-owner occupied loans of $248 million. Residential and consumer loans
now comprise 9.2% of our loan portfolio, while construction loan concentration increased modestly to 9% of total
loans.
Within the C&I growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on low-risk assets, capital call lines grew $408
million, mortgage warehouse lines grew $413 million, and corporate finance loans decreased to $122 million this
quarter. Residential loan originations added $56 million to balances by quarter end, net of refinance activity.
We continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits as both the key differentiator and a core value driver
to our firm's long-term value creation. Notably, year-over-year deposit growth of $9.1 million is more than double
the annual deposit growth of any previous calendar year. Deposits grew $3.1 billion or 10.7% in the fourth quarter,
driven by increases in savings and money market of $1.8 billion, interest-bearing DDA of $842 million and non-
interest bearing DDA of $450 million, which comprises 42% of our deposit base.
Robust activity in tech and innovation and market share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be significant
drivers of deposit growth during the quarter. Additionally, one of our deposit initiatives that is fully online
contributed over $1 billion in deposit growth in 2020.
Looking at asset quality, total classified assets decreased $102 million in Q4 due to credit upgrades, payoffs and
refinance activity away from WAL. Our non-performing loans and OREO ratio decreased to 32 basis points to
total assets until the classified assets fell to 61 basis points of total assets at year-end, which was below the ratio
at the end of 2019.
Special mention loans decreased $26 million during the quarter to 1.67% of funded loans. As we've discussed
before, special mention loans are a result of our credit mitigation strategy to early identify, elevate, and apply
heightened monitoring to loans or segments impacted by the current COVID environment and fluctuate as credit
migrates in and out. We do not see a risk of material losses coming from these credits.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Regarding loan deferrals, as Ken mentioned, as of today, we have less than $10 million of deferrals excluding
approximately $77 million in low LTV residential loans with an upgraded average loan-to-value under 67%. All of
our hotel franchise finance loans are paying as agreed and our sophisticated hotel sponsors continued to confirm
support with our budget.
Net credit losses of $3.9 million or 6 basis points of average loans were recognized during the quarter compared
to $8.2 million in Q3. Our loan allowance for credit losses decreased $39 million from the prior quarter to $316
million due to improvement in economic forecasts and loan growth and portfolio segments with low expected loss
rate. In all, the total ACL to funded loans declined 20 basis points to 1.17% or 1.24% when excluding PPP loans.
On a more granular level, our low loss asset classes account for approximately 40% of our portfolio and include
mortgage warehouse, residential and HOA lending, capital call lines, public finance, and resort lending. When
excluding these components, the ACL to funded loans on the remainder of the portfolio is 1.7%.
We continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with common equity
tangible assets of 8.6% and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points during the
quarter due to our strong loan growth. Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 per share, our
tangible book value per share rose $1.87 in the quarter to $30.90, an increase of 16% in the past year. We
continue to grow our tangible book value per share rapidly as it increased three times that of the peer group for
the past six years.
I will hand the call back over to Ken.

Thanks, Dale. We believe that our fourth quarter performance was the baseline for future balance sheet and
earnings growth, building off the robust growth we had in the fourth quarter, our pipelines are strong and we
expect loan to deposit growth of $600 million to $800 million for the next several quarters. Both loans and
deposits each have their own cyclical and seasonal behavior that are not aligned on a quarterly basis.
As Dale mentioned, given our deposit growth and liquidity build, we expect there to be some downward pressure
on NIM related to mix changes and the deployment of liquidity into attractive asset classes. Additionally, we will
continue to see NIM influence on a quarterly basis by the wave of PPP loans being forgiven and the second round
of PPP loans coming on line. Strong PPNR growth will continue with – balance sheet momentum will drive higher
net interest income, which more than offset the planned increase in non-interest expense.
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational
efficiency, which will eventually push our efficiency ratio back to sustainable levels in the low 40s. Our long-term
asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic [indiscernible] (00:24:03) forecast, which is
consistent going forward could imply a steady reserve ratio.
Depending on the timing and pace of the recovery, there could be some long migration into the special mention
category but we do not expect material migrations into sub-standard. We believe that the provisions in excess of
charge-offs since the pandemic began are more than sufficient to cover charge-offs through the cycle as we do
not see any indicators that imply material losses are on the horizon.

Finally, WAL is one of the most prolific capital generators in the industry. Our strong capital base and access to
ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of any market dislocations and any raising risk adjusted returns and
to address any future credit demands, all while maintaining flexibility to improve shareholder returns.
At this time, Dale, Tim, and I are happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brad Milsaps with Piper Sandler. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. How are you doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Good, Brad.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Dale, just wanted to maybe kind of focus in on the margin and the balance sheet. It sounds like you're going to be
able to mostly fund the growth that you expect this year with continued deposit growth, would you anticipate with
the liquidity that you have continuing to add to the bottom portfolio? And then just as a follow up to that, it did look
like the loan fees ex-PPP were maybe higher than normal this quarter. Could you address that? Have you found a
new loan category that might generate more fees? Or is that something that might be considered abnormal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yes. So, again, as you probably saw, we did increase bond purchases in the fourth quarter. I think that that is
going to continue. We're under 85% on loan to deposit ratio. We're certainly comfortable with that climbing. I'm not
sure that's going to happen as the deposit pipeline continues to look fairly strong to us, certainly.
So if that's the case, so I think we do want to deploy some of this capital. We've been sitting on a large chunk of
cash. It hasn't been all negative, although the returns we're getting are quite nominal. I mean, the yields has back
up a little bit. So, I'd rather start extending now in terms of investments rather than maybe last fall when it was
difficult to even reach 1% on a residential mortgage backed securities from a GSE.
In terms of the loan fees, yeah, you're right Brad. That number even excluding PPP was elevated in the fourth
quarter. And I'm going to call that essentially but non-recurring. We just had some things that paid off that helped
that number. You can kind of see that if you look at the note rate versus the average rate for the loan book and
then it's a little bit lower at the end of the year than it was for the fourth quarter.

That's reflected in there that the yield was a little bit higher. So that will be a little bit lower in loan fees kind of
going forward excluding PPP. That said, PPP could be up here as you know as we're just getting started on round
two.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. That's helpful and then final question for me and I'll hop back into queue. Just around the hotel portfolio, I
think you both said that it's paying as agreed, you don't have any deferrals in that category. Should we
understand that as it's paying as agreed under the terms of your 6 plus 6 or 3 plus 3 program? Or are all of these
operators, all of your institutional borrowers actually making new P&I payments that they didn't put up as escrow
initially?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Brad, the deferral programs are completed. So, these guys are paying as agreed under the original terms. We're
seeing good sponsorship and commitment to these properties. And as Tim Bruckner always tells me, our
sponsors at least feel they can see the end of this issue coming with the vaccine being released and being
implemented.
So, it's their impression and ours as well that this won't be going on for too much longer. And that's what makes
them feel comfortable to continue to support the properties. Plus, as you know, we've got a very good loan-to-
value here and there's a lot of equity sitting in front of us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
But would you be able to say kind of what percentage of the properties are supporting themselves with their own
cash flow without the sponsor support? Can you define it that way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I'd say, how I'll define it, overall, our October or November occupancy was about 42% or – and I would say that –
I'm trying to think of the best way to give you that answer. I would say about two-thirds of our hotel book had
occupancies over operating expenses. So when you think about it if you go back a year, the breakeven point was
at 39% occupancy level. Today, the 39% still holds, but what's changed is the RevPAR has come down
dramatically but operators have been able to cut out their expenses in order to generate the cash flow to offset
their operating expenses. They haven't fully yet gotten to the point where they can cover debt service coverage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Very helpful. Thank you, guys, very much.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Hey, thanks for the question. Wanted to follow up real quick on Brad's question on kind of the hotel book and
maybe even tack on the casino book as well, and just kind of an update in light of the second round of PPP. I
assume most of those operators will be eligible, and so that will give them a nice capital and cash infusion as well
that won't be as dependent on the sponsors. Is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, the first time around, we probably put out between $32 million and $36 million of PPP loans. A lot of the
hotels don't get the cash flow from PPP because they've got separate management companies away from the
hotels that manage them. So I wouldn't expect that the amount of PPP funding that's going to go to the hotel
group will be less than round one. And also, there's a cap on the amount of dollars that's being distributed, no
greater than $2 million.
Tim, do you want to add anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I would add. Yeah, and we'll follow with gaming. We underwrite sponsorship as much as we underwrite the hotel
or when we underwrite our hotel book. So as Ken mentioned, $36 million on the first round, not a big taker of PPP
for two reasons: one, because of the strength of sponsorship: and two, because the PPP follows the payroll and
the structure of the hotel. Loans usually have that at the management company.
So we don't expect a big taker. We also are in such frequent and ongoing dialogue that we don't see the inability
of sponsorship to carry. We're very confident in that ongoing sponsorship and the relationship that we have there.
With respect to gaming, our gaming again is off strip. So most of our gaming won't qualify for PPP because
they've got revenue gains, not revenue reduction. So the gaming portfolio has really moved out of the spotlight in
terms of concern because of the strong performance that we've seen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I would categorize it as Tim said, 100 off strip, 100% of the casinos are open for business. The portfolio
demonstrated the ability to operate at breakeven cash flow or better in these times. The majority are
outperforming their pre-COVID revenue and cash flow plan.
So when you think about that statement, why would they be doing that? There's no place else for people to go.
And these casinos are open. Plus, they've received funds from the government that they have a little excess cash
or they haven't spent a lot of the cash. So it represents a form of entertainment. And just to re-emphasize what
Tim said, this portfolio does not represent an outsized risk or concern for us at this time

Okay. That's really helpful color. And maybe just touching on the growth side, the $600 million to $800 million you
called out. Can you maybe peel back the onion on that a bit and just give us a little color on what you're seeing
today? In particular with mortgage warehouse potentially being a pressure on a year-over-year basis, was that
guidance kind of on held for investment loans or does that include the warehouse, et cetera?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So first thing I'll say is $600 million to $800 million is a little bit higher than what we said in the previous
quarters, which was $500 million to $800 million, so I would note that. I would tell you during the course of the
year for 2020, we had a lot of growth come in our capital call business and that was over $800 million.
Warehouse lending, this is traditional warehouse lending, year-over-year grew by $1.7 billion. But note, financing
grew by $400 million. All the bank regions collectively grew by $500 million-plus, and our resi grew by $300
million, followed by tech and innovation growing $125 million. And even our resort lending grew year-over-year
$182 million.
So that's sort of perspective backwards. As we think about forward for 2021, in that number, we have little to no
growth coming out of traditional warehouse lending. We're assuming that it just holds its position at year-end
predominantly. Now, if we're surprised, we want to be surprised on the upside. But we didn't build a lot of that
opportunity yet. And I just went through the full-year results for 2020, you can see that a lot of that would come
forward into 2021.
And as Dale like to always remind folks, our pressure valve is around residential loans. And we could always turn
that knob up a little bit and bring in more residential loans if we need to. We've got a lot of runway ahead of us to
be anywhere close to what a traditional bank would have in terms of a percentage of residential loans to total
loans.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Dale, the 40% bogey that you're talking about or efficiency ratio, I'm
interested in kind of the details on that. Looking at this year's results, expense growth was quite remarkably low,
given the growth at 4%. Are you kind of telegraphing that expenses are going to reaccelerate a bit next year or
these are more of a revenue component? I'm just trying to get a sense of that 40% line in the sand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I'm certainly optimistic about revenues. I think they're going to be strong. I think we're going to have strong
loan growth again as we've discussed a minute ago, perhaps some more deployment into securities. That will pick
up yield from what's in cash right now. But the expense side, there is going to be some catch-up element.
So just a couple of things that held back 2020 expenses. Our travel expenses were down by more than two-thirds.
We think there is a benefit to actually getting on the road, meeting with clients. And as we get past this, I think
that's going to pick up maybe in the second and third quarter and probably no later than that. There's other costs
related to that. We didn't have our management conference this year. That's something that will come into play in
2021 as well.

So, there's costs related to pandemic that were suppressed in 2020. We also have investments that we continue
to need to make in risk management, in IT infrastructure. We expect to continue to do that. Those were – maybe
put on a slower path of growth for 2020. We expect those are probably going to reaccelerate to some degree.
So, yes, I do think our numbers are going to be – it's going to be to the four instead of a three. It's going to be a
low 40s certainly. And the revenue is going to be right there with it. So we're going to be seeing a significant
increase in earnings per share. Revenue growth in dollars will be more than double certainly of what we're doing
in terms of expense growth in dollars.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Chris, I just want to add. We're sitting at $36.5 billion now of total assets. And when we hit $50 billion or as we hit
$50 billion, our risk management practices have to continue to evolve. So we need to start spending money
today. Our growth rate has been far greater than I think we even thought. And so we need to hire some folks to
maintain that growth rate on the operational side as well.
And as Dale said, it's artificially depressed, that 38%. That's just not a sustainable level to continue to invest in the
infrastructure and technology needed to grow. And of course there's always some new business development in
terms of new business lines that we like that are always embedded in that line as well. So, again, we've got the
revenue coverage to exceed the expense growth. And next year, you can look for us to be back in the low 40s.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And if I could just – one more on the margin. Just want to make sure I got the messaging. So if we look
through in the deposit and liquidity build like a lot of your peers are experiencing that's going to put pressure. And
then you talked about the loan fees. Is the right way to think about just core margin excluding PPP adding modest
pressure or did you – I can't remember [indiscernible] (00:39:27). I think I heard two different things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, yeah, it's really PPP. I think there's modest pressure because I think we've – even in the fourth quarter, we've
had loan risk into these lower risk and hence lower yielding categories. And so, that's put a little pressure on it. On
the loan fees that we had in the fourth quarter, excluding away from PPP, we're a little bit elevated from some pay
offs that we had. And so once you have a loan pay off early, all the loan fees that have been deferred are brought
back in. And so, that added a little bit to the fourth quarter number as well, which I don't necessarily anticipate
continuing.
So, I'm not going to call that a big number, but it's got to have a little pressure in terms of the number itself. Again,
what we're focused on is net interest income and PPNR growth. I mean, hey, we could have pushed away some
of this deposit growth that we had in the fourth quarter. But because it would have – that obviously damages our
NIM. We think that's a good problem to have. I like to be able to take those dollars. I know there's liquidity
abundance within the industry today. Our view is that it isn't always going to be the case. And we want to be able
to have the resources, have the inventory that we can lend out and sustain a superior growth trajectory over our
peers.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Chris, I just want to give you an incremental perspective. Everyone talks about NIM and they've sort of divorce
sometimes from our credit quality. And I think what's important to know is that we've got a number of business
lines, capital call, warehouse lending, note financing, MSR lending, residential loans, resource financing, muni
and nonprofit. When you look at what our fourth quarter balances are, you add up the collective sum of those
areas, we have $11.5 billion of balances that have never had a loss attached to them. Sorry, let me correct
myself. They've had one loss for $400,000 several years ago. But basically have never had a loss attached to
them. And that's 42% of our total loan base.
So when you think about NIM, I think it's also important to think about risk adjusted NIM. That's the way I think
about it. That, yeah, NIM shrinks a little bit. That's okay in the sense that we're going to still be getting good strong
growth which is going to go to Dale's net interest income comment. But also we're not going to see a increase in
provisioning based upon the growth in these subsectors that I just mentioned.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It's kind of funny as I was talking to the head of that area the other day. I said, hey, let's go. Let's review Galton in
case I get a question about it. He assured me that there would be no question about Galton because it's not big
enough. And I said, hey, everyone's going to be interested. So, let me just tell you what's going on there.
The integration is going well. All right. We had to sign up their existing customers onto our platform and we had to
go through that legal and I'd say formal process. The other thing we have to do is roll out our prequalified
approach, which means we had to roll out a pricing engine and roll out a credit engine. And a lot of that's going to
be fully completed by the end of the quarter as we go into Q2.
So, have we gotten some volume from Galton? Yes. Have we gotten the buying that we expect? No, not yet. We
see the pipeline building. And I think it's going to have more of an impact in Q – it will have more of an impact in
Q2 than it will have in Q1. And remember, they come with 100 different clients and there's only a 30% crossover
or overlapping with our existing base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then I'm not sure how easy this would be to answer, but warrant gains
obviously very strong this quarter. I know they're kind of spotty when you look historically. But as you're looking at
the strength you're seeing in the capital call line business and just in the tech ecosystem generally speaking, is
there a gauge for what the pipeline looks on some of the income from the equity investments? Or is that still going
to be up and down every single quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It's going to be up and down. It's very hard for us to determine that. What I can tell you is with the increase in
liquidity in the tech and innovation space, some of that's come for us in terms of loans have fallen, but the onset of
the loans falling are the fact that we're getting these equity gains. So, we're happy that we always have it built into
our loan docs. We don't get any equity gains around the capital call lines. And as I've said, very hard for us to
forecast those gains.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And from a lending standpoint in that business, obviously, there's many new competitors that are also seeing
great growth and success in that line. Is there enough for everybody or are you starting to see some of the better
credits and relationships get more competitive as more lenders step into the space?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
There's a little more competition because there are more competitors. But many of them like to go either into –
we're in Stage 2, if you will. Our Stage 1, early development, Stag 2, you have some maturities. Yeah, you see
the revenues growing. The product has been proven or the service has been proven. But they are still spending a
lot more money and marketing in order to drive up revenue and drive up their brand recognition, name
recognition. And then Stage 3, they're getting ready to do some type of things, either an IPO or some type of
strategic sale.

So some of the players that are in Stage 3 don't really compete with us because we're not in Stage 3 and they're
looking at it in terms of exit fees, and those would be the larger banks. We don't play there. Some of the banks
playing in the early stage and that's not where we have our skill set. So we're in the middle stage. And yes, there's
a little more competition, but it's – I would say we're not we're not losing a lot of business. We're going after it.
We're winning that business and we're winning it on service.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. A couple of quick questions. Can you just touch on the change in segment reporting? I know it's not a big
deal, but kind of help us understand what's different and what changes and why you did that. And the reporting
lines or anything else changed?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, well, a couple of things. So, our segments were a bit unique relative to other institutions. And I think
maybe perhaps it conveyed to some degree that we were an assimilation of a commercial business lines put
together. And I think that maybe did not appropriately convey that actually, we have a lot of interdependencies
among these enterprises, among these businesses that we focus on that we think have kind of superior growth
and asset quality metrics.
And so some of them are – consumers have liquidity, others are certainly providers of liquidity. And I think that the
new structure reflects that better that it's more of a holistic enterprise in terms of what we're being able to
accomplish with these business lines that we've selected out to have expertise in.
The other – another thing is if you look at where the industry is, this is much more closely aligns with it. We had
almost the most number of segments of any institution out there. Now, we're going to three. That's pretty much in
line. And even I think JPMorgan has four or five. So, I think it looks better like that.
The other thing as well is we have Consumer Related segment. And I think – historically, I think people have
thought about us is really primarily just a commercial enterprise. But we do have a lot of consumer dependencies
in our balance sheet and what we're doing. I think this highlights that better as well. It's how we're really managing
the company and how we think about it.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Resort finance, warehouse lending.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. Tim, maybe one for you on reserves. I think I hear the message on you're probably set and
we're not going to see more reserve releases from here. But can you talk a little bit about some of your economic
forecast when you cut it off and whether you expect to see some improvement over the next couple of quarters in
some of the qualitative pieces of your reserve building?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Sure. Okay. So we look at reserves as kind of really the convergence of portfolio composition. Our behavior in
remediating and then what's happening in the economy. So with the economy, we've seen the prognosticators
really come a lot closer together over the last quarter. So we talk about consensus, the consensus view, aligning
generally to a consensus view. That's become easier to do as we've progressed.
We have a consensus outlook or we shape to align with the consensus outlook when we look at our reserves.
Then we get into the composition of our portfolio and really separate into near-term and longer-term risk. And so,
the things in this economy right now that have been pressed with near-term risk, we just don't have that much of.
The small business lending, the point of retail and restaurant, small business lending, it's not much that we do.
And then when we look at our behaviors, we look at the stuff that is potentially under-secured, things that are
cash flow dependent. And look at – we started remediating that in February. So we brought that balance down
from $126 million of what was substandard to $29 million at year-end. So when we look at it, we look at it and say,
what is going to be impacted. And then we test that against our LGD. The macro drivers are very favorable based
on our portfolio composition.

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I want to take the chance to bring this up, Jon, and just go a little off your question, but driving home back to the
provisioning and really kind of talk about how we see next year for a moment, and I'll wrap the provision in.
So Q4, we are in $1.93. As we think about going forward into 2021, if you take out the reversal of $34 million and
you look towards the third quarter when we added about $15 million and you normalize for that going forward and
taken on an after-tax basis and then normalize for the increase in PPP income for Q4, it gets you to about $1.47
run rate, right? And if you do your $1.47 times 4, that gets you to just a little under $5.90. And we kind of gave you
that same math last quarter when we were on the $1.36 and we annualized it, we got to $5.46.
So that's how we're moving the business forward based on that with a viewpoint that we will be increasing our
provisions next year. But as Tim said, if the economic forecast improves or, as we said in our prepared remarks, if
the economic forecast improves or if we continue to grow – our growth is stronger in those low to no risk
segments or lost segments, you can see that provision coming down. And that would add to the EPS numbers I
just mentioned.
So I want that it connect provision going forward to what we think is our baseline set of numbers as we come out
of 2020 into 2021. So I hope that's a little more color for you guys and gives you a sense of where the company is
going.

coming out of the pandemic? Or do you need to keep it out of the certain size of the institution go forward, et
cetera, et cetera? Just kind of your updated thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, it's not going to be growth gone wild in the hotel book. I'll say, since the early part of 2020 when the
pandemic took hold, we've only done five, maybe six hotel loans. Those hotel purchases were done by our
borrowers away from us. They purchased more distressed properties, probably at discounted prices of up to 30%.
And then, we've structured it in such a way that our LTVs are no greater than 50%. So up to a 30% reduction.
We've lowered our LTVs and we've strengthened the terms and conditions and we've continued to get the same
price.
So if we see deals like that, those are very, very strong deals. And if they're in the top primary, MSA primary – or
sorry, I should say top MSAs in primary and secondary locations that we like, we'll continue to do that. But right
now, the hotel sponsors and operators are there. They're waiting. They're a little cautious and they haven't put
their foot down on the pedal yet. They want to see their volumes come back before they extend themselves.
And they're also waiting to see if they could pick up any distressed deals. We haven't sold any of our notes or
anything like that. Our clients haven't sold any of their properties that we're financing as distressed. But so, I
guess, I'm saying it's still a little hard for us to handicap. But we are financing properties when they meet the
criteria of being bought at a discount and we can do it at a lower LTV.
And I should also say that, they're coming on a lower LTV and they're putting off a year's worth of operating
reserves and a year's worth of principal and interest here. So we're getting those programs way up front. And
because of that, we like still doing the financing, very strong in terms of underwriting.

Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Ken, I want to follow up on the discussion about the Bridge Bank
subsidiary because you – that company is in a unique part of that ecosystem. The industry out there is booming
right now. And so, from the deposit growth standpoint, how much are you counting on that company or the
business for deposit growth this next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, the tech and innovation side generates usually 2.5 to 3 times loan growth. So, yes, we're – first of all, we're
counting on all our areas to generate both deposit and loan growth. No one gets through a budget process with us
without getting their – working on their balance sheet. But last year, the tech and innovation did nearly $1.1 billion
of deposit growth. And there was a lot of cash that was flushed into that business.

I don't think we're going to see as much come in this year. So, I wouldn't expect as much on the tech and
innovation. But tech and innovation, like science, I expect for them to contribute in terms of next year's deposit
growth. And also some of our new business initiatives should continue – deposit initiatives still continue to

Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, our growth is real strong. And so our capital generation is supporting our balance sheet growth. So, that's
the first and simplest answer.
We are – there's been a lot more deal conversation that we're seeing that has come across our desk. We're a little
bit more interested in the deal conversation that is around possibly new products or new initiatives – new products
for us or new niches or – that we could somehow enhance and grow.
So, we do see some of those opportunities. None of them have fit our model. So as I've said, the capital
generation has been used to support our balance sheet growth.
