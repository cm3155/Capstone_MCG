MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Columbia Banking System's First Quarter
2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers'
presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Clint Stein, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Columbia Banking Systems. Please go ahead.

Thank you, Catherine. Welcome and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our first quarter results. The earnings release and accompanying investor presentation are available at
columbiabank.com.
Our first quarter financial performance was outstanding. Net income of $57.5 million and EPS of $0.74 per share
were the best first quarter on record. Our bankers delivered with solid loan and deposit growth, credit remains
stellar, and expenses were well managed. During the quarter, we also completed the integration of the Bank of
Commerce Holdings acquisition and integration activities related to our combination with Umpqua Holdings are
also proceeding very well. The integration management office, led by executives from both banks, has done an
excellent job seeking out and addressing any challenges that can arise in a sizable combination. As a result,
teams from both companies have coalesced to ensure a smooth and timely close once the necessary regulatory
approvals are received.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the line and
take your questions.
Before I turn the call over to Aaron, I need to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the
call. For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release or website
or our SEC filings.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Clint and good morning, everyone. First quarter pre-tax, pre-provision income of $67.4 million, net
income of $57.5 million, and earnings per share of $0.74 were all new first quarter highs in spite of $7.1 million of
merger-related costs, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Average earning assets increased by $3.8
billion from the first quarter of 2021, including $1.8 billion from the Merchants Bank acquisition. This combined
with the partial quarter impact of the Fed's March rate increase, resulted in an increase in net interest income of
$22 million or 18% over the prior year period.
Linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision income increased by $704,000. Adjusting for merger-related costs, PPNR
decreased by $4.1 million, partly due to the seasonal reset of payroll taxes and benefit costs, as well as increased
expense related to the higher starting wage we implemented year-end and more recent annual merit adjustments.
In addition, loan-related expenses normalized from a low level in the prior quarter. Total deposits ended the
quarter at $18.3 billion, which was an increase of $289 million from year-end. First quarter inflows were
predominantly in our money suite market product and our cost of deposits remained at our all-time low of just 4
basis points.
Total loans ended the quarter at $10.8 billion. Excluding PPP balances, loans increased by $219 million or 8.4%
annualized. Growth was propelled by $464 million in new loan originations and a modest increase in line
utilization. PPP forgiveness and paydowns dampened overall loan growth by $101 million, reducing total loan
growth to $118 million, but still a solid 4.4% annualized.
The net interest margin of 3.12% was up 7 basis points on the linked quarter basis, mostly due to higher yields
and investment securities and that was largely due to lower premium amortization on the portfolio. PPP loans had
a positive 3 basis points impact in the first quarter, which was down from 6 basis points in the fourth quarter. New
loans were brought on at an average tax-adjusted coupon rate of [ph] 3.61% (04:28), which compares to the
overall portfolio excluding PPP of [ph] 3.84% (04:34). Notably, our balance sheet remains very well-positioned for
the rate increases expected to continue through the year. Still, we may not see all of that benefit materialize in
new loans given the intense price competition across our footprint as industry liquidity remains very high.
Non-interest income was relatively flat on a linked quarter basis at $24.2 million. Favorable non-recurring items
during the quarter included gains of $868,000 and $311,000 respectively on the sale of loans and the Health
Savings Account portfolio acquired from Merchants Bank. In addition, we had a $395,000 gain on the sale of a
vacant branch property. These one-time items offset declines in mortgage banking and loan-related income
attributed to the higher interest rate environment.
Non-interest expense of $105.1 million increased by $2.4 million linked quarter. After adjusting for merger-related
expenses of $7.1 million in the first quarter and $11.8 million in the fourth quarter, non-interest expenses

increased by $7.2 million to $98 million. The linked quarter increase was mostly due to the aforementioned rise in
compensation costs and loan expenses, as well as a $2.5 million increase in the provision for off balance sheet
liabilities.
As seasonally elevated compensation costs drop off and Merchants Bank cost saves are fully realized, we expect
our expense run rate to be closer to the mid-90s. The provision for income taxes increased $2.5 million on a
linked quarter basis to $15.6 million, representing a 21.3% effective rate. And we expect our 2022 tax rate to
remain in the 20% to 22% range ahead of our combination with Umpqua.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron. It's been a busy quarter and we are seeing positive results from investments in our production
and our support teams. As Aaron mentioned, non-PPP loan production of $464 million was the largest first and
our fourth highest quarter on record. This is on the heels of our best quarter in company history ex-PPP of $640
million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Our bankers continue to be successful in winning new business in the face of an intensely competitive lending
environment. As the economy has reopened and expanded, our bankers deepened existing and built new
relationships in all of our markets. Both producers and clients across our footprint appreciate the value of the
upcoming combination with Umpqua and the increased capabilities that it will bring.
Our pipelines remain full and to our satisfaction. Line utilization was modestly during the quarter. Increases in
construction line utilization were offset by the normal seasonal decrease in agriculture. Across the footprint, a
cold, wet spring has delayed plantings for many crops, resulting in weaker than normal advances. We anticipate
this to reverse in the second quarter as the warmer, drier weather returns.
The quarterly production mix was 65% fixed, 25% floating, and 10% variable. The overall portfolio now stands at
1% PPP loans, 54% non-PPP fixed, 30% floating, and 15% variable. As a result of higher rates, we saw a drop in
our mortgage warehouse business during the quarter with sold loans dropping from $75 million to $57 million.
Overall, the composition of the loan portfolio did not change materially. Deposits grew at an annualized rate of 6%
during the quarter and 24% over the past 12 months. The sourcing of deposits was stable at 59% business and
41% commercial. Similarly, the mix of deposits were fairly steady at 48% non-interest-bearing and 52% interest
bearing. During the quarter we moved our WA branch to a new financial hub location. And in July, we will be
opening our Proctor District financial Hub in Tacoma and have begun construction on a new financial hub in
Astoria, Oregon. These full service locations are uniquely focused on helping our clients achieve the
comprehensive financial goals, including investments, trust services, and other financial considerations.
Now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. For the quarter, we released $7.8 million from our allowance. This reduces our allowance from
1.46% to 1.37% compared to period end loan total. Driving the release was a decline in problem loans.
Substandard loans declined $68 million to around $303 million or 2.82% of total loans, and special mention loans

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
declined $30 million to around $70 million or less than 1% of total loans. Problem loans as a percentage of total
period-end loans is now approaching pre-pandemic level. To a lesser extent, a modest decline in the loss rate for
pass rated loans due to our most recent level of low charge-off activity also contributed to the release.
The IHS Markit forecast, which we use for modeling purposes, was fairly stable compared to last quarter and as
such, did not have a marked impact on our reserves for the quarter. For example, last quarter, the unemployment
rate was expected in 2022 at 3.4% and remain at or below present pre-pandemic levels throughout the forecast
period. The current forecast also assumes the unemployment rate will end 2022 at 3.4% and remain near pre-
pandemic levels throughout the forecast period. The current forecast assumes full year GDP growth expectations
for 2022 of 3.3% compared to previous expectations of 4.3%, so last but not material.
In summary, we are seeing credit quality metrics similar to that, which we enjoyed pre-pandemic. While we are
pleased with this performance, we remain cognizant of the current global environment and instability in Europe,
along with the inflationary pressures here at home. So, while we are optimistic for the future performance of the
portfolio near term, we remain cautious as we look further down the road.
Okay. Back to Clint.

Thanks, Andy. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 was announced this morning. This quarter's dividend will
be paid on May 18 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 4. This concludes our prepared
comments. As a reminder, Andy, Chris, and Aaron are with me to answer your questions.
Now, Catherine, we'll open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
A couple of questions on the loan portfolio. The non-PPP payoffs and prepays, I think in the current quarter was a
little over $200 million combined. What was that figure last quarter? And then you touched on the line utilization,
what exactly was that percent that you touched on that was up a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think the line utilization was up something like 60 basis points. Let me see if I've got the exact number for you.
Yeah, it rose from 43.3 basis points to 43.9 basis points. And what was the question on the PPP balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
What was, I think prepays and payoffs in the non-PPP, I think it was a little over $200 million in the current quarter
if you combine those. Well, how does that compare to the fourth quarter? In other words, payoffs and prepays...
[indiscernible] (13:32)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. They were down sequentially.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Fair enough. I guess just borrowing that all up rolling into your growth outlook and expectation are pretty strong
seasonal quarter on – production wise, how either specific or otherwise is loan growth expectations for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jeff, I think that there's still a lot of liquidity out there and there's a lot of competition. I think we've always
been talking about mid-to high-single digits, I think that's a fair place to still project that out given everything that's
going on in the market. We've had had some new people that joined us back in the fourth quarter that we talked

about. We'll start to see some production ramping up from that team and we're working on other things as well.
But I think that mid-to high-single digits is the right place to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Switching gears a little bit to the margin. You mentioned premium amortization down linked quarter. Was
that still an expense or did that flip to recapture in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, that's still run as an expense. But it was down sequentially, probably around $5 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson &
Co.
Got it. And Aaron, if you look at net of PPP impact, the margin up 10 basis points linked quarter to 3.09%. What –
how does that compare to the March monthly average on margin that 3.09%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The sequential progression for the month when you back out kind of all the different ways, it was actually pretty
flat, but we didn't get the real benefit in the loan yields until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And the – and
so that's just now starting to come through. But I think what a good number to look at is where our tax-adjusted
loan coupon was ex-PPP and that was up 2 basis points sequentially to [ph] 3.84% from 3.82% (15:53). And
that's obviously very well poised to continue to see some nice lift here going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson &
Co.
Great. Thank you.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I just want to touch, just go back to the origination. It's great to see another record quarter. I just wanted to get a
sense of what you think is driving that. Is it – there's a lot of factors. Is it the improved economic backdrop? The
benefits from the new hires that we've talked about, less participations like you've mentioned moving upstream, I

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
suspect it's a combination of all that. But just curious of your thoughts on what's driving the improved originations.
And then I know you talked about the pipeline being full, but just in light of the record originations, how is the
pipeline trending quarter-over-quarter and just the composition of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. David, this is Chris. And I mean, you're right, it is a combination of all of that. But specifically, I'd say that it's
been a long time coming with our approach over the last couple of years of remaining open, being there for our
clients, and ultimately for prospects. So, we're winning new business that's coming from external to the bank
because of that approach. Our bankers have been in front of people, in front of our own clients. They're seeing
opportunities for strategic investments, things of that nature. It's fairly well balanced between true C&I and CRE
as well. Now, a little bit in the ag space and a little bit in construction as far as the new volume there. But honestly,
I think the approach and then when you look at the trending combination and you see not just our bankers, but
you see our clients looking at the potential of what's coming downstream to potentially do more for them, they're
voting on that aspect and signing up early. Some of them might be willing to go through a conversion and things
with of that nature. And I think that just bodes well for the process and what we've laid out there.
The new teams are starting to hit their stride. It takes a little time. The team that we announced that came on at
the end of the fourth quarter, they're about 90 days with us, we'll start to see some positive impact from them as
well. And then again, it's just kind of a normal aspect of where we've always been of being out in front of clients
and recognizing opportunities. I would also mention that we're seeing some positive uptick in the healthcare
space both regionally and nationally as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe just following up on the pricing front. Comparing the new production rates
quarter-over-quarter, they were up a couple basis points. Obviously, the rate hike came later in the quarter. But
just wanted to get a sense of how pricing and new loan yields are trending and then just any thoughts that you
might have on the competitive dynamics in the market today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think the competition has really changed much. We're still seeing some things where we're choosing
to walk away from long-term low fixed rates, things of that nature. We are seeing some improvement in the clients
that value the advice and what we're bringing to the table. We're seeing a little movement there. You're right. The
increase came late in the quarter. We'll see what takes place anything down the road, but I would expect this is
just kind of looking down the pipe that pricing competition is not going to let up, but the rising rates should give us
a little lift as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe shifting gears to the other side of the coin just talking on deposits. I
mean, core deposit growth has been phenomenal. You've got a tremendous low-cost core deposit base. Just
wanted to get a sense of how you think about deposit growth going forward in light of the rising rate environment.
Obviously, you have the benefit of being able to be pretty defensive on this just given the strength of your deposit
book. But how do you – I mean, do you expect deposit flows to at least slow or maybe migrate within the portfolio
or would you even expect maybe some outflows? Just any thoughts on trends with deposits would be helpful.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2022
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. This is Clint. Our crystal ball on that is a little fuzzy. Historically, the first half of any year has been
very little, if any, deposit growth. And the last two to three years, that hasn't been the case. And obviously posted
very strong deposit growth in the first quarter. And I think some of that is just our continued growth and some of
the market share that we've taken in certain areas that are less susceptible to seasonal fluctuations in deposits.
One of the things that we saw in the last rising rate cycle a few years ago was many of our customers with the
deposit mix we have been heavily weighted towards commercial and 50% non-interest-bearing gives us a
structural advantage. But for those that, that rate is meaningful, we pushed several hundred million dollars off
balance sheet during the last cycle through our CB Financial Services Group.
And so, we're able to still serve that client without cannibalizing the cost structure of our entire deposit base. And
so, those would be some of the strategies that we'll be leaning on Chris and the entire team to implement as we
go forward. So, if we see some declines in the deposits, my expectation is it's probably related to activities like
that more so than necessarily complete attrition leaving the bank.
And I'll turn over to Chris to see if he has anything else to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The only thing I'd really add there is our client base is not interest rate sensitive as some organizations.
And I think you've seen that over the historic performance of the cost of funds and such. The options that Clint
mentioned, we're already looking at some of those and we've seen a little bit of movement, but it's not enough at
this point to offset the growth that we had. And yeah – and I would say I think that Clint talks about the crystal ball,
I think every time we've said we kind of think that's going to be flat, we end up being wrong. So, it's really hard to
pinpoint and it is what I'm trying to say there, but we'll keep managing it very closely and keep a close eye on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. Just one quick follow on to that. Do you have a sense of how much was from existing clients versus
maybe new client that you brought in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A

No. I don't have that right here with me.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. Maybe a question just on the environment and how it's changed since the merger was
announced, more on the marks and the assumptions on the accretion from the deal. We've seen – I guess two

questions. Number one, we've seen a lot of banks move securities into held to maturity to avoid the hit to OCI. I
guess first question is, is that something with the combination that might be being considered? And two, how
might the marks changing from when the deal was announced impact capital return pro forma? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, Chris, this is Clint. I'll start just kind of high level and then I'll turn it over to Aaron for the actual substance
that you're looking for. Relative to how we think about the deal and the impact of rates and the marks, I'm
somewhat indifferent. The value that we saw in this combination was really executing on a shared long-term
vision and that long-term vision hasn't changed. The more that we've gotten into the integration planning, the
more excited I am about exceeding that vision. And I said long term, well, we've all been at this for the better part
of our careers and we've been through multiple business cycles. And that's something that as a combined
organization, we know we're going to go through. And it's just the timing of it. Our objective here wasn't trying to
time a business cycle or beat a rate movement or anything. It was the right time for us to consider this
combination.
So, what creates some noise in the modeling? I'll let Aaron speak to the work. I know Aaron and Ron and their
teams have put a tremendous amount into modeling and analyzing that impact. But I just wanted to kind of frame
it that I really look at that as kind of a short-term component of what really is a long-term decision that all of our
companies made.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And I would echo with what Clint has said on that front about staying focused on the fundamentals. But just
from the rate impact point, I guess the first point out that we did in fact move a good deal of our AFS portfolio into
held to maturity late last year in anticipation of rising rates and that helped give us a little bit of protection here as
rates have started to move. Going forward, I would expect that there'd be good rationale for continuing to hold
some of that there, but more specific to the marks as they will be impacted for the deal – we'll be looking at certain
asset categories that would have been coming on at a premium now swinging to a discount, that's going to
increase the amount of goodwill. But as Clint indicated, that's going to come back to us much faster in the form of
net interest income. So, net-net, it's an accounting change. The fundamentals are not really changed by those
interest rate movements.

That's great color. Thanks, Aaron.
