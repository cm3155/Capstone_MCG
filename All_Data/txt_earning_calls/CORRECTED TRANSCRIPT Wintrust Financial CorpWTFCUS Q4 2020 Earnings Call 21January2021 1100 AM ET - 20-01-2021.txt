Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
We have the same format as usual, where I'm going to give some general comments regarding our results. I'll
turn it over to Dave Dykstra for more detailed analysis, other income and other expenses and taxes. Back to me
for some summary comments and thoughts about the future, of course some time for questions.
And given all that 2020 brought to the table, I think Wintrust really had a remarkable year. Pre-tax, pre-provision
earnings increased 13%, which exceeded our 10-year CAGR which stood at 10%, not too shabby. I know that we
may not have beaten the analyst estimates this quarter for PPP income. We're much closer than you think
considering the – one time there's a $13 million and a $7 million of foregone income, when we made the decision
to keep 10% of mortgage production on our books, more on this later.
CECL required huge provisions, $214 million versus $54 million in 2019, an increase of $160 million. Meanwhile,
net charge-offs in 2020 were $40.3 million, $9.2 million less than the previous year. NPLs and NPAs as percent of
loans and assets, respectively reached 4 basis points lower than last year. Last year in and of itself was an
excellent credit year. They closed the year at 40 basis points and 32 basis points, respectively. One would think
there was even a crisis going on that I have to write a nice note to Moody's, FASB and AICPA and thank them for
putting CECL in when they did.
Asset, deposits and loan growth have all exceeded 10-year averages. Assets grew 23.2% versus a 12% CAGR
over 10 years. Loans grew 19.7% versus a 12% CAGR; and deposits, 23% during the year versus a 13% CAGR.
We now have over $45 billion in assets. Again, mortgage area hit the cover off the ball. By design, we hope it
would do that because when rates go low, we use the mortgages to cover so we can catch up on the margin side.
And what's most amazing is we accomplished this really by working remotely through the most part, taking 5,300
people and flipping to remote and being able to accomplish what we did, our asset growth, what we did with PPP
and the like is just incredible to me. Incredible – it just really is incredible. The entire Wintrust team showed great
strategic ability and it can do attitude that is unsurpassed. Couldn't be prouder of them and I told our board this
and truly was – 2021, I mean this – it really continues to be our finest hour.
On to some earnings statistics, $101.2 million for the year, down 6% from the fourth quarter but up 18% – sorry,
from the third quarter but up 18% from the same time last year. Earnings per share were $1.63, down 2% from
the first quarter – or from the third quarter and 13% from the fourth quarter last year. Year-to-date, we made $293
million at a $4.68 per share, down 22% mostly because of the huge CECL provision we had to take. Other than
that, we're in pretty good shape.
Pre-tax, pre-provision of $135 million or $604 million year-to-date was up over 9% over the same period last year
and 13% over the prior year. Net interest margin of 2.54% was down 3 basis points. However, the net interest
income was up $3 million as we had great loan growth in spite of the fact that – it didn't look like it, but we'll get
into that in a second, because of the first levels of PPP loans trying to get repaid or forgiven. Say, we had loans
breakeven, but really, core loans were up nicely during the period. I'll talk about that in a second.
ROE at 10.3% for the quarter, 12.95% for the year. [ph] ROE was 7.5% (00:05:55) for the year, return on tangible
equity for the full year, 9.54%. Overhead ratio was 112 basis points. That's compared to 87 basis points last
quarter, 153 basis points a year before, 105 basis points year-to-date. We would have probably been a lot lower
had we not had the one-timers, et cetera. But I think we feel pretty good about where we are in that regard. I'll talk
about it in a second. Tangible book value again grew nicely during the year, and again as we go through all the
time, that's one of our primary motivators is – our drivers is earnings growth, tangible book value growth and asset
growth.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
The margin was again affected by excess liquidity on our balance sheet. We began to do a number of things to
improve the NII and NIM. Some of these are listed below. Note that our goal is to maintain at a interest rate
sensitivity position throughout these efforts. Our goal is to maintain a GAAP of 12% to 15%. In other words, we
have to stay disciplined here and not go along and lock in the margin at these goofy rates. Our loan pipelines
remain consistently strong in all facets of the business.
We made a decision during the quarter to keep 10% of mortgage production on our books. It really beats buying
mortgage backs in this market. This did affect earnings in the quarter as we held actually $180 million on our
books in Q4. There's an 8 to 12-month breakeven point on holding versus selling in that we have to take all the
expenses related to the production up front and we'll get it back in the margin, which is probably a good thing, but
let's see.
We also pulled $272 million of mortgages from Ginnie Mae that were always on our books, [indiscernible]
(00:08:01) receive the earnings, earnings were going to these security holders and not us. We retained the
guarantee, but earned the income, so earning asset growth was actually – when you're thinking of it, earning
asset loan growth was actually up over $850 million during the quarter. Most of the growth took place towards the
end of the quarter. So, we have a really good head start going forward into this year.
We commenced investing on some liquidity assets of a longer duration. Currently, aggregate duration of our
liquidity portfolio is 1.3 years, so close to five to six-year duration we usually operate with. So, we have some
room to do some accretive investing without messing up the desired GAAP goals.
We also – I know we've been taking applications for PPP part 3 for over 10 days. Currently, we have applications
in the process of over 5,500, $1.175 billion. 30% have already been submitted to the SBA for approval.
[indiscernible] (00:09:09) these loans approximate $44 million. They amortize over the life of the loans to at least
through December of this year. Average ticket size of these loans is $214,000. The mean size is $72,000.
We really beat everybody in the market by almost 10 days and our decks are pretty clear right now. We've got this
down. And we hope to add more to this portfolio not just because we need it, but to help our clients out there who
need this to get through the last throngs of this current problem or crisis.
Apparently, not really the margin, but on the earning asset front, we did complete one round of branch retail –
round one of our branch retail rationalization approach. We sold three southwestern Wisconsin branches that is
not in our prime footprint and we recorded a small gain, approximately $4 million in quarter two 2021. We also
announced plans to close initial 10 branches and took a $1.4 million charge this quarter related to the closings.
These branches were all acquired over the years [ph] and were probably (00:10:21) needed due to – not to be
needed due to proximity to other Wintrust locations, so saving us probably $5 million, plus or minus, a year. It
should also be noted that we're down over 100 positions in retail due to attrition. We've now replaced the staff that
left. We believe there to be a like amount of additional excess capacity in our existing footprint due to continued
use of online services really brought about by the pandemic. These additional savings will offset the cost of
branches currently on the drawing board for 2021 and 2022.
I'm just a little bit worried that we're much bigger now and when we do – when life does get back to normal, we
really don't want to – we want to keep our service level enhanced. We don't want to bite to the bone right now. So,
we'll see where we go with it. We always continue to look for other additional efficiencies in the market. Also, in
quarter four, we started a stock purchase program, acquiring almost 925,000 shares in the quarter. Able to do this

in an average price that made the acquisition accretive to both earnings and tangible book value. We'll continue to
monitor for additional opportunities.
On the other income side, not to take Dave's thunder, but the mortgage area hit the cover off the ball all year.
Fourth quarter, as mentioned, indicated the start of our program, we're booking 10% of production on our books.
Hurts current earnings, but will be profitable over the long run. Wealth management also had a good year,
especially a good fourth quarter that we can build on going forward. Total assets under administration surpassed
$30 billion – $30.1 billion to be exact of growth. Growth of $1.19 billion in the quarter. Rebounding markets help,
but the majority of the growth was from new accounts, bodes well for the future.
On the balance sheet front, assets grew $1.350 billion. The average earning assets were up $937 million. Loans,
as we said earlier, without PPP, were up $606 million in all facets of the business. If you add back the Ginnie
Maes we bought back, really the hit on the books were made earning closer to [ph] $815 million (00:12:40) of
earning asset growth we had, the majority of which took place, as I mentioned, in the last part of the quarter,
really by almost $678 million plus the buyback of the Ginnies.
So, this really holds $678 million of average versus even, well, quarter-end in the fourth quarter. So, again, that's
a number plus the Ginnies that we started earning on in this quarter that bodes pretty well. Deposits were up $1.2
billion. That's after the repayment of $600 million of high plus institutional money we returned during the quarter.
So, again, we continue to grow through the cycle.
Loan-to-deposit ratio is 86.5%, down from 89% as the first round – first two rounds of PPP continue to pay off.
That's a good thing. Loan-to-deposits – loans and deposits, as I mentioned, loan growth was good across the
board and we feel good. But our pipelines are strong. We feel very good about where we are right now. And as
mentioned, deposit growth was extraordinary throughout the quarter and the year. And we hope to continue that
growth because that really is the franchise value of the company.
On the credit side, we discussed credit at the beginning of the presentation. Needless to say, the numbers, which
were good to begin with, have gotten even better. The pretty low provision we took of $1.18 million is not really a
reserve release, in my opinion, based on economic factors, but rather an indication of overall portfolio
improvement.
Through hard work of our credit team, $275 million of loans were upgraded and $40 million of nonaccruals paid
off. This was accomplished through portfolio sales, use of Fed's Main Street Lending product, successful
execution of lending exit strategies. We continue to cull the portfolio for cracks. If you understand that your first
loss is your best loss, we always look good on recovery.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave who's going to provide some additional detail on other income expenses and
taxes. Dave?

All right. Thanks, Ed. As usual, I'll briefly touch on the significant noninterest income and noninterest expense
sections that had changes from the prior quarter.
Starting with the net interest income section, our wealth management revenue increased $1.8 million to $26.8
million in the fourth quarter compared to $25 million in the third quarter of 2020 and up 7% from $25 million
5

recorded in the year-ago quarter. This revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations,
which impact the pricing of a portion of our managed asset accounts.
Mortgage banking revenue, as Ed referred to, was seasonally strong due to the continuing low interest rate
environment but declined 20% or $21.7 million to $86.8 million in the fourth quarter from the record level of $108.5
million posted in the prior quarter and was up a strong 81% from the $47.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of
last year. The company originated approximately $2.4 billion of mortgage loans for sale in the fourth quarter, a
record, up from approximately $2.2 billion in the prior quarter and up substantially from the $1.2 billion of loans
that we originated for sale in the fourth quarter of last year.
The decline in the category's revenue from the prior quarter resulted from, first, a decrease in the value of the
mortgage servicing rights related to the fair value model assumptions of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter as
compared to a decrease of $3.0 million in the prior quarter, and a drop of approximately $0.5 billion in the pipeline
of mortgages being originated for sale, including a reduction of approximately $200 million that the company has
earmarked to be originated and held for investment during the first quarter of 2021.
The company is required to record the value of the mortgage-related derivatives related to loans in the pipeline at
quarter end that are estimated to close and to be sold. As such, when the pipeline of the loans declines, the
revenue declines accordingly. Similarly, if the pipelines of loans for sale increases, then we would see associated
increases in net revenue. So, the reduction of the pipelines like $500 million sacrifices revenue in the current
quarter.
And, as Ed mentioned, that revenue should be recognized through net interest income going forward. Likewise,
we retained $192 million of mortgage loans on our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, and we also sacrificed the
revenue on those loans in the current quarter, but, again, should recognize the revenue through the margin going
forward. So, approximately $192 million that we kept on the books and $200 million that was in the pipeline that
we sacrificed the revenue on the current quarter for the benefit of future quarters.
While the mortgage revenue declined, it remains a very strong quarter for our mortgage banking business. We
currently expect originations in the first quarter to be very strong, again, due to the continuation of the refinance
activity and a strong committed pipeline.
Table 16 of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation of all the components of the origination volumes,
the mortgage servicing right capitalization, servicing cost, et cetera, but again a record quarter. In total, we
recorded or originated $2.5 billion of loans that closed either for sale or that we kept on our balance sheet.
Other noninterest income totaled $19.7 million in the fourth quarter, up approximately $6.4 million from the $13.3
million recorded in the prior quarter. The primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category included
$901,000 of higher swap fee revenue and $2.6 million of higher income investments and partnerships, which are
primarily related to SBIC investments to support CRA purposes.
Additionally, BOLI income was up approximately $1.6 million from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $0.9
million of higher earnings on BOLI investments that support deferred compensation benefit plans, which were
positively impacted by the equity market returns, and also a net $0.9 million debt benefit that we recorded during
the quarter. I should note that the $0.9 million of increase related to the deferred compensation plan would show a
similar increase in expenses. So, the amounts, in essence, offset each other between the other income and the
compensation expense by $0.9 million.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jan-2021
Turning to the noninterest expense categories, noninterest expenses totaled $281.9 million for the fourth quarter,
up approximately $17.6 million or 7% from the $264.2 million recorded in the prior quarter. There are a handful of
categories that account for the increase that I will focus on. First, the salary employee benefits expense category
increased approximately $7.1 million in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter.
The salary expense component of that category was up approximately $3.7 million. The primary cause of the
increase related to increased staffing to support the overall increase in mortgage originations and technology-
related staffing to support our ongoing development of enhanced digital products and capabilities. The reported
amounts also saw the increase in the deferred compensation expense of a net $0.7 million that was impacted by
the BOLI returns that I previously discussed.
Turning to commissions and incentive comp, that category is up $3.9 million in the fourth quarter relative to the
third quarter with that change being driven largely by the additional commissions related to the higher amount of
closed mortgages and slightly higher wealth management brokerage trading activity, as well as a little bit of higher
incentive compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter. You have to remember that the commissions
expense on mortgages are paid when the mortgage loan is closed. And we had record closings in the current
quarter that exceeded the prior quarter where its revenue is also recorded on the pipelines. So, a little bit of a
disconnect there, but higher commissions due to higher closings.
Offsetting the aforementioned increases in employee benefits was a decrease in employee benefits of
approximately $520,000 from the prior quarter due to a slight decrease in employee insurance claims and a
slightly lower level of payroll taxes.
Equipment expense totaled $20.6 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.3 million as compared to the prior
quarter total of $17.3 million. The increase was due to increased software licensing expenses including some
increases related to online mortgage usage, PPP loan servicing enhancements, network upgrades to support our
growth, and digital enhancements and various other software upgrades as well as the write-off of certain software
systems that had been retired early as a result of our implementation of certain new systems. We continue to
invest in software and technology to enhance our customer delivery system and products as well as invest in our
systems to support our continued growth.
Occupancy expense totaled $19.7 million on the fourth quarter, increasing $3.9 million. The increase was due to
the $1.4 million impairment charge associated with the planned closures of the 10 branches that Ed referred to,
increased real estate tax assessments from the prior quarter, and a higher level of utility charges.
Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $2 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter.
This was primarily related to increased digital advertising campaigns and community impact and sports
sponsorship spending as various community-based sports venues have begun to increase their events again.
In summary, if you look at this and add up the components, there was roughly $11 million of the increase relates
to mortgage activity, including $6.6 million of an additional earn-out on the mortgage acquisitions we had and
roughly $4.5 million of increased salary and benefit costs for the record level of mortgage closings during the
quarter.
So, we would expect that to decrease in the future quarters as the pipelines are down. And we believe we won't
have any significant additional contingent consideration going forward. And we had the $1.4 million of branch
closures. So, between those items, that's roughly 12-plus million dollars of expenses that were related to the
mortgage and/or branch closures that we would expect to decline in the future quarters.

So, other than those expense categories, no other expense categories had any significant change from the
amounts recorded in the third quarter. Ed mentioned that our net overhead ratio was 1.12%, was up slightly from
the third quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, the net overhead ratio was 1.05% and down 52 basis points from
the 1.57% recorded in 2019.
And, with that, I will throw the discussion back over to Ed.

Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dave. 2020 was a pretty interesting and challenging year to say the least. In some respects, it's a very
rewarding year. That being said, it would be nice to return to some degree of normalcy. We always, in the
company, our mascot is Sisyphus. And remember what Sisyphus – I think I said this before on earlier calls – that
he pushed the rock up the hill every day and every night it would fall down and he had to push it up the next day.
On 12/31 every year, I tell everybody listen for the rock falling down, we got to push it back up. We're well on our
way of pushing it up this year. I think we're very well positioned to start 2021 in a very good place. We have to
take what the market gives us, and we need to grow through this low interest rate period, invest in a way that
maintains an above normal interest rate sensitivity position, maintains our always conservative credit standards.
Earlier we discussed all levers we're pulling to increase earnings and the margin. Loan pipelines remain strong
and PPP round three give us an unexpected lift for the year. We continue to cull the portfolio for problem credits
to improve on our already stellar credit statistics. We will also continue to find other cost-saving ideas. However,
we're always going to invest in the business. Not to do so would be absolutely fatal. Capital levels remain at more
than adequate levels.
The expansion front, a number of new branches planned for the next 24 months into areas we do not currently
serve. On the acquisition front, we continue to search out deals in all areas of our business. The recent rebound
in our stock price, we would now have currency to use in deals. Remember how much we abhor dilution. So, it's
nice to get a little bit of currency back. You can be assured of our consistent conservative approach on potential
deals.
I wanted to end by saying 2021 marks our 30th year in business. On December 27, 2021, we will hit the 30-year
anniversary opening our first bank. We've come a long way from the card tables and beer, 1,100 square feet and
11 employees, but we've never lost sight of our basic operating principles. This has served us well.
It's kind of funny, I think there's a reasonable chance that we could hit $50 billion in 30 years. I can assure you
that 30 years ago, this was never in our wildest dreams, but it's kind of cool if you think about it. As always, you
can be assured of our best efforts. We appreciate your support.
Now, we can go over to questions if there are any out there.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good, doing well, doing well. A question on the decision to put some mortgages on the balance sheet, can
you just – I'm not critical of it, but talk a little bit about that decision strategically, why you did it, what you're putting
on the balance sheet, and how far you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we're going to stay within that 10% to 15% GAAP position that we always desire. But I don't want to go out
and buy a bunch of mortgage backs at 1.40% when I can get – keep jumbo loans on the books at 3% to 3.25%. I
know it's got a payback of call it a year, but why not? We have to put this liquidity to work. These are very good
deals. The returns are pretty good on them.
We probably gave up between the $200,000 that we booked this quarter, $200,000 next quarter, gave up
probably $8 million in revenue [ph] to get your (00:29:33) 4% production margin or – $400,000 will be more than
that, be a lot more at $16 million, maybe $13 million, $14 million we're going to add in additional revenue this
quarter. Certainly would have kept everybody happy on the PPP front. But it just makes sense that rather than go
out and do it that way, we can book them and put them in the margin and make some money as opposed to
buying mortgage backs at half the price.

And, Jon, as Ed mentioned, we're targeting maybe 10% of our production. So, it hurts a little bit, but we're not
doing like half of our production. But it still provides a long-term benefit and an earning lever to use going forward,
although it sacrifices current quarter revenue.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Right. Okay. And then, Dave, just sticking on mortgage, I know this kind of comes up every quarter, but talk
a little bit about maybe your near-term expectations for volumes. And maybe this matters more than ever, but just
remind us of your ability to accordion some of the mortgage expenses if volumes do really continue to come down
in 2021. And is that something we should be concerned about for the bottom line? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we'll have to see where applications come in. The pipelines are down $0.5 billion. So, if you look at that
and say, between investments and closings we did $2.5 billion, we'll probably be $2 billion, plus or minus, as far
as [ph] reduction (00:31:27) in the first quarter. And then, quite frankly, we have to see what the spring buying
season is like. Second quarter could be more than. But I think, all in, including investments and for sale, $2 billion,
plus or minus, is reasonable. So, we still think it's going to be a strong quarter.
A lot of the increase in the salaries expense related to temporary and contract workers. So, that goes to your
accordion. Those can go up and down rather quickly. And so, I think we can accordion the expenses well and we
manage for that. We're focused on that. Unfortunately, the pipeline and the production has been strong recently,
so we haven't had to do this. It's more of an issue of do we have enough people to process record volumes of
production.
And so, we added this quarter to it because we did have record production volume quarter and record [ph]
accordion (00:32:31). We do think we can [ph] accordion well (00:32:34). We do think the volume will be strong in
the first quarter, not quite as strong as $2.5 billion all-in closings we did this quarter, but still historically a very
strong quarter.

Okay. Sorry about that, little mute button. My apologies. Maybe start with the net interest margin. Could you just
talk about the outlook for the margin with and without kind of PPP fees? And then a couple of times you've
mentioned that 15- to 30-basis-point margin expansion as you kind of redeploy that excess liquidity and just over
the next 12 months the opportunity to achieve that NIM expansion through that event.

Well, it'll depend really on loan growth and deposit – well, deposit costs still have room to come down. That's
going to happen. The loan growth is going to happen, but what it really depends on is we figure we can put $1
billion to $1.5 billion worth of work in the investment portfolio. So, we're going to lag that in though because rates
seem like they're going up, and why put it all on now, why not hedge or bet a little. I mean, I think they'll go up
before they go down.
So, I think you got to deal with those numbers we gave you. It might be a little bit more staccato than you'd like,
but we'll take advantage what the market gives us. And I think that the next quarter you should start seeing some
benefit of it depending on where LIBOR goes. We think we'll be in pretty good shape. But I can't give you more
than that just because I gave you all the tools, the levers were pulling, just a timing issue. And we gave you the
ranges of where it's going to come, but I don't want to be totally specific because it's all a function of where market
rates are, where we think they're going, and we don't want to lock in this margin but we do want to leave room for
expansion.
So, like, today, I think we put about $600 million to work, and that's a fair number in the first quarter and it'll go to
work in the first quarter. Of the $1.5 billion, we think we have to play within the investment portfolio and we'll see
where it goes from there.
Dave, you got any other comment on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. The thing I would say, Terry, is that I think the margins basically bottomed out though. It went down a few
basis points this quarter, but we have significant liquidity come in again, so that you're earning 12 basis points or
13 basis points on. So, barring additional significant liquidity coming in, which I think might have a little pressure if
that happens. But we think the margins really bottomed out and the margin goes up from here as we do the
investments that Ed talked about. And the new PPP loans will come in to help offset the runoff of the old PPP
loans. And I think we're in pretty good shape.
And I think the margin has really bottomed out here, and barring some big swing in the curve environment, that
would be negative to us if the curve flattened even more and went inverted, but we don't expect that. We think the
margins bottomed out and we have lots of lever. I think that's one of the great stories that we have here is we
have a lot of liquidity to put to use and there's an earnings lever there. And we believe we bottomed out and now
it's just trying to time how and when to put liquidity to work.

Thank you. And then just as a follow-up question, the advertising and marketing costs lower this year because of
just the pandemic. And I believe earlier you mentioned stadium, sporting events starting to open up again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Could you just talk about kind of your thoughts for 2021 on that line? I don't want to be surprised assuming they
go back to more normal levels, which a year ago, in the fourth quarter, was $12.5 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, it just all depends on when people are allowed back in stadiums. We cut deals. Said no one was in
the stadium, we shouldn't have to pay as much we pay in the past on tickets and ticket issues and the like. But
with the onset of the – being able to go get the shots, I think by June or July we're going to have people in there.
So, I don't know if it's going to be as high as it was in our highest years. We are still obligated to pay it if it is, but I
just don't think you're going to have fans in the stands for half the year, in which case it'll be less. What can I say?
I mean, just follow the baseball. Baseball is our biggest cost. And if there aren't fans in the stands, we don't have
to pay as much. And basketball the same thing, we have Northwestern, Marquette and DePaul, and with no fans
in the stands, we don't have to pay as much. So, because they're playing, it'll be more than last year, but less than
our high points. Does that make sense?

Hey. Good morning. David, I just want to go back to the question on the mortgages you put on the balance sheet.

Why don't we let Murph do that>
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Chris, as you'd probably have seen from other banks right now on credit quality through our bank and also
through our warehouse customers has really never been better. I mean, if you look at average [ph] empirical
scores, I mean, things – the max [ph] (00:39:25) obviously got tighter over the last number of years. But what
we're seeing right now is just outstanding credit quality. So, I feel very good about holding these on our balance
sheet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Are these conforming? Are these some sort of – you said they're jumbo. Are they prime? Are they sort of like Alt-A
characteristics to them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, these are all prime jumbos.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Cool. And then just another question tying growth into capital. I guess I was positively surprised you
bought back stock in the quarter. Maybe you could speak to expectations going forward. I've always kind of
viewed yourselves as more optimized capital versus massive excess, but interested in your thoughts with the
pandemic easing a bit. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we really like – we don't like dilution at all. We love the accretive aspects of what we've done to-date. I
mean, being able to buy below tangible book value. And in terms of helping earnings, it all worked. But now the
stock price is up, it's a little tougher, but you never know with what's going on in the world, [ph] if we're (00:40:36)
down again. We're prepared to buy it back. We hate dilution. We abhor dilution. We want to be accretive. So, as
long as it makes good sense, we'll buy some. We still have some capacity to buy now on the existing authority.
Dave, how much do we have?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes. So, our initial authority was $125 million and we bought back $92 million to-date. In the first quarter of 2020,
we did $37 million and then in the fourth quarter of 2020 we did $54.9 million, so a total of $92 million out of that
program. So, we have $32.9 million left that we could do.
But, as Ed said, we tried to be opportunistic and buy it. Generally, our average price on this in the fourth quarter
was $56 a share. So, we'll monitor the price. We'll look at what other opportunities are out there for capital
deployment as far as the growth and the like and play it by ear.

And then maybe one more if I could. Obviously, there's a big merger in the Midwest with Huntington and TCF.
Obviously, TCF Chicago is a little bit different, but interested in any potential opportunities from dislocation either
from that or from Fifth Third's deal a couple of years back. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Oh, dislocate, we love it when that happens. Dislocation is our middle name. With the Huntington deal, TCF was
not that really that strong in Chicago with most of their locations being in grocery stores. Not really our cup of tea.
Recall TCF was a – years ago was the fee king of the world and we don't play that game. So, really, those
customers are welcome in our place, but I don't think they'll care. It's just going to be a product sort of thing and
we'll see where that goes.
The other side, the disruption caused by Fifth Third buying MB is still ongoing. And we've hired a number of their
bankers and we're getting good business from them. We actually started a new currency division that's coming
from them. It's a business indirectly and has – well, very directly in our previous group Dave and Murph and I
were all involved with. We were the largest in the Chicago Fed district in terms of handling these guys. When MB
bought Corus, it was not – they took it. Now, Fifth Third didn't want it. So, that business is up for grabs. We hired
good people from them, very profitable business. So, it's not just the business you pick up, it's the lines of
business you can pick up, too, which is kind of interesting.
So, disruption is good. There's recently announced $1.2 billion local bank in a market we compete being bought
by a downstate Illinois bank. That'll be an opportunity for us. So, we love the disruption. We love to take
advantage of it. Right now, we're excited about our prospects in the PPP world. We really have – the way our
system works opening up really before anybody else in the market with flawless execution, it really goes from
soup to nuts very quickly.
Actually, we're seeing a lessened demand from our customers now, trying to outreach the prospects and to – well,
we've always done for low to moderates. The low to moderate side of the equation, we're running local workshops
to where people come in and actually do their applications with a proctor kind of there to answer questions and
help them get through it. But we think that the halo effect from the previous PPP 1 and 2 hopefully will carry over
into this one.
And our decks are pretty well cleared because of the efficiency and the hard work of our people, getting them
cleared, it's been awesome. So, there's a lot of disruption, a lot of opportunity in the market. As I said, our
pipelines are extremely full. It's coming from someplace. We're not making it up, it's not expansion just by it. So
we continue to take business from our competitors.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Hi, Nathan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just going back to that last point, Ed, on PPP. I guess, with the third round opening up here recently, what are
your expectations in terms of volumes coming out of that over the next quarter or two?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we're already at, what I say, $1.175 billion. I think that there's still some room there if it goes to $1.5 billion or
$2 billion. It gets kind of funky where we don't really open it up in general because of the fraud aspects. I think
knowing your customer is important. We have so many on the prospect list so that we do know for one – in one
shape or form or another that – we're now in the outreach. We're calling people and ask them about it for the
prospects and existing customers we think are eligible who haven't taken advantage of it, prospects. And
certainly, the low to mods, we're working very hard on those.
So, I would think we could be anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion. If we're at $1.1 billion now, I think $1.4
billion, $1.5 billion on the low side, $2 billion on the high side will be a good number. Just depends how long it
goes and if they restock it with money or not. SBA is being kind of funky and feels over $2 million or – because if
you're – if you never drew on the first one, for the second one you go up to $10 million in this, if you want. But
you're being kind of strange on the larger deals where they're pulling them in advance if it's the second round.
Murph, do you want to talk about that a little?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. You hit it right on the head. We're just getting some interesting feedback from the SBA as it relates to some
of these larger borrowers. I think there's going to be a heightened audit attention placed on these. And with the
transition going on in Washington right now, it's a little bit up in the air.
But generally speaking, I mean, I think, as it relates to volumes, I mean, Ed is right. I mean, we've seen a
tremendous amount of growth early on in this latest round by those highly affected customers. And it's obviously
good from outstandings and some of the fee recognition. But kind of, most importantly, it's just we're seeing these
customers who have really been pounded over the course of the last 10 months getting some help here. It's just –
it's really great to see this from just watching them and then watching our own portfolio...

Got it. That's helpful. And kind of changing gears along those lines, if you'd back out PPP, it looks like loans are
up 10% year-over-year in 2020. With onboarding more production on the residential side in 2021, what are your
kind of growth expectations in 2021, keeping in mind the hires and so forth that...

...Tim, do you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Vice Chairman-Lending, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, yeah, I would just say, just in general, our guidance has kind of been that mid to high-single-digit growth
over a number of years here. And going into this year, I think we were thinking that it was going to be a – maybe
one of the more challenging years to get that. Fortunately, it's just – we have so many different loan engines that
we utilize. And if you take a look at this year, we saw every one of them really have a pretty solid year.
So, the premium finance group got just a spectacular year. CRE had a good first half of the year. C&I had a great
second half of the year. So, it's really one of the benefits of having this more granular approach to portfolio
growth. So, I look at this year coming up and based on the pipelines and based on the feedback that we're getting
from the business leaders, we should be pretty much right back at that mid to high-single-digit growth rate. So,
obviously a lot depends on how the economy continues to rebound, but overall feeling pretty good.

No. I think Rich covered it. But we do believe the PPP process will continue to yield good prospects for us and
that will help us get to those numbers, so nothing to add otherwise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Great. If I could just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Tim, it also seems that there – as these shots start to – I'm getting my shot on Monday, by the way. I'm an old guy
getting my shot. So, as that starts happening, there's so much pent-up demand. I think it's going to explode. If you
ever try to buy a refrigerator or any sort of hard asset right now, it takes forever to get it because inventories are
so low. You're going to see the inventory build coming up. They'll require – [ph] we wouldn't (00:51:03) even
consider what's going on there.
They'll require probably more line usage. Our line usage stay at 49% and 50%. But I think you may see a little bit
more coming with the – but I think we're going to roll out of this thing come June and July when we get the herd
immunity if everything works right. So who knows? I think notwithstanding that, we're going to be on high-single
digits this year based on all the information we have right now. But it's just going to enhance it, I think.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And if I could just ask one more on expenses, just trying to put together all those items that were
discussed earlier, the MBA is forecasting volumes to be down 20%, 22% this year and with advertising spend
perhaps not likely to get back to full run rate levels. And then you've got the branch consolidations and closures
and the contingent consideration perhaps going away entirely. I mean, is it fair to expect expenses versus 2020 to
be up low-single digit or flattish, any thoughts just overall along those lines?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, still, a lot of it really depends on where that mortgage number comes out at. But if you followed the MBA
forecast, then all else sort of being equal, it's probably mid-single digit expense growth is sort of where I would
expect this to come out because we do some salary increases and we are growing and we are investing in digital
improvements, et cetera. So, mid-single digits is about right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. That's very helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I – one thing to keep in mind is we did double up on the – with the mortgage sales by keeping 10% of the books
this quarter and taking 10% out of the next quarter with all the expenses and all the revenue of that. So, a little bit
wild there, too. But I don't think expenses are as bad as everybody thinks they are. Take the one-timers plus that
little move we made, it's a timing issues with a lot of it. But we shall see.

What's up, Mike? Is everything good?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah, yeah, doing well. Just wanted to ask maybe kind of a higher level question. You've in the past kind of
referred people to the net overhead ratio to kind of balance growth and investment with earnings and profitability.
Is that still kind of how you're thinking in managing the business, obviously, coming out of kind of this fog of war, if
you will, where do you think we can get to on that ratio if that's still the right ratio to look at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Oh, yes, I think it is. We're fortunate to have the – why we have the mortgage business, well, we invest in this for
times is exactly like this. When rates go down, it can pick it up for us. That certainly helps that overhead ratio. We
look at almost equaled what the runoff of the margin was. But there'll be a period of time in there where we're
going to get kind of an influx here of – there'll be influx where the – it's got to go up and the margin will be moved.
We hope to have the margin moving as fast. We shall see. But we always say less than 1.5 was good. We've
lowered that down to 1. But with our size down about 1.35 – 1.25 to 1.35 would be a good number for us.
In the budget, it's what? Tim, do you remember?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy S. Crane A
President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We typically don't give out budget numbers. But I think in a sort of a more normal mortgage market, I think
in the 1.30s is probably where we would think we could be given the current environment. We're better than that
18


Wintrust Financial Corp.

right now because mortgage is so strong. But if mortgages fall off, then I think you probably – we – our target was
1.50 before. We've grown so much. We think that's probably in the 1.30s now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We would hope that, if we go up 30 basis points, the margin goes up 30 basis points, too. That's kind of the
– how we work it. You can follow the math there, pretty easy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, you've kind of mentioned efforts to cut some branches. You still have kind
of the multiple bank subsidiaries. Would there be any opportunities to consolidate maybe one or two of those? I
know you've used it as part of the wealth strategy in the past. And you haven't thought that made sense. But in
this environment, have things changed at all there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Everything is open. But right now, we're very happy with where we are. that overhead ratio, if – let's put it this
way. It's not just a cost issue because the costs are minimal. As you think about everything behind the scenes, it's
already consolidated and runs that way. It's strictly a morale and a marketing issue for us, plus the ability to get
low-cost deposits with our ability to offer 50 times FDIC coverage.
Would we consider merging some together? Yes. That would come I think with geographic expansion. If we're
going to move out of the Chicago area, which we probably have to happen in the next two or three or four years,
we probably would start collapsing charters here. And I like the number 15. It's nice to have people who know the
markets running their shops and feeling good about it. So, yeah, we could do it. But I think it would be a function
of expansion out of our current market area. Would we want to keep a charter in a different area? Yeah, we
would. It's just – it would be a function of growth where you can get down to it, but nothing on the horizon now. I
mean, we're growing awfully fast. We're doing pretty well. The credit is good. Why would you just try to screw it
up?
