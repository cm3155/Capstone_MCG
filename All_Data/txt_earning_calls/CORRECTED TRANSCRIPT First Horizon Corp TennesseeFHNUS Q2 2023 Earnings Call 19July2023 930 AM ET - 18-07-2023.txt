Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Carla. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. It's been a few

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We're pleased to
announce our second quarter results. It'd be an understatement to say that 2023, especially the second quarter,
has been unusual, both for our company and the industry as a whole. I'm incredibly proud of the tremendous
resilience our company and associates have shown. Despite some of the unprecedented events in the banking
sector, we continue to focus on serving our clients and communities, and the results of those efforts are reflected
in our strong quarterly results.
On slide 5, you'll find some of the key highlights from this quarter, which Hope will provide more detail on later. On
an adjusted basis, we delivered EPS of $0.39 per share and a return on tangible common equity of 14.6%, while
maintaining robust capital levels. We ran a very successful deposit campaign. Our bankers made over 50,000
prospecting calls to new and existing clients, bringing in almost 6 billion in new to bank clients and growing our
client base by 4%. Credit performance continues to be strong, with non-performing loans declining $21 million
from the first quarter and net charge-offs of 16 basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range. Our
capital position is very strong with CET 1 increasing 72 basis points to 11.1%.
Though the industry is facing headwinds from increased deposit competition, macroeconomic uncertainty and
impending regulatory change, I am confident in our ability to earn top quartile returns through the cycle. Our
commitment to prudently managing interest rate risk, liquidity and credit has positioned us well to navigate the
current environment. Our business model is diversified by industry, geography and product, which provides
consistent returns and greater ability to manage through a range of market conditions.
We are investing in our people and infrastructure to enhance our products and services so that we can take
advantage of the opportunities we see in our attractive footprint. Our associates have gone above and beyond
serving our clients during these uncertain times. A benefit of the disruption in the second quarter was the
opportunity it provided our associates for proactive outreach to our clients. As you can see, the extraordinary
results of this effort, and I'm grateful for the confidence our clients have demonstrated in us this quarter. As we
move forward, I'm very thankful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to deliver
value for our clients, communities and shareholders.
With that, let me hand the call over to Hope to run through the financial results and our outlook. Hope?

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6, we have the highlights on our adjusted financials
and key performance metrics for the quarter. As interest rates have risen over the past year, our net interest
margin has expanded significantly up 64 basis points. Despite some moderation this quarter, the margin
continues to be very strong at 3.38%, and our balance sheet remains asset sensitive. Adjusted fee income and
expenses were both essentially flat to the prior quarter after netting the offsetting impact of deferred
compensation. Credit quality continues to remain very strong. Provision expense this quarter was $50 million,
resulting in an ACL coverage ratio of 1.35%, flat to the prior quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Tangible book value per share of $11.50 is up $0.61. The Series G conversion added $0.50; the merger
termination fee added $0.23, after netting out the $50 million foundation contribution; adjusted earnings added
$0.39, partially offset by our common dividend of $0.15. The mark-to-market on the securities portfolio and
hedges drove a $0.27 reduction.
On slide 7, we outline the notable items in the quarter, which netted to $98 million after-tax impact or $0.17 per
share. Our pre-tax notable items include the merger termination fee of $225 million; merger-related expenses of
$30 million, primarily related to the employee retention awards, which remain in place following the termination.
Other notable items include a $50 million contribution to the First Horizon Foundation, as well as a $15 million
derivative valuation adjustment related to prior Visa Class B sales.
On slide 8, you can see that over the last year we've benefited from our asset sensitive position with a net interest
margin expanding 64 basis points year-over-year. The positive response from clients to our deposit campaign this
quarter exceeded our expectations. We brought in $5.8 billion of new to bank funds from the more than 50,000
customers, which brings our ending deposit balances up 3% year-to-date. The positive deposit momentum
modestly accelerated the timing of the increase in deposit betas. However, our net interest margin of 3.38%
continues to be very strong despite some moderation in the quarter. As marginal funding costs have risen, loan
spreads have also widened out, with new production spreads approximately 50 basis points higher than we were
seeing in the fourth quarter.
On slide 9, you can see the success of our deposit campaign, demonstrating the confidence our clients have in
our franchise. We grew period-end deposits by 6%, added over 32,000 new clients to the bank and deepen
relationships with almost 19,000 of our existing clients. Our competitive offer and targeted client outreach
generate historically strong acquisition, with 60% of balances coming from new to bank clients. This deposit
campaign provide a great opportunity to connect with our clients.
Our bankers made proactive outreach calls and the clients who took advantage of the deepening offer increased
their balances with us by 37% on average. Mix shift continued into the second quarter, with non-interest bearing
balances declining from pandemic highs. We are beginning to see signs and the pace of that mix shift is starting
to slow down and DDA balances are stabilizing in the second half of the quarter. Non-interest bearing balances at
29% still comprise a higher proportion of total deposits today than pre-pandemic, which was 27%. Like a lot of
banks, we saw clients looking to maximize coverage on their deposits, driving higher utilization of our
collateralized repo suite product. In addition to the $4 billion of deposit growth, we added $782 million of repo
balances, which are incremental funding.
On slide 10, we show the trends in our loan portfolio, with loans up 3% on average and 4% at period end. Growth
was diversified across our markets and portfolio types. Loans to mortgage companies grew $650 million from first
quarter's seasonal lows. This is a great business for us. It's our highest yielding business line. And as others have
pulled back in this space, we've been able to deepen our relationships, widen spreads, and negotiate for more
deposit business. We also had growth in our CRE portfolio, which was primarily driven by fund-ups on existing
loans, primarily in our multi-family space.
We cover our fee income trends on slide 11. Overall, fee income has remained stable for several quarters,
despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting fixed income and mortgage. We had $5 million of increases in
deferred compensation, which is offset in expense. We saw $8 million of growth in other fees, partially driven by
higher Treasury management fees due to the decline in non-interest bearing deposit and seasonal factors.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
On slide 12, we review our expense trends. We have maintained expense discipline across the company as
evidenced in our results with adjusted expenses down $1 million, when you exclude the $5 million increase in
deferred compensation. The advertising investments made this quarter were to support our client promotions,
brand awareness initiatives and client outreach programs. Other expenses declines include $2 million of lower
fraud losses from implementation of additional security solutions, as well as lower franchise and realty tax
expenses related to the disposal of properties.
Turning to slide 13, I'll cover asset quality and reserves. Credit quality continues to be strong, with non-performing
loans down $21 million from the prior quarter, and net charge-offs remained near historic lows. We had $50
million of provision expense, resulting in a reserve build of $27 million, supporting 3% loan growth, excluding
loans to mortgage companies. Our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 1.35%, flat to the prior period. If
the industry experiences a credit cycle, we expect our portfolio to outperform due to the benefit of operating in
attractive markets, underwriting loans for all stages of the credit cycle and the granular diversification across
industries and portfolio types.
Turning to capital on slide 15, our capital position is very strong with CET 1 ratio of 11.1%, up 72 basis points.
The Series G conversion added 71 basis points; the termination fee added 19 basis points, net of the Foundation
contribution; we accretively deployed 30 basis points of capital into loans, including $16 million of lower risk loans
to mortgage companies. CET 1 would still be 9.5%, well above the 7% well-capitalized threshold, even adjusting
for the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio.
On slide 16, we've reaffirmed our full year guidance, which remains unchanged from what we shared with you at
Investor Day in early June. As we're all experiencing, there's been a lot of volatility in the market expectations for
interest rates. Our current outlook is for 25 basis point rate hike in July and then rates flat through the rest of the
year. The positive deposit momentum modestly accelerated the timing of the increases in deposit betas and we
remain asset sensitive. We still expect our NII guidance to be in range with what we provided at Investor Day. We
continue to invest in our businesses and our expense outlook reflects the impact of those investments as well as
the remaining retention awards moving into core expenses. We are pleased with the momentum we had this
quarter and are excited to continue to deliver on the strength of our franchise.
To wrap up on slide 18, we are well-positioned to capitalize on our diversified business model, highly attractive
markets and asset-sensitive balance sheet. As we continue to prudently manage capital and risk, we are
committed to delivering top quartile returns through the cycle. I am proud of the work our team has accomplished
over the last few years and especially as the last few months. We have built a balance sheet that we believe in
and have demonstrated our ability to execute even in challenging times.
And with that, I'll give it back to Bryan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. We strongly believe our second quarter results reflect the strength of our franchise. Our
associates accomplished a lot in the last 60 or so days. Their dedication, combined with our attractive footprint
and extraordinary client base, sets us up to build an unparalleled banking franchise in the south. We have long
tenured relationships that are broad and deep. We have an established team, who are excited about the
opportunities that we have to deliver value-added advice to clients with improved product and technology. I am
confident that we are well on the way to becoming a top performing regional bank and delivering enhanced
returns to our shareholders.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
This concludes our prepared remarks. Carla, we'll now open it up for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Markets. Your
line is now open. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. A question on deposit pricing expectations. Curious if you see them changing at all? You alluded to a
slowing non-interest bearing migration, can you talk a little bit about that? And then on your deposit campaign, do
you need to do more or is that essentially over at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Jon. Thank you for the first question. Good to hear from you again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
On the deposit campaign, we did have a promo rate that ran through June 30. That promo rate has expired and
we have gone out with a new third quarter promo rate, which is much more. We do expect to continue to need to
raise deposits in the industry, but we don't expect to have to run the aggressive campaign we did in May and
June. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned to grow our deposit base, especially in – deepening
relationships with the new clients we brought on board.
As far as the DDA, we really saw in the second half of the quarter almost no migration. Coming out of the
beginning of the year and especially in March and April, we saw significant focus by clients on moving DDA into
interest bearing as they became aware of how lucrative that is and the outreach calls that we were all doing
during that time as a result of the failures in the industry. And so, we believe the 29% that we're at now has been
stable for second half of the quarter, will remain stable as those are really operating accounts and there's not
much more that can migrate into interest bearing.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very helpful. And then, can you touch on the pricing pressures on some of the larger depositors? You
touched on it at Investor Day, but are you seeing that ease at all with some of the bigger deposit balances?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I would say, in June, we, definitely towards the end of the quarter, saw not the significant pressure we were
seeing. I think a lot of people settled down had changed. Banks already moved their money or starting to see a
little bit more normal size bidding in the industry as well as clients not looking to move money as quickly as they
were following the three bank failures.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, I'd add the following, which is, I think where you'll see more pressure in the coming quarters, not that it's
going to be easy anywhere, but more on the commercial lending side is, as you look at commercial lending
transactions, the entire industry is looking to deepen and broaden relationships. You're seeing that in
participations and club deals. You're seeing that in syndicated transactions. And I think you'll see more of the
pressure emerging on the commercial side in all likelihood in the back half of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, you're saying tied to – more tied to credit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Yeah. More than just a credit transaction, it's a relationship.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll step back in the queue. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, just maybe following up on some of Jon's questioning on – it
sounds like the DDA is near bottom, which is great. I was wondering, is there a ceiling on CDs as a percentage of
mix? I know you guys are stepping away from the promotion, but just wondering how much CDs you can make of
the deposit franchise?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Casey, we're getting a little bit of feedback, but I think you asked, is there a ceiling on CDs as to what we're
targeting in our portfolio? And I would say, I think we're still significantly underweighted in CDs versus our peers
and I look back at Q1 and where we grew in Q2. So, I think we still have a lot more room that we could grow CDs
if we aggressively were to price there. I would tell you, in the quarter, CDs were not our leading. We really
[Technical Difficulty] (00:20:06) a lot of money market funds was where we saw a lot of the [ph] new to client
(00:20:10) money come in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then, just following up, any updated thoughts on where cumulative deposit beta – apologies, if I
missed this, where cumulative deposit beta settles?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
In Investor Day, we said that we thought our cumulative deposit betas would be around 55%. I think that's still a
good range. I think we'll look at a – depending on what the rate environment is [Technical Difficulty] (00:20:36)
things that I mentioned in my comments, I do believe that we accelerated our deposit betas this quarter as a
result of our deposit gathering campaign. And so, future rate hikes do not require us to reprice our book the way
we would have had to in the past. I think we just accelerated that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We gave this [Technical Difficulty] (00:20:56) at Investor Day and I think we're still in that range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Excellent. And just lastly, on the expense front, up 5% year-over-year, tracking a little bit below your 6% to
8% guide for the year. Just wondering if that's conservative or is there going to be more expense pressure –
heavier expense pressure in the back half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I think that's realistic. I think one of the big things we need to add back is, we have $22 million of retention coming
back into operating that was previously charged to the merger center, which is a big part of it. And we also have
some hiring that we need to do, coming out of just being a little bit low, thinking that we were going to close on a
merger shortly and [ph] there are (00:21:40) some hiring that we need to do back, significant portions, but just
some pockets that we need to backfill.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on this quarter's loan
growth. I think if I'm doing the math right. The guide was reiterated, but this quarter was obviously much stronger
than I think many of us were anticipating. Does that imply kind of a shrinkage in the back half of the year? Or is
the guidance conservative? Just trying to kind of square the guidance. And then, maybe if you could touch on the
warehouse, looks like one of your larger competitors got out of the space. Just want to see what the potential
benefit to you all would be? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Michael, this is Bryan. I'll start. We think that loan growth will probably flatten out some in the back half of
the year. You had some continued pull-through of pipelines in the residential mortgage. You mentioned mortgage
warehouse lending. There has been some changes in the competitive landscape there and we've seen some
opportunities both on the pricing and the line utilization side to pick up some very nice relationships there.
And broadly speaking, we saw utilization in commercial real estate as we saw fund-up of some existing projects
that were done many, many quarters ago. So, we think that will start to level out. We think clearly the positive
trends we saw in deposits and deposit gathering, positioned us well to support our customer needs and to grow
the franchise attractively. And we'll take advantage of those opportunities. But our expectation for loan growth
over the full year is, it flattens out some in the back half of this year.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And then, maybe just switching to the fixed income business. I think this is the lowest quarter of revenue
that I have, at least in my model going back many, many years. Can you just give us an update on kind of the
competitive positioning of that business? And is this kind of a inflection point quarter? Are we going to get to some
sort of inflection point as the Fed hits terminal rates here in the next couple of months? Just want to get some
updates there. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Look, it's been a series of very tough quarters in that business. And average daily revenue has suffered as
a result. We're still very confident in our ability to serve our customers in a very unique way, where we're very
uniquely positioned with a broad customer base, a huge distribution model. And we're very confident that when
we do reach terminal rates and we start to see some transition and steepening of the yield curve, we're likely to
see that business recover nicely. We've always described it as somewhat countercyclical and we expect it will
continue to do that.
In the meantime, our teams are working very, very hard to deliver value through other channels, portfolio
advisory, asset management, research, things of that nature. And we're going to control cost and we'll be
positioned for the turn when it comes.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
The initial deposit promotion is over. I think you said, it wrapped up June the 30th. And then you mentioned there
was a new deposit promo going on, but at lower rates. What is the new kind of pricing of deposits for this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Since money market kind of been the one that we've had the most success with, I'll do that one. We were at
5.25% for money markets and starting July 1, we're now at 4.25%. So, we've decreased 100 basis points there.
And I would say that that's pretty directionally similar for our other products as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And the loan-to-deposit ratio ticked down a little bit in the second quarter. It's now at kind of a mid-90%
range. Is there a goal that you would like to see that ratio at – or are you actively trying to get that ratio lower?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, we don't have a goal around that. We're mindful that we have to fund our loans with deposits and our
securities portfolio. We think it's useful to look at both loans and securities portfolios, because they both have to
be funded in a similar fashion. We are mindful that we don't want that ratio to get too high. We're not
uncomfortable with where it is and our outlook and our ability to gather deposits doesn't give us any concern that
we're going to be overly constrained by our loan-to-deposit ratio. We're not going to let it get wildly out of ground.
But right now, we're very comfortable with how it's positioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then finally for me, just an update on the share buyback. If you look at your Common Equity Tier 1,
[indiscernible] (00:27:53) finish the year around 11.5%. That's a lot higher than your goal of 10% to 10.5%. Is
there any update on the willingness to consider a share buyback, especially with the stock at [ph] 1/10 (00:28:07)
of tangible?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I don't have any new information. We still have authorization in the buyback stock. We believe that right
now capital provides a really nice degree of optionality. We think it's important to see how this economic
environment plays out and we like being positioned with a strong capital base. We have plenty of opportunity to
deploy it and capital repatriation, whether it's dividend and/or buyback. But in the meantime, we're going to use it
to support our customers and look at opportunities to grow the balance sheet where appropriate.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brody Preston from UBS. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just wanted to ask, it seems like the interest bearing deposit growth was a little bit back half weighted when
comparing the period end and the average. And so, I just wanted to maybe ask on the spot rate of the interest
bearing deposit cost, do you happen to have what that is at quarter end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. No doubt it was back half weighted. With the termination in early May, we started the program in the back
half of May. Our spot rate at the end of the quarter would run in about 3.10%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
All-in cost of deposit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, Hope, just within the net interest income guide, I guess how much of the – I think you
were just a little bit below the low end of the 2Q guide. But you maintained and I know you changed the forward
curve outlook that you were using as it evolved. So, I just wanted to kind of ask how much did the removal of the
– I think you had a couple cuts, a handful of cuts in the back half of the year kind of baked into the previous
guidance, how much did the removal of those cuts add to the net interest income guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We did miss our guidance just slightly and that's all on deposit growth. We set up an Investor Day on June
6 and everyone thought we were going to have deposit runoff and we said, no, we're seeing deposit momentum.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
We didn't expect June to be a better month than May at that point. And we were really, really excited to see how
strong June came in, which did give us higher beta and a little lower net interest margin. But I will mention, the
rate we're paying for deposits is paying off wholesale funding. So, it is positive to our overall net interest margin
over the horizon as we pay down wholesale funding, as it matures and continue to use client deposits as our
primary way to fund our balance sheet.
When we look at the way the rate curve has moved, bringing a rate increase earlier in the year versus two
decreases later in the year is very positive to our margin since we're asset sensitive. But it does help to offset the
increased deposit rates we have. So, I believe we're still in range with all three of those offsetting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then, I wanted to ask one just on the fixed rate loan portfolio. Do you happen to know what the dollar
amount of fixed rate loans is that's repricing over the next 12 months? And do you know what the current yield on
those loans that our repricing is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brody, I don't know the yield on those – I can try to get them and have investor relations get back to you at the
end of the day. I don't have that, but it is about $5 billion that we have repricing in the next 12 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And what are current origination yields? I'm sorry, if you mentioned that and I missed it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We've seen our spread significantly widen out to about 150 to 30 spreads – 300 – 150 to 300 is what we're seeing
new originations at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then last one for me. Just within the AFS portfolio, do you happen to know what the effective
duration is of that portfolio? And then, I guess, within that duration calculation, do you know what conditional
prepayment rate you guys are using to come up with that duration?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Our effective duration is [ph] 5.2 (00:32:45) and then we assume a [ph] 5 (00:32:47) prepayment rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I appreciate it.

Operator: Our next question is from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Just a couple of questions here. The excess
liquidity that was generated in the second quarter, looks like it's sitting in cash right now. Just curious what the
use of that liquidity is going to be? Are you going to pay down some borrowings with that? Is that going to go into
the bond books, any color we can get on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We plan to pay down our borrowings on that. We had laddered out our borrowings and the deposits came in a
little bit quicker. So, it wasn't intentional to have that much cash at the Fed. But as FHLB matures, our debt, we
will pay it off with that excess funds.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then the – it sounds like you're going to continue building liquidity throughout the rest of the year. Is
that going to be the strategy there as well, or could we see some additional layering into the bond book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
At this time, we have no intention of putting any additional securities on the books. Our intention is to improve our
liquidity position. As you said, and as Bryan said earlier, use our strong capital position and liquidity, we generate
to be there for our clients and customers during this time and support our loan growth that we still – we have
moderating loan growth in the back half of the year, but still loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
In fact, our expectation is at the securities portfolio because we're making very limited reinvestment. They'll
continue to trend down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe from a bigger picture standpoint, the deposit growth that you
generated in the second quarter, can you just talk about kind of the geographic diversity there and how that plays
into the broader strategy as a standalone company once again, as kind of the near-term strategy to further
penetrate [ph] IBERIABANK (00:34:53) markets kind of with a more broad product offering? Is it on working to
gain market share in Tennessee, namely Nashville, kind of all of the above? Maybe just give a sense on how
you're thinking about geographic strategy here?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Yeah. The breakdown, if I recall the numbers, it was about 20% of the deposit growth was in the state of
Tennessee and 80% was out. And so, it's fairly broad-based and diverse. We think that as we look at the next
several quarters, we're realizing the benefits of the promise of the IBERIABANK, First Horizon merger vehicles.
We think we have a great opportunity to continue to grow our presence in these very attractive higher growth
markets that we're in all across the south.
And one of the areas of emphasis for us will be – in the coming quarters will be, how we continue to build out that
retail presence and retail focus and what would been the legacy IBERIABANK markets. So, we see there being a
huge opportunity for us to capitalize on a unique business model and value proposition for our customers, at the
same time drive attractive deposit growth and the ability to serve our customers more broadly in these higher
growth markets.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're
ready.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. My first question, at Investor Day last month, you indicated that
you were able to retain nearly 90% of associates through the first quarter of this year while waiting for the TD deal
to move forward. What did banker retention look like in the second quarter and since Investor Day? And are there
any notable changes from the retention statistics you provided at Investor Day?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No. No notable changes. Our banker and client retention have continued to be very, very good. And we're
encouraged with the excitement, enthusiasm we see in both groups, our associates, our bankers, as well as our
clients. So, our retention has been good. And I haven't seen the final numbers, but my best estimate would be
that it's probably improved from what you saw in the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, on the deposit gathering promotion, I guess, from a high level, why did you feel like you needed
to be aggressive with engaging in deposit gathering promotions, not just from existing clients, but also from new
to bank clients?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2023
Well, couple of thoughts. Clearly, we had maybe one of the more unique situations in mid-April with the
termination – excuse me, mid-May with the termination of the merger. And we wanted to do a couple of things.
One, that was a period where there was an awful lot in play and we all know that the deposit base in the US has
been volatile and contracting. So, one, we wanted to be very well-positioned to not only to protect the home field,
but to be aggressive and front footed in terms of demonstrating our commitment to the markets that we serve.
It was a great opportunity to get our bankers on the phone, talking to customers, having a positive conversation
about First Horizon, how we're positioned, what we're looking to do over the foreseeable future, and how we
continue to be committed to serving them and their needs.
And then thirdly, Hope mentioned wholesale funds and sort of the alternative wholesale funds. Even at the same
cost, you certainly get a relationship benefit when you deal with a client versus a Federal home loan bank
borrowing. So, we looked at it, said it was a appropriate period to say we're going to reset, we're going to draw a
line. Under the termination of the merger, we're going to get very front footed, we're going to demonstrate our
commitments to customers, our marketplace, and our commitment to delivering on the value of the First Horizon
model.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And my last question, of the $5.8 billion deposits you added in the second quarter from the campaign, how
much would you say is sticky? And how does this break down into the $3.5 billion from new clients and the $2.3
billion deposits from existing clients? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
New to bank clients, we saw 80% of that in consumer and 20% of that in commercial. And on the deepening
relationships, it was 51% consumer, 49% commercial. We see every one of these as an opportunity to introduce
new clients to the First Horizon franchise. And so, now that we have a deposit relationship with them, we're calling
on them and trying to deepen relationships in other spaces. So, we are hoping that the majority of these will be
sticky. We're not seeing them as transitional deposits. We're reaching out to these clients and trying to build
relationships with every single one of them. We have 4% more clients this quarter than we had before and we see
that as an opportunity to continue to grow relationships with them and create more profitability.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, the real opportunity in our view, which is, we recognize that you attract customers and – new
customers in any deposit campaign, principally with rate, but it is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment
to service and deepening. And if you look at the deposit growth we had with our existing customer base, roughly
$2.3 billion, $2.4 billion, my recollection is right, something like 60% of that was with our primary customer base,
58%, something like that. So, what we want to do is, take the opportunity. We have a locked in period here and
we'll take the opportunity to deepen the relationship, broaden the relationship with these customers. The new
customers, the 32,000, if I remember the numbers right, it was about 23,000, 24,000 were retail and about 6,000-
plus were – 6,500 were commercial. So, that's a great opportunity for us to broaden relationship. And we have
said about doing that and I expect we'll have very good results with it.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. I'm good. Thanks. I had a credit question for you or for Susan. Just about the migration of just downgrades
on whether special mention or substandard, however you look at it and how you think that may play out in the
quarters ahead?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Thanks, Chris. We had a little bit of additional downgrades into [indiscernible] (00:42:55) but it was very
moderate. And it's something that we typically do see. As you know, in second quarter, we're getting year-end
financials in compliance. We're still very, very pleased with the overall asset quality for the portfolio. So, in terms
of total classified [indiscernible] (00:43:20) 1.7% at the end of the quarter and non-accruals at 0.7%. As Hope
pointed out, we actually had a decrease in our non-accrual loan balances.
So, obviously, we're watching it carefully with what's going on in the economy, rising interest rates. But as we
talked to our bankers and clients, we feel like that in many cases borrowers are getting used to this environment.

They're adjusting businesses or being able to pass along increases in prices. So, again, we believe we're well-
positioned, but we're watching it carefully and doing the appropriate servicing and monitoring that we need to do
and continue to be diligent in initial underwriting as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
It's kind of interesting when you talk to our bankers and the customers, Chris. This expected recession that's
always six months off and just continues to roll, it still feels like customers, borrowers are in a pretty good place.
As Susan said, they've adjusted very well to higher rates and the changing dynamics around inflation. And as she
said, paying an awful lot of attention to grading and understanding how our borrowers are doing, but at the end of
the day, things still feel relatively good at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you for that. And, Susan, would there be any possible reserve release as the unfunded
commitments come down, is that a possibility?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Firstly, obviously, we have to re-evaluate it every quarter, Chris, in terms of looking at what growth we've had and
balances in unfunded, things like what's going on in the economy. At this point, I feel like the reserve is where it
needs to be, based on what we know today and we'll gauge that obviously if there are opportunities to release.
We take a look at that just like we look at changing economic conditions when – either there's growth or there's
deterioration in the economy.
