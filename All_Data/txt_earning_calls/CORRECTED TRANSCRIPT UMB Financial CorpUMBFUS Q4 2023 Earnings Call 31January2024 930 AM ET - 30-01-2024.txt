Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Thank you, Kay, and good morning. Before I get started, I've got to talk about some very important business, like
congratulating our hometown heroes, the Kansas City Chiefs, who are yet again headed to the Super Bowl in a
couple of weeks.
Now, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance for 2023, a year that played out very
differently from what we were expecting, and I think the rest of you were expecting last year. During a particularly
challenging period for the banking industry, UMB delivered strong results, demonstrating the power and resilience
of our diversified business model. We closed out the year with a solid fourth quarter. I'll review a few highlights,
and then Ram will add more detail in the financial drivers' section.
As you know, most banks recognize the expense for the FDIC special assessment in the fourth quarter. Our
share of the assessment was $52.8 million, an impact of about $1.08 per share pre-tax to net income. We
presented our financial metrics both on a GAAP basis and adjusted to exclude this charge.
For the full year of 2023, net income was $350 million or $7.18 a share. On an adjusted basis, net operating
income was $397.1 million or $8.14 per share. For the fourth quarter, we earned $70.9 million or $1.45 a share.
However, as adjusted, net operating income was $112 million or $2.29 per share, representing an increase of
13.9% compared to the third quarter of 2023 and 10.8% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Our results
reflected strong loan growth and deposit growth, expanding net interest margin and net interest income, solid fee
income growth and exceptional asset quality.
Average loan balances increased 6.3% on an annualized basis from the third quarter to $23.1 billion. For
comparison, banks between $10 billion and $100 billion in assets that have reported results so far have shown an
annualized increase of 2.6%. We posted strong top line production, 40% above third quarter and in line with our
levels in recent quarters. Construction and commercial real estate drove most of our loan growth in the fourth
quarter with continued draws on previously approved construction loans.
Payoff levels increased to 4.4% of loans, impacting C&I balances. CRE growth has been largely in multi-family
and industrial projects. Once again, we've included more detail on the portfolio in our slides, showing the mix of
loans by type and geography along with LTVs and other metrics. Asset quality in the book remains strong. We
adhere to conservative standards, which includes underwriting to imputed or stressed interest rates and moderate
loan-to-value ratios. We don't use trended rents and we have very strong liquid sponsors with great cash flow.
90% of our investment CRE portfolio is recoursed.
Speaking of asset quality, we reported excellent metrics with improvements across the board. Nonperforming loan
levels improved again to 6 basis points, while delinquency levels declined, and we saw an 11% decrease in
classified loans. Net charge-offs were 2 basis points of average loans for the quarter and just 5 basis points for
the full year of 2023. Again, we outperformed peer banks which have reported a median net charge-off rate for
the fourth quarter of 15 basis points so far.
On slide 26, we included a longer term history of charge-offs, which have averaged just 28 basis points over the
last 20 years. In 2023, we experienced a 16 basis point reduction in our annual charge-off rate compared to 2022,
reflecting the active management of our portfolio. I'm pleased with this result, especially given the environment
and cautious narrative we're hearing across the industry. Again, we compare favorably to peer banks, which have
reported a median 6 basis point increase in net charge-off levels year-over-year.
Moving to deposits. Average balances increased 17.2% on an annualized basis from the third quarter. This
growth was led by commercial customers, including a 11% annualized increase in commercial DDA balances. We

are seeing traction from our effort to bring clients' total banking relationships to UMB. Peers so far have seen
average annualized deposit growth of just 2.5% thus far in the quarter. Net interest income increased 3.7% as
margin improved 3 basis points sequentially. From industry reports so far, our NIM expansion compares favorably
with peers reporting a median decline of 4 basis points. We continue to deploy cash flows from the securities
portfolio into loans, and the pace of increased funding costs has slowed each of the past two quarters. Ram will
share more detail and drivers on our margin outlook for 2024.
Noninterest income for the fourth quarter was $140.3 million, representing 38% of revenue, more than two times
the 17% median reported by peers. Our fee businesses continue to build scale and we're seeing momentum in
several areas. A few highlights include fund services where assets under administration have eclipsed $411
billion, a $48 billion improvement over 2022 levels. And in our custody business, we have had a 27% increase in
net new accounts this year.
Our fixed income and trading teams saw increased activity as the expectation that the Fed has finished raising
rates and has provided a little more clarity and brought some participants back into the market. We've shared
additional detail on our fee income businesses and the revenue that's provided by them in our slides. And Ram
will add more detail when he speaks.
Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 4.3% from a linked quarter basis. We posted positive operating
leverage of 1.3% on a linked quarter basis and 0.3% in the year-over-year quarter.
As seen on slide 31, our capital position improved during the fourth quarter, with a 17 basis point increase in both
CET 1 and total capital ratios, which stood at 10.94% and 12.85% respectively. Our earnings continue to support
our capital position in spite of the impact of the FDIC special assessment.
Finally, we saw increased profitability ratios with operating ROTCE of 16.62% versus 14.96% in the third quarter.
Tangible book value improved nearly 12% from September 30 to $58.12 per share. Peer banks so far have
reported a median tangible book value increase of 6.9% in the quarter. Overall, we had a very solid quarter,
especially given the challenging year we all had.
Before I turn it over to Ram, I'd like to share a few thoughts on the events of last spring that ultimately led to the
FDIC's special assessment we recognized in the fourth quarter. It has become very clear that the underlying
cause of the 2023 bank failures was interest rate mismatch, primarily on the asset side. A few banks were ill-
positioned and poorly managed for the interest rate environment we found ourselves in, with a largely fixed asset
base that lacked flexibility. One lesson learned during that time was the power of various market participants to
fuel a largely media-based crisis and circus.
As the panic spread across media outlets, the risk of a self-fulfilling prophecy became real. Our reputation with
our clients and in our markets is something we have earned and cherished over 110 years of history. It was
extremely frustrating for us to watch these industry observers pontificate based on a lack of understanding of how
the industry works and continue to focus on the wrong symptoms like unadjusted, uninsured deposits or AOCI.
This was a classic case of facts getting in the way of a good narrative.
As I've said before, thank you to you, the analysts and the investors on the call with us today who took the time
and care to understand the thematic of what transpired in the spring. Year-end reports have confirmed what we
already knew to be true. The fundamentals in this industry remain steady. The demise of regional banks didn't
happen, as predicted, and banks like ours that were well-prepared have not only weathered the storm, but
emerged stronger and with positive results. The resiliency of the banking industry has been evident and on

display in recent months, and the liquidity, regulatory capital levels, loan portfolio, asset quality and funding
sources remain strong.
In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our UMB associates that drove this performance, and I'm deeply grateful to our
loyal client base that grew with us through this much exaggerated industry noise in 2023. It was extremely
rewarding to see how our company and customers came together to support each other. As always, we run our
company with a strong focus on both the short-term and the long-term performance through every stage and
every economic cycle, and we feel good about our strategy.
Looking ahead into 2024, we see a muted, but resilient macro environment, and we remain well-positioned for
any environment with an attractive loan-to-deposit level, strong capital ratios and high quality loan portfolio.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ram to give you more details on our results. Ram?

Thanks, Mariner. Net interest income increased $8.2 million in the fourth quarter to $230.5 million, driven primarily
by loan growth and repricing along with higher levels of liquidity. Net interest margin was 2.46%, an increase of 3
basis points from the linked quarter. Loan repricing and mix provided a 9 basis point benefit. Other positives
included 3 basis points from the benefit of free funds and liquidity levels, including stable levels of DDA balances,
2 basis points from the securities portfolio and 1 basis point from changes in borrowing levels. These benefits
were partially offset by higher deposit costs. Cycle to date, our earning asset beta has been tracking along with
our total cost of funds' beta, both now at 53%.
Average deposits increased 17.2% annualized from the third quarter, benefiting from the ongoing deposit
gathering initiatives across all our lines of businesses. The typical seasonal increase in public fund balances
during the month of December added $157 million in average deposits for the quarter. These increases were
partially offset by the intentional reduction in brokered CD balances. Excluding those brokered deposits, average
deposits increased 22% annualized from the prior quarter.
Additionally, corporate trust deposits tend to be a little bit lumpy as clients build up cash and make payments
throughout the year. As the third largest municipal trustee in the US, balances will ebb and flow, driven by
municipal bond distributions and other activity. I'll note that on an end-of-period basis, corporate trust deposits
increased, pointing to the timing differences throughout the quarter in our escrow, specialty trust and paying agent
businesses.
Our deposit remix continued at a slower pace this quarter. DDA balances increased 1% from the third quarter and
now represent 31% of total average deposits, providing the benefit to margin I noted. Cycle-to-date betas on total
deposits and on loan yields are 48% and 59% respectively. This is on track with our previously discussed
expectations for terminal betas of approximately 50% for deposits and 60% for loans.
Looking ahead into the first quarter, we expect our loan yields will continue to benefit from the flexibility we've built
into our balance sheet through repricing as loans come up for renewal and from higher yields on new origination.
Overall, we expect our loan yields to meet or exceed the increases in cost of funds.
Additionally, we have approximately $1.6 billion in cash flows from our securities portfolio, rolling off at 2.2% that
will be reinvested in higher yielding loans or securities. In the fourth quarter, we began legging back in with some
modest repurchases of mortgage-backed and Treasury securities. We will continue to assess based on collateral

needs, loan growth and overall market conditions. As liquidity and public fund balances seasonally dissipate and
given one less day in the first quarter, we expect net interest income and margin to compress modestly from
fourth quarter levels. Actual performance will be driven by material shifts in funding mix, especially DDA balances
and the shape of the curve.
Details and activities in our securities portfolio are shown on slides 27 and 28. The combined AFS and held to
maturity portfolios averaged $12.1 billion during the quarter, a decline of 1.5% from the third quarter. The average
roll-off yield was 2.38% for the quarter. The new purchases of $154 million shown on the table excluded $500
million of short-term T-Bills purchased at 5.39% as additional collateral for public funds deposit. Excluding those
Treasuries, we expect $1.6 billion of securities with a yield of 2.23% to roll off over the next 12 months. The
unrealized loss position in our combined securities book improved this quarter to $1.1 billion, representing
approximately 8.5% of the total portfolio, down from 14% in the third quarter.
Back to the income statement. Our provision expense of zero this quarter was the result of the impact of payoffs
on net loan growth, the quality of our portfolio, including the low level of net charge-offs and macroeconomic
variables that seem to expect a softer landing. As we look into the first quarter, we expect provision to be
impacted by a small acquisition of a cobrand credit card portfolio expected to close in March, which will add
approximately $125 million in balances with a day one provision of roughly $6 million and ongoing provision
based on portfolio performance, growth and macroeconomic variables.
This acquisition will also add approximately $10 million in net interest income, $2 million in interchange fees and a
breakeven pre-tax pre-provision in the first year excluding conversion and integration costs.
On the fee income side, reported results included some market-related variances, including increases of $3.7
million in company-owned life insurance income and $567,000 in customer-related derivative income. Trading and
investment banking income increased $2 million, primarily related to municipal trading volume. The detailed
drivers of noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release and on a GAAP basis included the
recognition of the $52.8 million FDIC special assessment.
On an operating basis, expenses increased $6.9 million or 3% from the third quarter to $235.9 million. Detailed
variances are included on slide 22, but the largest impacts were $3.1 million in deferred compensation expense,
an increase of $2.7 million from the prior quarter. This is the offset to the increased COLI income, $2.3 million
related to the pre-buy of computers in the fourth quarter and $1.5 million in additional charitable contributions.
Partial offsets included a $1.6 million decrease in payroll taxes, insurance and 401(k) expense, and a $467,000
reduction in bonus and commissions expense.
Excluding the one-time items and timing-related variances, our core expense run rate in the fourth quarter was
approximately $230 million. Please note that in addition to the impact of the cobrand card portfolio acquisition, first
quarter salary and benefits expense will increase with the impact of the extra leap year day and for the typical
seasonal reset of FICA and payroll taxes.
Our effective tax rate was 17% for the full year 2023 compared to 18.9% in 2022. The decreased rate was driven
primarily by a larger portion of income from tax-exempt securities and variations in levels of COLI income. For
2024, we would expect a similar tax rate ranging from 17% to 19%.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

Hey, good morning, Nick.

Hey, there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Moutafakis Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Maybe just to start out on the margin. Given the potential for rate cuts coming later in this year in 2024, could
we see the margin continue to expand into 2024 with more back book repricing and the continued mix shift?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure, Nick. This is Ram. And we don't give any forward guidance other than what I said in my prepared
comments about there might be some modest compression in the first quarter because of the excess liquidity that
we saw in the fourth quarter going away. But as we said in the past calls, right, the higher for longer scenario is a
good scenario for us because, as you've seen in the last couple of quarters, the pressure on deposit costs have
largely abated for us, and then our loan yields are still repricing higher. So loan yields will at least do better than
cost of funds for us. And then there's $1.6 billion of securities that are rolling off at 2.2% that we can invest in the
current rate environment.
So, I think we're close to the trough on margin. Any particular quarter, it might have been slow a little bit of a few
basis points here and there, but feel good about our margin trajectory until the Fed starts cutting at some point in
2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

hangs in the balance.

Great. Thank you. And maybe it also depends on the revenue outlook, I guess, a little bit. But could we see
positive operating leverage in 2024 depending on the expense growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, I think that – we remain focused on operating leverage. And again, based on the guidance question, we
don't really give guidance. What I would say is that the environment that we come into 2024 with from 2023
remains from a standpoint of elevated interest expense and the interest rate environment. And because of that,
demonstrating absolute strength on the operating leverage remains challenging. We'll continue to do everything
we can and work against it. We believe on a relative basis that we'll outperform on operating leverage.

Nathan J. Race Q

Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning and congrats...

Hey, good morning, Nathan.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...on the win. Just a question on the NII sensitivity. I appreciate the disclosure in the deck around 100 basis point
decline in rates is about a 3.1% impact to NII in year two. Just curious how – to what extent you think that it can
be offset by just the volume of kind of continued margin accretive growth in both loans and deposits going forward
and also with the cash flow you have coming off the securities portfolio as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, you hit the nail on the head there, Nate. That is a static analysis, as you know, right? So it's all based on
just cash flows coming in and being reinvested in new environment. And so the net interest income projected in
that baseline scenario of minus 100 in year two does not include the impact of any growth and any actions we
might take, right? You've seen us, and you'll see in our disclosures that we put on some swap synthetic hedges
as well. So we'll do additional – we'll evaluate it on a periodic basis and put on additional hedges to protect
ourselves from a down rate environment. But that's just a statistical modeling of what would happen to our
8

balance sheet if all things were kept the same on a static balance sheet basis. So we can take steps to mitigate it,
and so that's another layer that we'll add on to it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And as you think about looking forward into 2024, we typically give you a 90-day look forward. Loan growth in the
first quarter looks stronger than it did in the fourth quarter. So signs continue to be good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then just within that context around kind of the NII trajectory in deposit costs. I think you guys
have about $2.5 billion in wholesale funding maturing in the first half of this year. How are you guys thinking about
replacing the cash flow off the securities [ph] book (00:24:33)? Is it going to be one lever and then any other kind
of thoughts on just how we should think about those wholesale sources in the first half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, on page 31, Nate – yeah, on page 31, on the bottom right, we have all the wholesale funding. Obviously, as
you can see, we have about $1.6 billion of brokered CDs. Given our deposit pipeline, which remains strong, we
might not need all of it, right, so, but there's a potential the way what market rates are at that point, and we may
leg in for half of it or something less than that. The other one that's maturing – that will mature in the second
quarter is $1 billion of FLHB advances, and then we have BTFP, which will extend into January. Again, we'll
evaluate it based on collateral needs. We'll base it on where market rates are. We'll look for spread and all those
things, but we don't need any of those tools really, given our liquidity position and our loan to deposit, but we'll
take it as the environment evolves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, and I think that Ram's comment about the brokered CDs is we may – we don't need them, but we may roll
back into some of them just because by the time they come due, rates will likely have come down and we can
have positive arbitrage on them. So might make sense to roll back into some of them just from a profitability
standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Maybe just turning to credit, curious to hear perhaps from Tom in terms of what
occurred in the quarter in terms of criticized, classified trends. And obviously, charge-offs have been very low over
the last few quarters. And I think in the past, we've talked about a normalized charge-off range in the 20 basis
point to 30 basis point range. So just curious, just given where NPA stands and based on the commentary around
criticized trends, if you think we're going to get back to that historical range at some point this year or into 2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Nate, that's my favorite question because it's the thing that we're really most proud of. And I think that when you
think – I think about this investor community and looking at your alternatives and the investment thesis, looking
into banks that the thing that you look at with us is I'm sitting at the table right here with two other guys that have
9

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
been making credit decisions with me for 20 years through all of the cycles that we've looked at, and we've
outperformed the peer group in all of those cycles.
And when we talk about 27 basis points, 28 basis points, we're just using math history. If you look at page 26, you
just – you're just looking at our history. And one thing I would note about that in our investment deck is while,
yeah, the average over 20 years is higher than the 2 basis points we have in the fourth quarter, you have to
recognize, that comes with a lot of growth. So if you go back 20 years ago, the first year I was CEO, we had $2.7
billion in loans with 20 basis points of charge-off. Today, we have $23 billion in loans with 2 basis points of
charge-off.
So in the context of much greater opportunity for loss, we've maintained a very, very low charge-off rate, and
that's because of consistency and continuity of approach. And we make this easy for you guys because you can
look at the history. Most of the banks you look at have different teams and turnover and change and strategy
change and acquisitions or whatever it is. You're staring at the same company with the same team, same results.
And what I would say about the 28 basis points, when you think about this year and where – wherever we end up,
we will outperform. And what I – if you look at the charge-off history over the last 20 years, us against the peer,
we had a chart – the second – the page before that shows that it's in a different – it's in a – you – we have a chart
that shows us against a peer group, and if you – the point is, if you look at a recessionary period, our line – our
doubtful line stays very close to the bottom axis of a chart, while there's a shark fin that takes place with the
industry.
So that's what happened in the last crisis. We expect that to happen. If you look at it through the fourth quarter,
it's – you can see it's already taking place. Our numbers don't move and the peer groups and the industry is
starting to move up. We expect that to be the case again. Whatever the absolute numbers are, I can't tell you. But
the relationship to the peer group and the industry, we expect to remain the same.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. Very helpful. And just one last one. It seems like a lot of the growth in the quarter came on the
commercial real estate side of things. So just curious, in terms of the composition of the pipeline entering 2024
and kind of where you guys are seeing pretty pronounced opportunities to grow loans today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Loan growth, we've been saying this for a really long time, we call it the – we have a long runway for growth, both
geographically, vertically across our footprint, international footprint related to our ABL business, largely because
of market share gains. We expect that to remain the same.
The caveat to that would be if we do have a softening economy, the rate at which we would grow on an absolute
basis may come down from what our expectations are of ourselves. But on a relative basis, we would expect
ourselves to continue to outperform on loan growth for the same reasons we always have. For 20 years, we've
done that. And we expect that to continue again for the same – very same reasons, which would be more market
share-driven than they are economic conditions-driven. So nothing new there. The absolute number could come
down a bit from what we did last year based on what the economic conditions are. But again, you're buying on a
relative basis and we expect ourselves to outperform on a relative basis, again.

Market specific, it's still coming from the major metros. Utah has been a nice growth market for us where we have

Okay. Understood. Very helpful. And if I could just ask one last one, do you guys see any change in credit ratings
across, I think, around 4% of loans that are tied to office CRE?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Thomas S. Terry A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, we've had very little, if any, deterioration in our office portfolio, which remains strong, with 4.5% of the
portfolio, as you said. A couple of statistics. 45% of our office portfolio is single tenant, which adds a layer of
strength there in terms of rollover; strong sponsors, which we've talked about in the past. We have seen basically
no deterioration in that portfolio and don't really see anything coming on the horizon. They're performing. A lot of
the leases – the underlying leases on these office projects go out to 2027 and beyond. Roughly 70% of those
leases are 2027 and beyond. So in terms of rollover in the short term, very manageable.

Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, thanks, everybody. Looks like that's the last question. Just want to reiterate something. We're really proud
of the year we had in the quarter. And I think at the end of the day, we do what we say, and we say what we do,
and we've been doing it for a long time. And we've demonstrated strong, outsized loan growth, deposit growth,
fees, expense control year in and year out. And I think the good news for the investor population, as they think
about us, is you should know what to expect from us.
And we did it again in the fourth quarter and we're more thrilled than ever about the fourth quarter because we
were able to sort of put to bed a lot of the nonsense in the narrative. As I like to say, don't let facts get in the way
of a real exciting narrative that the pundits like to deliver last year.
And so on behalf of everybody on the call, we're happy to have delivered what we did in the fourth quarter to kind
of put some of that nonsense to bed. And so we'll just keep doing it for you. And we're really proud and excited
about what we delivered, and we're just going to keep doing it for you. So thanks.
