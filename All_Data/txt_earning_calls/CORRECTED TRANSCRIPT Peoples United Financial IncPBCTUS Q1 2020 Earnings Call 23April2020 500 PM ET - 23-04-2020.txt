It's David. It seems like we don't have Jack...

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
David, sorry. Thank you, Andrew and David. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today and hope
that you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. These are uncertain times for everyone but we are
all in this together. I believe we can collectively emerge from this pandemic more united and stronger than ever.
With that, let's begin by turning to slide 2. While the economic impact of COVID-19 will have a meaningful effect
on the results for the remainder of 2020, our first quarter performance marked a strong start to the year and we
entered the crisis in a position of strength. As a community-oriented bank, we have a responsibility to protect
colleagues, support customers and fair for communities especially in the current environment.
I would like to take a moment to say thank you to our employees. Their dedication, professionalism and resilience
during this unprecedented period has been remarkable. Despite challenging conditions, they have continued to
provide the level of support and service customers have come to expect from People's United. I am particularly
proud of the terrific effort displayed by the employees in the completion of the core system conversion and full
integration of United Bank in early April.
The health and safety of our employees is always a top priority for the company. As the seriousness of the
pandemic became clear, we immediately implemented a company-wide prevention and social distancing policy
that included a remote-enabled workforce. We also adjusted branch service including reduced hours and
appointment-only banking to limit the potential spread of the virus. Frontline employees and those in positions
where telecommuting is not possible were given additional paid time-off for further flexibility to care for families
and stay home if feeling sick themselves.
For additional support, we enhanced benefits for all employees covered under our health plans so the cost of
COVID-19-related illness including diagnosis, testing and any further related treatments are covered. People's
United is committed to assisting those individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19. Consistent with our
long history of providing support in times of need, we instituted relief initiatives designed to mitigate hardships to
customers caused by the pandemic. Such relief measures include waiving of certain fees, implementing a 90-day
foreclosure moratorium on eligible residential loans, and offering individualized support to both consumer and
business loans.
People's United is a relationship-based bank and as such, we believe it is critical to work with our customers to
help them manage through difficult financial times. We did this during the financial crisis over a decade ago and
many of those customers have grown, prospered, and remained with us today. As the result of hardships caused
by the pandemic, we have offered forbearance for both commercial and retail customers to once again help them
navigate the challenging economic landscape. As of April 20, we have approved forbearance for approximately
7,200 loans totaling $2.9 billion, comprised of $1.8 billion in commercial, $387 million in equipment finance, and
$657 million in retail.
People's United is also participating in the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program. We accepted nearly 11,000
applications of which more than 9,600 loans totaling greater than $2.1 billion have been submitted to the SBA and
3

approved. We have currently funded $1 billion of these loans, and the feedback received from businesses we've
worked with has been overwhelmingly positive.
Finally, we are also engaging community organizations and government officials to ensure a coordinated
approach to COVID-19 relief efforts. Through the bank and its charitable foundations we have granted more than
$3.5 million in support. This includes providing monetary support to response funds and non-profits that are
meeting the basic needs of vulnerable populations, including low-income residents, first responders, healthcare
workers, and small businesses.
Moving to slide 3, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. The results benefited from both organic
growth and recent acquisitions, and reflected a stable margin, continued strong fee income, as well as solid loan
and deposit growth.
Other highlights include operating income of $141 million, increased 15% from the first quarter last year and
generated an operating return on average tangible common equity of 13.2%. Total revenue of $520 million was
up 22% from the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax pre-provision net revenue of $218 million increased 32% from a year
ago on an operating basis. The efficiency ratio of 54% improved 330 basis points year-over-year as we continued
to produce positive operating leverage. The provision of $33.5 million increased $26.4 million or 371% compared
to our 2019 quarterly run rate, reflecting the application of CECL and the impact of COVID-19.
And finally, tangible book value per common share increased 7% from a year ago, even after closing two
acquisitions and repurchasing 20 million common shares. People's United has always had a long-term view
predicated on conservative underwriting philosophy, superior service, a diversified business mix, and prudent
liquidity and capital management which has served us well through various operating environments.
Sustained exceptional asset quality is a hallmark of our institution, and we firmly believe it is an important lever in
building long-term value. As we have grown the company from $14 billion in total assets at the end of 2007 to
over $60 billion today, we have never wavered from our conservative and well-defined underwriting approach.
The experience of our senior credit officers is significant with an average tenure of over 25 years. This same team
successfully steered People's United through the prior financial crisis with a low level of losses.
As you can see on slide 4, our average charge-off, as a percentage of average loans from 2008 through last year,
is only 16 basis points, well below the peer median of 53 basis points. Another driver of our exceptional asset
quality is our high-quality, cycle-tested customer base. Our local market expertise enables us to identify and
develop long-term relationships with highly coveted, strong business owners and operators. Many of our
customers were with us during the prior financial crisis, as evidenced by the average tenure of our top 25
relationships being over 17 years. These long-term relationships provide us with deep knowledge of their
businesses and operating performance through economic cycles.
The diversification of our loan portfolio is displayed on slide 5. It is always important, however, during economic
downturns the value of this diversification becomes even more prominent. One of the strategic objectives of our
risk management is running a diversified business model that does not overly expose the bank to a single line of
business.
We have provided our exposure to sectors significantly impacted by COVID-19 on slide 6, and our conservative
approach to underwriting is evident. Our hospitality portfolio had $1 billion in balances at the end of the quarter.
The majority of the portfolio is flagged by major hotel brands, and most of the properties are managed and owned
4

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
by operators in this space as their primary business. In addition, the properties are primarily located in the main
cities within our footprint, such as Boston, Portsmouth and Burlington.
In addition, our top 10 clients account for over 70% of our commercial real estate hotel exposure. Each of these
sponsors are cycle-tested and have extensive hotel experience. In our $540 million restaurant portfolio, nearly
half of the exposure is concentrated in quick service establishments, which have experienced lesser degree of
disruption. At the quarter-end, balances in our retail were $4.7 billion. We have no material exposure to enclosed
retail malls and over half of our retail exposure is with grocery store-anchored properties, pharmacies, big box
home improvement, and gas stations and convenience stores.
Finally, it's important to note that we have immaterial or no exposure to airlines, cruise lines, casinos, energy,
student loans, auto lending and consumer credit cards.
Before passing the call over to David to discuss CECL and the first quarter results in more detail, I want to
mention that due to the uncertain economic outlook caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn the full-year 2020
goals we outlined in January. As I commented earlier, People's United entered this crisis in a position of strength
with exceptional asset quality, strong liquidity and capital levels, and a diversified business mix. We are confident
in our strategy of operating with a long-term view. We'll once again show the strength of the franchise as it plays a
critical role in supporting the financial health for individuals, businesses and communities throughout this crisis
and beyond.
With that, here's David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jack. We started the year with another strong quarterly financial performance. As Jack just
referenced, we entered the crisis in a position of strength. Our diversified loan portfolio has high-quality, cycle-
tested borrowers, low LTVs and strong cash flows. We certainly did not underwrite our portfolios with an
assumption of a global pandemic. However, we are confident our conservative underwriting approach, significant
and cycle-tested risk management experience, and deep customer relationships will continue to serve us well as
we move through this unfolding situation.
With that background, looking at slide 7 and 8, we highlight the adoption of CECL and its application in the first
quarter. The day one impact of the adoption of CECL was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $72.2
million, or 29%, from year-end to $318.8 million. This increase was primarily driven by the higher reserve
requirements associated with the company's longer-duration retail portfolio, partially offset by shorter-duration
commercial portfolios and our low historical loss experience. The day two impact of the application of CECL
further increased the allowance by $22.9 million, or 9%, to $341.7 million, which effectively was off due to COVID-
19.
Our quantitative modeling reflects a baseline economic forecast as of late March, which is indicative of a U-
shaped recovery in the second half of 2020. The forecast is inclusive of COVID-19 and the government response
at that time. In addition, underlying the allowance is a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, as
well as a one-year straight line reversion to historical losses.
Our allowance at March 31 provides significant coverage as it represents more than 8 times our annualized first
quarter net charge-offs and a 142% of nonperforming loans. Furthermore, the ACL represents 65% coverage of
5

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
our December 31, 2019 severely adverse internal stress test, which was inclusive of the recently acquired United
portfolios.
It is important to note the current allowance reflects the view of the loan portfolio's credit quality at quarter-end. It
represents our best estimate of future losses at that time. However, since we finalized estimates, the economic
environment has continued to deteriorate and a high level of uncertainty remains as to the duration and ultimate
impact of the pandemic. As such, we might experience another elevated provision in the second quarter.
Moving to slide 9, net interest income of $396 million increased $13.3 million or 3% from the fourth quarter. Net
interest income benefited from lower deposit and borrowing costs of $6.9 million and $2.8 million respectively. In
addition, higher balances in both the securities and loan portfolios collectively added $5.8 million. Conversely, net
interest income was lowered by $2.2 million due to one less calendar day in the first quarter.
As displayed on slide 10, net interest margin of 3.12% was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. The loan
portfolio negatively impacted the margin by 8 basis points driven by the downward repricing of floating rate loans
and new business yields coming in lower than the total loan portfolio yield. During the quarter, loan spreads
widened but were more than offset by lower benchmark interest rates. In addition, one less calendar day in the
first quarter lowered the margin by 2 basis points. Largely offsetting these negative effects was our continued
discipline management of deposits and lower borrowing costs, which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis
points and 2 basis points, respectively.
Turning to loans on slide 11, average balances of $43.5 billion increased by $1.5 billion or 3% from the fourth
quarter, primarily driven by higher average balances in commercial real estate and residential mortgage of $922
million and $217 million, respectively. On a period-end basis, loans increased $688 million or 2%, driven by a $1
billion increase in C&I balances, which benefited from strong results in the mortgage warehouse and large
corporate businesses. While large corporate benefited from approximately $200 million in line draws, the overall
C&I line utilization rate was consistent with the fourth quarter at 50%.
The largest offset to the C&I increase was a $236 million decline in residential mortgages, as we continue to
remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher-yielding portfolios. Approximately 46% of the loan portfolio at
quarter-end was either one month LIBOR or prime-based, up from 44% at year-end and $3.2 billion of these
floating rate loans have floors. Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio which is
in runoff mode, ended the quarter at $692 million, down $45 million from year-end.
I'd like to provide an update on the United portfolios we have chosen to runoff. In January, we stated we would
runoff $1.346 billion. Since then and upon further evaluation, we decided to retain certain relationships associated
with $233 million of these loans. After runoff during the first quarter of $71 million, the balance of these portfolios
was $1.042 billion at March 31. We now expect runoff in these portfolios to be $200 million to $300 million for the
full year.
Moving on to slide 12, deposit growth for the quarter was primarily driven by solid results in both our municipal
and commercial businesses. Average deposits increased nearly $2 billion linked-quarter benefiting from $1.1
billion in higher interest-bearing checking and money market balances, as well as $483 million in higher non-
interest-bearing balances. On a period end basis, balances increased $1.2 billion from yearend to $44.7 billion.
We remain focused on managing pricing as evidenced by an 11 basis point reduction in deposit cost during the
quarter.

Our funding and liquidity profile remain strong with secured borrowing capacity of $8 billion comprised of $4.2
billion in Federal Home Loan Bank capacity and $3.8 billion in unpledged securities. We also continued to
experience strong deposit inflows in the second quarter. Since quarter-end through April 20, deposit balances
have increased a further $2.6 billion.
Looking at slide 13, non-interest income of $123.8 million marked another strong quarterly result, although down
$400,000 from a record level in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter included a $7.6 million non-
operating gain, net of expenses, from the sale of eight central Maine branches. As such, on an operating basis,
noninterest income increased $7.2 million or 6%. Noninterest income benefited from a $15.3 million increase and
a net gain on the sale of loans and $3.4 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of
commercial insurance renewals. The net loan sale gain was driven by a $16.9 million gain related to the sale of
$492 million of loans acquired in the United transaction and held for sale at year-end.
We also recorded another strong quarter of customer interest rate swap income which was up $300,000 from a
high level in the fourth quarter. These increases were partially offset by $1.2 million lower investment
management fees and an aggregate decline of $1.7 million in bank service charges and commercial lending fees.
In addition, other noninterest income was unfavorably impacted by a $3 million write-down of an MSR asset
previously acquired from United and by $2.4 million lower income from the mark-to-market of one equity security
position. As you will recall, other noninterest income in the fourth quarter benefited from a $3.3 million gain on the
sale leaseback of our office building in Burlington, Vermont.
On slide 14, noninterest expense of $320.1 million declined $5.6 million linked-quarter. The first quarter benefited
from $21.2 million in lower non-operating costs which totaled $17.9 million and were in the following categories;
$15.1 million in professional and outside services, $500,000 in occupancy and equipment, $400,000 in
compensation and benefits, and $1.9 million in other non-interest expense. Excluding non-operating costs, non-
interest expense of $302.2 million was up $15.6 million or 5%. This increase was primarily driven by a $9.6 million
increase in compensation and benefit expenses, resulting from seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs and
having United on the books for the full quarter versus two months in the fourth quarter. We also incurred
approximately $1 million of additional expenses in response to COVID-19. These costs primarily resulted from
more extensive cleaning of our facilities and other measures taken to protect our employees.
Turning to slide 15, the efficiency ratio of 54% increased 30 basis points from a strong fourth quarter result, but
improved 330 basis points from a year ago. The seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter
were the primary reason for the modest uptick in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.
As Jack discussed earlier, our asset quality continues to be exceptional across each of our portfolios, and we
entered the pandemic in a position of strength. As displayed on slide 16, non-performing assets as a percentage
of loans and REO was 59 basis points and continue to be below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-
offs to average loans of 10 basis points was up 4 basis points linked-quarter. The increase was driven by two
charge-offs in commercial real estate which were unrelated to COVID-19 and had specific reserves previously
established. One of the charge-offs was a nursing home that had been experiencing difficulties for an extended
period and was finally closed. The other was a retail strip center which lost a significant tenant. Both of these
occurrences were one-off events.
Briefly on slide 17, return on average assets of 89 basis points were 96 basis points on an operating basis, and
return on average tangible common equity of 11.8% were 13.2% on an operating basis, were lower compared to
both linked and prior-year quarters. The decline in these returns was primarily driven by the provision increase
resulting from the adoption of CECL.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Finally, on slide 18, capital ratios remain strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional
risk management. Holding company capital ratios declined from year end, primarily driven by the repurchase of
19.8 million common shares during the quarter at a total cost of $304 million. On March 9, we completed the
common share repurchase program authorized by the company's board of directors in 2019.
In light of our strong capital position and consistent with historical practices, the board approved the company's
27th consecutive annual common dividend increase. The ability to provide a consistent cash return of capitals to
shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success in building the franchise with a long-
term view. We understand the importance it has on the valuation of the company's shares. As a result, one of our
most important objectives is having the capital strength to protect the dividend.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're
ready for questions.

The first question I had was on commercial line utilization rates, what those looked like today maybe versus the
start of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We – so very similar, they've generally been in about a 47%, 48% kind of number. They've gone 40% –
depending on the portfolio, 49%, 50%, really kind of across the board on the different commercial portfolios. Our
middle-market business, banking, utilization is pretty stable. Same with our home equity on the consumer side. So
we've been watching that and we're obviously wanting to monitor that and we've been very pleased with how it's
behaved, actually. I think it's a sign that our customers are in good shape and not panicking and also that they're
comfortable that we will fund if they need it. So it's a good sign.

It's just way too uncertain for everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, lastly, on the securities portfolio, you had really strong growth there. I guess I'm curious what was
the impetus for that. Was it just sort of a temporary parking place for some deposit liquidity coming on the balance
sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. David, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jack. Well, there was a little bit of a backup early in the first quarter in rates and we're getting
a sense that the economy could experience a bit of a slowdown. We certainly didn't have a sense of what would
eventually happen. So, we decided it was more of an asset liability move just to put some duration on the balance
sheet.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Yeah. Well, I mean, there was a significant change, January 1, we were living in the past life, right, which was
somewhat business as usual and expectations for normal growth in the next couple of years, low unemployment
levels, et cetera.
Day two, towards the end of March, obviously, the world had changed. I'd go back and say that besides the
change in economic environment, one of the other changes was that most of the growth in the quarter was in our
mortgage warehouse business which really carried a very small reserve. We kind of broke that out on page 7. So
really the entire provision on day two was COVID-related, not loan growth-related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. But, David, could you share the economic assumptions underlying day two, maybe just GDP...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. Well, we ran a base case scenario which was reflective of a U which is a recovery within the back half of
2020. We also ran other multiple scenarios, an elongated U where recovery didn't occur until the back half of
2021. We also ran what people would call an L, which is basically a multiyear recovery to where we were at the
beginning of the year and then we ran a P as well. And then, the way our models work that those different
scenarios get weighted based on judgment of management.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, okay. But you did call out that you were at risk of another reserve build in 2Q, just given how those
assumptions had changed? Do you think we could see another adjustment similar to the day two, around $23
million you saw this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say it's entirely possible. As you know, almost every day, the economic situation is changing. This
is – it's fluid. Your own bank, when they announced, talked about if it was being redone, some of the statistics
they were citing were substantially different when they went pencils down. I'd say the same is true for us, but not
only are there, I would say all of us getting more concerned about unemployment levels, GDP, for example. But
there's also positive things where we've got the second stimulus bill that's about – the PPP program is going to
start flowing next week. Some of the states are opening up; some states are not. So all – it's much too fluid to give
any real color to what the second quarter provision will look like. But – so that's why our comment is we could see
another large provision in the second quarter and really can't give much more color than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then just one separate question on expenses, I know you guys pulled the full-year guidance. When
you look at expenses where you do have more control over that, less impacted by environmental factors, is there
any reason the prior goal you gave last quarter of $1.19 billion to $1.22 billion of expenses, why that would no
longer be intact?

As always, Steve, it's a good question. What I would say is the fluidity of the situation is the reason that we're
pulling guidance and not giving more clarity. As we see the year unfold, we certainly expect fee income
headwinds, we are waiving a lot of fees at this point. We had fee increases that we had planned that we've now
decided to defer.
Our wealth management business is facing headwinds just because the markets are down. Offsetting that will be
expense reductions. We're thinking about the pace of technology investments will be a bit slower just because
we're all working remotely. Some of what we will wind up doing this year will be technology to support our
employees remotely as well as technologies to help our customers. So, I think our – the way we spend money
going forward the balance of this year and the next will change a bit. But I also think we will do our best to lower
expenses as much as we can relative to fee headwinds as well as margin headwinds.

Yeah. Steve, just one last comment on that is, so this is the quarter that at the beginning of the quarter as Jack
said we completed the systems conversion for United. So, I would like to state that we promised 55% cost saves
in that transaction and we are right on track where we should be.

John P. Barnes A

Hey, Steve. Steve I would just – I don't think that the prior guidance is necessarily that we think of it as
unreasonable right now based on where we are. There are some moving parts that David is trying to describe to
give you a sense that when we pulled total guidance maybe that's less dramatic. And we are – and I don't want to
be misunderstood on the technologies. And we're moving forward on a bunch of projects that we have in place.
But I think David's comment is about pace and when the pace is challenged, then the timing of those expenses
hitting is changed. So, there are different things like that that we really just need to reassess and understand how
we're feeling about.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe, David, just circling back on the baseline economic assumption, can you just share with us what I guess
what your expectations under that are for unemployment and GDP?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, as I said, the most important thing is the variety of scenarios that we ran. So we have GDP across
those scenarios from no growth in 2020 to growth down 6% in 2020 varying by quarter's unemployment rates, for
example, in the second quarter from down 12% to down 16%. Hopefully, that's helpful.
I mean there's – those aren't the only two drivers to our models as you can imagine. Commercial real estate
prices, levels of interest rates, credit spreads, home prices, there's a multitude of metric data that goes into our
model and process. I would – our models – our CECL models are essentially have been developed from our
stress testing models that we've spent seven-plus, eight years, I think, now at this point putting together, building
teams, getting ready to cross the $50 billion mark to be a CCAR bank. So, I would say they're all loan level and
they are well-developed and actually quite sophisticated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. That's good color. I guess one question I had, you talked about the loans that you are retaining
from UBNK that you thought you'd get rid of. What type of loans are those that you're holding on to and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
The ones – I called out $233 million of relationships. They are mostly commercial real estate loans that I would
say originally we didn't understand the full extent of the relationship. As we got a little deeper under the covers,
we do and think there's – they're high quality relationships that have growth potential for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just finally I guess with the broader move in bank stock prices, what's the risk or the chance of a
goodwill impairment charge on the books at all as we look out the rest of the year?

R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
It's a good question. There was no risk in Q1. Our primary driver is obviously our stock price and where we are.
But what I would say is it's really – it's not something we're highly concerned about because when we look at the
goodwill on the books by acquisition, we have nice cushions across those acquisitions and we believe we will be
profitable every quarter through this and that's also a large driver.

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah, good evening, gentlemen. You noted the participation with the CARES Paycheck Protection Program. Just
give us an update in terms of your fundings to date and how much you'd expect to fund from the program and just
curious what you're assuming in terms of fees relates to this and are they going to have a NIM impact as well and
just how you're thinking about actually the funding of the program?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So this is Jack. As I said in the comments, we got approval for $2.1 billion. We funded as of today,
something, just I think a little north will end the day of $1.0 billion. So we funded just about 50%. We have,
actually, through the good thinking of some of our technology folks we've put a bot into what was a manual
process when we started and the pace of closing and funding the loans has picked up markedly. So we're actually
hoping to be fully funded with the first PPP program close to by the end of the week here.
So we feel good about that, strong effort from hundreds of people in our company and a lot of work over the
weekend. So we felt strongly we needed to respond for our customers and we were all in on that. There will be
some margin impacts, the 1% loans. So – and David and crew have been doing some thinking and work,
forecasting on that. I would comment we've also put some additional automation in dealing with this phase two, so
we're also feeling good about continuing to support our customers. We've been focused on our customer base to
this point in the program.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Just a couple other issue or points of reference on that. So about 30% of the loans that we've done are at a 5%
loan origination and servicing fee, about 40% are at 3% and about 30% are at 1%. We've been focused on taking
the apps and getting them funded. And now, I think us and all the banks are starting to think about exactly how
the length of time these loans will be on the books and the impact to fee income and interest income. The fees
that we're paid are actually part of the legislation range, they're part servicing and they're part origination. So if
you really think about them, part of that fee is supposed to be amortized over the life of the loan, which technically
are two years but should be forgiven in eight weeks. And then part is for servicing which you can take upfront.
So I'd say us and everyone else is really getting our head around the margin impact and the fee income impact.
We don't really have a clear answer to that yet. These will also balloon off our balance sheet if they're on at the
end of the quarter. So just thinking forward, I don't think – our thinking would be different than anyone else's from
the point of view. I think we'll all be talking about fee income and margin with and without the PPP loans in the
second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. From a funding perspective, what are you envisioning on that, funding the loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
We'll be funding the loans between probably 15 and 35 basis points. Yeah. I saw something today or last night
that the home loans are actually going to accept these loans as collateral. That's new news. So every bank can
just go under their current capacities or you can use the 35-basis-point facility or you can just fund it as part of
your short-term funding position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jason Bishop Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then just in terms of some of the forbearance actions, just maybe some details in terms of what you're
doing in terms of the forbearance programs on the commercial loan side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. On the commercial loan side, it's roughly 12% of the total commercial book. It varies commercial real estate
and some of the equipment finance areas are most active there. And it does appear to be slowing, I would say
definitely appears to be slowing from what we're being told by the managers and the different business lines. We
had that.

Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Hey. Good evening, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
For the loans you guys talked about on slide 6 which is a nice breakout here, I was just wondering what some of
the underwriting metrics are on those. LTVs, debt service coverage ratios, and whatnot, you have that available.
And if you could talk about what the reserves are you have against these segments, that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I'm going to ask Jeff to talk some about our approach to the underwriting on the different segments and
then David can maybe comment some about reserve levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Hi. This is Jeff. As Jack and David both mentioned earlier, coming into this from a position of strength and
these portfolios would be similar the going-in debt yield and debt service coverage ratios and loan to values were
in definitely the hospitality space and the retail space were on the conservative side, debt yields in the mid-teens,
debt service coverage 1.75 to 2 times. LTVs in the 50% to 60% range on average.
But as David also pointed out, we didn't underwrite to a pandemic which is why having the customer base that
Jack described has been cycle-tested. And in the case of hospitality having multiple hotels within their portfolio
and having been at this for a long time give us comfort that we'll be able to kind of weather the storm, but clearly if
16

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
you have a hotel that has 0% occupancy doesn't matter what your going-in debt yield was. You're going to have
challenges and that's what we're working through.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Great. That's good color. And then on the reserving aspect?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, and Dave, I'd really just point you back to our CECL slides. The dollar reserves, page 7, but then the
allowance to loans by portfolio is on page 8. The commercial allowance of 67 basis points inclusive of the
mortgage warehouse ABL at 8 basis points, retail which under CECL because of the long nature, the long
durations requires a higher allowance at 103 basis points. Total reserves up 77.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Okay. Great. And then you had mentioned a nursing home credit earlier, I was just curious how large that
segment was. And then I know your leverage loan exposure is really low. I just wanted to get a confirmation about
what that number looks like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Jeff, do you want to take a shot at total nursing home exposure, I had that in front of me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yes. So yeah, it's not – given the size of our portfolio, it's not significant. The healthcare vertical that we manage
has about $700 million or $800 million in it. I think nursing homes are maybe a third to less than half of that. The
thing that we've heard most in kind of the senior housing base is on a go-forward basis. They expect occupancy
to fall just because of a lack of people moving in and operating expenses to drift higher because they're having to
increase compensation for their employees and pay for a lot of the PPE purchases in caring for all of the people in
those homes.
But I think here again the portfolio is with large operators who have multiple homes, who do this professionally
and in the line of business. So it's what cycle-tested sponsors. The one nursing home that got called out as part of
our charge-offs was a very old legacy loan not part of this portfolio per se and has been troubled for quite some.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah, meaning like five or eight years it was a unique situation that the state ended up getting involved with as
well. And we worked through with them and finally came to closure. So I would call that one very unique.

Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
That's great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. And with regards to your leverage lending question, we don't really have a sponsor finance private equity
vertical or a group. So we don't do a lot of the private equity sponsor finance lending. I would say our exposure in
that type of businesses is modest. We do have leverage loans, but they're leveraged. They're called leveraged
loans because of the OCC definition, not because it's an underlying sponsor finance type of transaction, and
that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
How big is – how big could that be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
...number is relatively small.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Relatively small.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey J. Tengel A
President, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's less than $1 billion, I believe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
Okay. And maybe just one last one on capital. I know you had originally talked about a target CET1 in the 10% to
10.5% range excluding the buybacks. Now you guys have completed the buyback. It's lower because of that, so
just wondering if you have any kind of revised target there. And then, Tier 1 leverage ratio specifically at 8.4%
now, you've got the PPP loans coming on. I was just wondering how low that can go, what your comfort level is
there, it'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, obviously, both ratios impacted because of the depletion of the buyback and below the original
guidance we put out. We just expect to build from here back to prior levels as quarters unfold. So really no more
color there. We took them down because of the buybacks. Depending on the level of the provision going forward,
that will determine ultimately how much retention of capital we have.
The PPP loans, as I said, may or may not be on the balance sheet come 6/30 just because they are forgiven –
they're forgiven within eight weeks and they're funding now. Just as well as a reminder that all those loans are
18


People’s United Financial, Inc.
(PBCT) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
zero percent risk-weighted for regulatory capital purposes. So the only real effect that they will have is on tangible
common at 6/30. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dave Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading
And I guess the Tier 1 leverage ratio, right?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A

And Collyn, just to be clear, that's not – was out on our website, the 2017 number. That's at 12/31/2019 inclusive
of United.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay, got it. And then, just while we're on that slide, I know you had indicated obviously duration has an
impact on the CECL formula. But just can you give a little bit more color as to what drove the $20 million reduction
in the allocated reserve for C&I?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Sure. So under our previous incurred loss methodology, we included ABL and mortgage warehouse within C&I
and treated it as a homogeneous portfolio. Under CECL, we have a specific model for those two asset classes.
So, yeah, that's why it's approximately $3 billion of loans that only carries a $2.4 million reserve. That's the 8 basis
points that you see on slide 8. So, it's actually interesting. If you backed those loans out as well as the $2.4
million, what you'll see is for the commercial reserve, it would go from 67 basis points to 73 basis points. And if
you did that for the whole allowance, it would take our reserve from 77 to 82 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, okay. Got it. And then just in terms of the loans that you guys have identified, it kind of significantly
impacted still on slide 6. How much of those has been would you say acquired either through some of your
finance acquisitions or through your bank acquisitions over the last five years or so?

So, Collyn, this is Jack. I'll take a crack at that and then, Jeff, if you have anything to add, feel free. We described
the relationships on the hospitality side, those are long-term relationships that have been with People's United for
a long time, so that's 70% of the exposure. And on the retail side, the description of the grocery anchored,
pharmacy, big box, all of those relationships are long-term People's United relationships. We financed, for
instance, a lot of the stop and shop anchored properties throughout Connecticut. We've got couple of customers
that have done a lot of CVS type pharmacy. So, all of that stuff is long-term tenured customers and those are all
the big dollars in those pieces.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly just on the – can we just dig into the equipment finance book
a little bit, so the $5 billion there, maybe just walk through some of the credit metrics? I know obviously
restaurants are within that a little bit, but just sort of how that portfolio is faring and how you see that? I mean,
obviously, the slide gives you kind of maybe day one impact of COVID, but if we're in this longer slowdown from
an economic standpoint, recession, how maybe that equipment finance portfolio will do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So you're asking about restaurants in the equipment finance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Well, just generally – so just the $5 billion, just all of the equipment finance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I get you.

Collyn B. Gilbert Q

No, it's okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
So I would say, and again I'll ask Jeff if he wants to add anything, but so we've kind of got three distinct
businesses in those portfolios. The old PCLC, which is a leasing company we've probably operated within the
company for 25 or 30 years, those are kind of larger, mission-critical pieces of equipment. Many of those
companies have definitely been impacted by the virus, and we've gotten forbearance requests. But many are not.
Many are more insulated, at least now. The – and I would say – I would think of those as kind of cash flow-
focused in the underwriting, higher percentage arm of original loan to values. That's the way that business
functions competitively in the market. And they're typically five-year loans, so you would think of kind of pretty
evenly running out those periods.
The next one is the old Fin Fed, and those guys do more of a smaller companies, variety of cranes, think about
cranes on top of trucks that can move them around to different sizes, some construction equipment
transportation. They have had an incredible record with us. They know their clients really well and they have long-

term relationships. And then LEAF is small ticket item, wide variety of vendors that they work with in different
industries, and then a very tightly controlled credit box that's focused on the Fair Isaac small business module and
then they add a lot of attributes that they work with.
Probably the most – we think one of the quickest ways we can explain the LEAF history with you guys is, these
are – it's a management team that's been working together for 30 years. They've been in the business through
cycles. There's a ton of public information out there about this, securitizations they've done over the years which
is a big part of our underwriting and due diligence on the company. So, again, there's going to be some
companies in there that are going to be affected no doubt, but I think the core going in underwriting approach is
very sound and cycle-tested. So that's the way we're viewing it. I don't know if Jeff...

I was just going to share some historical loss numbers to place what Jack said in perspective. So in Jack's slide
where we talked about the 16 basis points of charge-offs through 2008, well, PCLC, the first one Jack talked
about is included in that because we bound it the whole time. They've averaged over that period of time 29 basis
points of charge-offs. The old Fin Fed, People's United Equipment Finance rebound since 2010. They've
averaged 5 basis points of charge offs because they're so close to the collateral. And then LEAF who we haven't
owned since 2011, but they have public securitizations out over that time period, so from 2011 through last year
their average annual charge-offs were 72 basis points.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Matt.

R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Hi, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
I just wanted to follow that last line of questioning there. So could you remind us of what the size of the overall
LEAF portfolio is? I just want to frame a reference for page 20 where we see a lot of equipment finance loans with
forbearance but not a very large amount of outstanding. I would assume that's a lot of LEAF related loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Yeah. LEAF is – current portfolio is $1.8 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then do you have prior to 2011 for LEAF what they did through the great financial crisis in terms
of charge-offs and the same question for FIF.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. David Rosato A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Well, so Fin Fed rebounded since 2010. So, no, I don't have their data prior to 2010. For LEAF, some of that
information is publicly available because they had public securitizations outstanding. We don't usually reference
that because the business model coming right out of the crisis was different than what it was since 2011, so it's
not really applicable. When we went through some of that early on, their charge-off history averaged about 90 to
95 basis points.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. And could you remind...

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 23-Apr-2020
Matt, this is Jack. I just want to make sure you don't – as I heard how you started that out and it is not accurate
that the majority of forbearance requests in the leasing business are all on LEAF at all. It's quite mixed across the
board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Understood. Last question for me. You mentioned assets under discretionary management. Obviously,
post-quarter that could change. Do you have what that number is down to as of April versus at quarter – what you
used for the first quarter? I know sometimes that's marked off of an earlier part in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
I don't. We can come back to you with that, Matt. I just – we don't have it available right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Understood. Okay. I appreciate it. That's all I had. Thank you.

You're welcome.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to
turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John P. Barnes
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, People's United Financial, Inc.
Thank you, operator. While the economic impact of the pandemic will meaningfully affect the remainder of the
year, our first quarter performance was strong. The company entered despite it is well positioned. We are
confident in the strength of our franchise, with this excellent risk management capability, deep customer
relationships, diversified business mix and strong liquidity and capital levels, People's United will successfully
navigate in this uncertain time and play a critical role in supporting the financial health of individuals, businesses,
and communities throughout the crisis and beyond.
Thank you all. Stay safe, and have a good night.

disconnect. Good day.
