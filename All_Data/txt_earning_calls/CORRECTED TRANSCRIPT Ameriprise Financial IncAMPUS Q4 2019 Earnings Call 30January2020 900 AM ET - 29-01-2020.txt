Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. On the
call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following
their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you will see a
discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-
GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliations of
non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that
we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and
overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be
materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2019 earnings release, our

2018 Annual Report to shareholders, our 2018 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise
these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you see
our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by
reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.
Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
Additionally, we are providing an annual update to our Long Term Care disclosures as an appendix to the slides
posted on our website today.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James Michael Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Ameriprise delivered an excellent fourth quarter, completing a very good
year. As many of you know, we held our Investor Day in November to give you an even deeper understanding of
our go-to-market strategies and long-term growth plans. I want to thank everyone who attended. We enjoyed our
conversation with you.
Regarding our growth strategy, as we discussed, there are four key areas driving our momentum. First, we have a
significant opportunity to build on our strong position and further grow as a wealth management leader with deep
client relationships. Second, we're transforming our Global Asset Management business to meet the important
needs for active management. Third, we're managing well developed insurance and annuity books of business
that generate significant, consistent free cash flow. And finally, Ameriprise is delivering profitable growth, has a
sound balance sheet and is generating a high return for shareholders.
On our call today, I'll discuss our results, the operating environment, and our progress executing the growth
drivers we've outlined at Investor Day. Turning to the markets, US equities reached yet another record-high and
our average weighted equity index that reflects the mix of assets we manage finished up strongly for the year. As
you know, the Fed interest rate cuts in 2019 are a headwind. And yesterday, the Fed said that interest rates
remain unchanged.
As January comes to a close, equity markets remain strong, but with a pick-up in volatility. We cannot predict the
year or market cycles, but with deep client relationships, good cash flows, and a strong balance sheet, Ameriprise
is built to manage these cycles and emerge stronger.
Now, let's discuss the quarter. On a consolidated level, fourth quarter results were quite good compared to a year
ago. On an adjusted operating basis, we delivered revenue growth of 6%, excluding Auto & Home revenue in the
year-ago period; solid EPS growth, up 11%, even after absorbing some additional expenses in Corporate; a
return on equity of 38.6%, ex AOCI and unlocking, which remains well above many peers; and with the sale of the
Auto & Home business, we generated $161 million in net benefit on a full year GAAP pre-tax basis. Our assets
under management and administration reached a new high, up 18% to $973 billion. We also achieved new
records in Wealth Management for retail client assets and advisor productivity that I'll discuss further.
With that, let's now turn to our growth engine, Advice & Wealth Management. We delivered solid revenue and
earnings growth in the fourth quarter, even with significant decline in short-term interest rates. Margin in AWM
was nearly 23% and continues to be among the best in Wealth Management. I'm pleased with how we're
executing our priorities. We're growing our client base, serving more affluent investors and deepening client

relationships. It all starts with the large and compelling market that we're concentrating on. Responsible investors
with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets. They're looking for comprehensive advice and strong digital
capabilities from an advisor and a firm that they trust. Ameriprise is uniquely positioned to serve this market and
it's translating into terrific results.
We had an excellent year in Advice & Wealth Management, including some nice fourth quarter highlights. Client
assets were up 19%. Our fee-based advisory business continues to stand out with more than $4 billion of in-flows
into advisory in the quarter. This brings total wrap assets to $318 billion, a 26% increase. Importantly, we had
strong client acquisition results in the quarter, particularly in our affluent target market, and we saw good pick-up
in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning relationships. And in the quarter,
advisor productivity increased 6% as advisors leverage the extensive support we offer to help them grow.
In Recruiting, we had another good year. We continue to attract experienced advisors from across the industry. In
addition, another 63 advisors joined us. And it's one of the best quarters for recruiting large production practices.
What's behind our continued success? The deep, long-lasting relationships we work diligently [indiscernible]
(07:08) with clients, and we're using a goal-based advice expertise and our enhanced client experience to deepen
these relationships even further. We're also leveraging our recent investments to drive future growth.
Here are some updates. We continue to increase uptake of our digitally-enabled advice experience to even more
clients. We completed the rollout of our Custom Advisory Relationship Program. We finished the conversion of
our new customer relationship management platform. And we're growing the Ameriprise Bank. We brought more
than $1 billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to
close to $4 billion. And we will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet.
This year, we will be adding additional capabilities, including a mortgage program, pledge loans, and a savings
deposit product. I also like to point out that outside of the bank, Ameriprise Wealth Management expenses will
come back to more normalized levels in 2020.
We also continue to receive important recognition in the industry. Ameriprise was recently certified by J.D. Power
for providing an outstanding customer service experience. Our teams work hard to deliver industry-leading
service, so this means a lot.
I'll leave you with this takeaway. With our advice value proposition and the investments we've made, we have a
great opportunity to continue to grow in the Wealth Management business. I'm energized by the opportunity we
have in front of us.
Now, I will turn to our I&A businesses. These are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability.
We're focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs while continuing to evolve
our solution mix. In the quarter, we generated $185 million in adjusted operating earnings for the Protection and
Annuity businesses, in line with our expectations. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow.
In terms of annuity sales, total variable annuity cash sales were up when compared to a slower quarter last year.
And for the year, sales were in our typical range of about $4 billion. This month, we launched our structured
solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of Ameriprise clients. We expect this will help
shift even more of our books away from products with guarantees.
Fixed annuity sales were down year-over-year, in line with our plan. In Protection, we focused on continuing to
shift from IUL to VUL, where we had a very strong growth in VUL sales compared to last year. Overall, life

insurance in force remained stable at $195 billion. As always, we're focused on managing risks appropriately and
ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients and the environment. We will also continue to evaluate
further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year.
Moving to Asset Management, earnings were strong, and flows continued to improve. We remain focused on
serving client needs and pursuing long-term growth opportunities in key areas. Columbia Threadneedle ended the
quarter with $494 billion in assets under management, up 15% on improving flows and positive markets. And the
earnings contribution to Ameriprise remained good.
We're making good progress executing on our strategy, and you can see that in our flow picture. We generated
$3.3 billion in net inflows in the quarter, which was up $8 billion from last year. This is our third consecutive
quarter of improved flows. Investment performance was excellent in 2019 across equities, fixed income, and
asset allocation portfolios. On an asset-weighted basis for our Columbia Funds, over 75% are above median for
one, three, and five-year time frames. For Threadneedle Funds, over 80% are beating their benchmarks for those
same time periods. And we're seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the
way.
In US retail, we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight broker-dealer partner firms, and
gross sales in our key strategies are good. Our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong. In fact, of the 17 active
firms we benchmarked, we were in the top five and one of the few that were net positive for the quarter. And in
fixed income, we continue to garner good flows, and we feel that we can improve even further. We're seeing a
particular strength in our income franchise. For example, our dividend income, strategic income, and mortgage
opportunity funds generated more than $2.2 billion in combined net inflows in the quarter.
In EMEA retail, with Brexit now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the UK, sentiment in Europe has
improved. Net flows improved by more than $2 billion from last year. We're making good progress. In fact, we
were net inflows in nearly all of our key markets in Europe, now that we have built out our CCAP product range.
And in global institutional, net inflows improved by more than $2 billion ex parent to a net outflow of $1 billion.
We're gaining traction in a number of areas that we talked to you about in November. It was another good quarter
in Asset Management. We have a strong product lineup, excellent performance and global reach, and we're
focused on executing well to maintain our momentum.
Now, let me turn to our final key area of focus, our capital strength, which is outstanding. Last quarter, I
highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the Auto & Home business
in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses. Ultimately, we ended the year at
$2.2 billion of excess capital. In the fourth quarter, as a continuation of our strong return of capital, we returned
125% of operating earnings through the pick-up in the pace of our buyback. And for the year, we reduced our
overall share count by 8%.
To summarize, it was an excellent quarter and year for Ameriprise. We're in a strong position. Later this year will
mark our 15th anniversary as an independent publicly-traded company. We're incredibly proud of what we've
accomplished. Importantly, we're proud of how we're recognized for our client service, our records of
outperformance, and how we consistently deliver for shareholders. We're poised and energized to build on our
record of performance and growth.
Now, Walter will discuss the financials in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Walter?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics, with
adjusted operating EPS up 11% to $4.20. This was supported by strong 6% revenue growth, excluding the Auto &
Home business that we sold in the quarter. The quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong.
However, within the Corporate segment, there were a few timing-related expense items that I'd like to explain.
First, we incurred higher than normal impairments in our low income housing portfolio, totaling $25 million. The
portfolio continues to perform well, and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax
benefits. Second, as part of our reengineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base going into
2020, we took an elevated level of severance charges in the quarter of $11 million. This action positions us well
moving into 2020.
Finally, we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter, which required us to mark-to-market some of
the previously issued share-based compensation awards. This was a $6 million absolute impact in the quarter,
but an $18 million variance year-over-year. Going forward, we expect our Corporate segment losses to return to
the $70 million range.
On October 1, we closed the sale of Auto & Home to American Family. The transaction generated a net benefit of
$161 million over the course of the year, but is not recognized within our operating results. We returned 125% of
earnings to shareholders in the quarter and 110% for the year based upon the sale of Auto & Home and the
changes in our risk profile.
We entered 2020 with strong balance sheet fundamentals, with $2.2 billion in excess capital and a lower risk
profile, with Long Term Care continuing to perform well, which you can see in the appendix. In 2020, we will
evaluate reducing leverage, while remaining committed to return capital at a pace of 100% plus.
Let's turn to page 6. As I mentioned, adjusted operating net revenue was up 6% to $3 billion after excluding Auto
& Home from the prior-year period. Revenue growth was driven by Advice & Wealth Management and Asset
Management. In Advice & Wealth Management, we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improved
transactional activity, driving an 8% increase in revenue. In Asset Management, revenues grew 9% including
strong performance fees. Annuities and Protection revenue was essentially flat. In summary, we delivered strong
EPS growth of 11% and a return on equity of nearly 39%.
Turning to slide 7, you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with Advice & Wealth Management
generating over half of the company's earnings, up from 33% five years ago. This profitability improvement has
been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses, while still investing for future growth.
We've seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we focus
substantial investments in areas of opportunity within Wealth Management business.
Advice & Wealth Management continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators, as you can see on
slide 8. Advice & Wealth Management adjusted operating net revenues grew 8%. Wrap assets were up 26% to
$318 billion, with net inflows of $4.4 billion in the quarter. Transactional activity also increased 5% year-over-year.
We had a good quarter for experienced advisor recruiting, with 63 advisors joining us from other firms in the
quarter, with much higher trailing 12-month productivity, and market-levels improved nicely.
Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were up 5%, or $19 million in the face of a $22 million headwind related to
recent Fed rate cuts. A strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short-

term interest rates. G&A increased 6% excluding the bank, consistent with expectations. We are continuing to
make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume-related expenses, given strong activity
levels. Our expectation is that G&A growth, excluding the bank, will be in the range of 3% to 4%. Finally, our
margin was solid at 22.6%, and we expect we can maintain it in this range.
Let's turn to Asset Management on page 9. In the quarter, we saw a substantial $8 billion improvement, with net
inflows of $3.3 billion. Excluding former parent-related flows, net inflows were $4.2 billion, benefiting from
continued improvement in retail in North America and Europe as well as from reinvested dividends.
From a financial perspective, the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory. Asset Management continues
to generate substantial revenue and pre-tax adjusted operating earnings for Ameriprise. Pre-tax adjusted
operating revenue was up 9% to $770 million, driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation, with
lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows.
Underlying expenses remain well managed. Within the quarter, expenses were impacted by elevated
performance fee and year-end timing-related compensation adjustments as well as a higher distribution expense
associated with revenue growth. Margins in the quarter were 36%, remaining in our target range of 35% to 39%.
Turning to page 10, results in Annuities and Protection are solid. Annuities continued to perform in line with
expectations, with very consistent profitability. We saw good improvement in variable annuity sales, up 9% in the
quarter, though still down for the full year. We have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first
quarter that will further diversify our offering away from living benefit features. And our variable annuity net
amount of risk still remains one of the lowest in the industry. Protection earnings were down slightly to $65 million.
Claims remained in line with expectations.
Now, let's move to balance sheet on slide 11. We accelerated the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2019,
with $2.4 billion returned via buybacks and dividends. This is a continuation of our long-standing track record of
capital return. In fact, over the past 10 years, we have returned over $18 billion to shareholders and reduced our
diluted share count by approximately 50%. We continued to generate substantial free cash flow, which, along with
excellent balance sheet fundamentals, will support continued capital return.
We entered 2020 from a position of strength with $2.2 billion of excess capital. We remain committed to returning
capital to shareholders, assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business
mix, and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities.
With that, we will take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey. Good morning. So, I'm looking at the advisor count, and you're at 9,871. It's roughly flattish with the last
year's number. Could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into 2020 and the productivity
of those advisors? I know revenue per advisor was up 6% year-over-year, a lot of moving parts there. So, how do
you see that evolving in 2020 as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, we think that the advisor count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward. We actually netted out a
number of advisors in the IPI area and others as we reformed them, restructured that channel as well as in some
of the central sites as we shifted things around, but we actually feel good about the recruitment. We're actually
focused a bit more on higher productivity, and so the average productivity of the people who are leaving us are
still much lower. So, we focus mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people we're bringing in.
But I think the advisor count should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of
the year. And I feel good about the type of productivity we're bringing in and the recruitment end and the ramping
up of the people who are here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And staying on Advice & Wealth, fee rates, they were around 108 basis points by our calculation in the
quarter, and that's kind of versus the recent 109 to 111-basis-point range over the last two years or so. And so, I
don't know, is that a function of moving up market? And why is that? And where do you see the fees kind of
shaking out in 2020 and 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think it's part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels, where
then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels managing are a bit higher. And so that's actually – it's a good
positive thing for us. I mean, our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong, continues to be good and consistent,
and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent. And we're probably going to embark on something this
year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels, so I think that's favorable for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And one last quick one, 110% payout ratio, 110% in 2019, $2.2 billion of excess capital, could you get that
ratio even higher in 2020?

Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We could, but the answer is, I think, as Jim said at the Investor Day, we're targeting at this stage 100% plus. But
we are certainly monitoring that and evaluating it, Andrew, as we do. But certainly we have the generation
capacity, and we'll be evaluating that as we move forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. A question related to the G&A expenses. I think, in Jim
and Walter's prepared remarks, you talked about expenses should normalize in 2020. And I think specifically in
A&WM, the G&A expenses, excluding the bank, would be kind of 3% to 5% growth. But, I guess, when we look at
the overall enterprise, how should we think about the expenses in general? And then also, how much of a
banking-related expense do you anticipate for A&WM?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So, I think, as we indicated, yes, I think what you said for AWM, the expense range, after normalizing for
the bank, it would be in the 3% to 5% range. As it relates to AMP, it is lower than that, and it normally would be in
the range of 2%, in that range. So, we anticipate that will continue as we look, as we evaluate it, but that is what is
a reasonably good expectation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. So, including the bank or AMP, overall AMP G&A expenses would be in the 2% range. Is that what you're
suggesting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The bank will be above that because we normalize for it. At the AWM level, it's about 200 basis points if you add
for the bank. So, [indiscernible] (27:41) it'll be a little less for AMP because of the AMP size, the expense base will
be neutralized and [indiscernible] (27:47) gives a little less impact, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, again, in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block. It doesn't look
like that the lower interest rate right now affects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions. Is
that a fair statement? And then also, can you remind us how much statutory capital that you have right now
backing that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, listen, the interest rates do affect it, but we do believe there is a – we're evaluating that there is
potential viability, and certainly pursuing fixed annuity reinsurance. And we're in discussions, and we evaluate
that. Just as a general range, it's probably around in the area of $750 million to $800 million that we can free up.

Operator: Our following question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one within the Asset Management business, a follow-up on the prepared
remarks. You touched upon seeing improving investor sentiment within the UK, EMEA region due to Brexit clarity.
Wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in net fund flows this year due to the increase in
clarity. And, perhaps, you could just tell us which products, investment products, you're potentially gaining from
this improving sentiment. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So, I think you're more explicitly asking about UK and Europe, our EMEA business. Yes. We saw a nice
improvement bounce-back occurring in the fourth quarter, moving from some negative in the first month of the
quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter, and we see that continuing.
Europe was actually positive for us, good. The UK was still coming back, but was still a bit weaker. But we feel
like that will start to change and [ph] remedying (29:56) now that they've gone through the elections at the end of
the year. So, we're reasonably optimistic that there [ph] would be (30:06) with a little less uncertainty. I mean,
there's still uncertainty to the extent of what is the trade agreement and things at the end of the year, but the
people in London are feeling better and feel like the business can come back there and the appetite would
increase.
And we have a good lineup. I mean, we have excellent performance in our funds. UK equity-type products are
really good. We've gained, even in a negative year, flows there. And we now have a fuller line of products in the
CCAP range in Europe. And that bodes well for us as there's a pick-up, and we're seeing that pick up in things
like European equities and various things like that. So, we're positive on that to be an improvement this year.

Great. And just one follow-up, if I may. Looking at the former parent company-related outflows, looking back over
the past year or so, net outflows related to that have been declining. Just wondering whether we would expect a
similar kind of trajectory going forward, or just wanted to get your thoughts there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think we've seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and the outflow from our relationship
here. The Zurich activity has been pretty consistent. Once in a while they'll have a pension that closes, and
there's some lumpiness, but it's pretty much been running like what we've seen from quarter-to-quarter just based
on the drawdown of these closed books and assets.
But as I said, the assets that remain there, through a combination of appreciation and even some difference in
some of the products that we replaced that have a bit higher fee, the revenue gets offset even though the flow
negatives in that book is there, so. But I would probably say it's been running that way consistently for a while, so
I don't see much change there from a flow, but the revenue has been pretty stable.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Bakewell Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Deposit volume in 4Q 2019 for VAs was the highest since 2Q 2018. Thought it was somewhat surprising
given the decline in rates during the year and associated re-pricing activity. Can you talk about your positioning in
the distribution environment there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We did see a bit more of a pick-up. I mean, a year ago this quarter, it was a slower period for us, but we
saw a bit more activity towards the end of the year. We actually just in the end of this month, we just launched our
structured annuity product, and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and
shift some of the business from the guarantee product.
I mean, we still sell a reasonable portion of annuities without living benefits as well, which is good, so we're not
looking for substantial growth. But we're looking for probably a bit more growth but also a shift to now some of the
structured product as well, which is good for us. So, we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight
growth, which is good, and the mix improving. So, that's what we're probably seeing right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Bakewell Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Oh, great. And my follow-up, does Brexit clarity change your view around M&A for Asset Management, as I
believe the fee rate for retail is a bit higher in EMEA than in the US?

Well, we want to continue to grow in EMEA and Europe to the point you referenced based on fee rates and the
use of active as well. So, we keep our eye out for opportunities, but we actually feel like some of the investments
we're making and the expansion of resources that we're putting on the continent gives us some opportunity for
further growth there as well.

Operator: Our following question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just a question on the AWM growth. Just looking at page 13 of the supplement, it looks like total
client AUM versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower. Just curious, are you seeing outflows in the non-
wrap business? And overall, how is that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, looking at the client flows, they're still pretty – very good. So, they are in excess of the $4 billion. I don't
know exactly what the ins and outs, there's some ins and outs, but a shift between the non-wrap to wrap has
slowed a lot. I mean, it's sort of leveled out. I can't tell you, like, from period to period, it might be slight, but the net
of the effect of what those flows are, are gross client, net client inflows in total. So, it's within that realm. I would
probably say with the fourth quarter, with just the markets being where they were, I probably think activity would
slow it a little more for investment purposes just because people were waiting for the next shoe to drop, but I think
it's been pretty stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
So, Jim, just following up on that, would you say overall flows into the complex from a total client assets would be
close to the $4 billion mark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
It's north of $4 billion, but in that range in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. That's helpful. And then how should we think about total capital return? I mean, I know you've returned
more than the 90%, certainly, last year, you're sitting on substantial excess as we stand today. How are you
thinking about utilization of the excess? Are you thinking more strategic M&A? Or are there opportunities out
there? And then maybe doing more buybacks if nothing – if you don't find anything? Like, where are you leaning
now more toward with deployment of that excess particularly after the PNC Capital freed a significant amount up?

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, as you saw, we did pick up the buyback, as we said. Walter just mentioned that we're probably looking to
continue, usually saying 90% to 100%, we're saying probably 100% plus at this point in time, not knowing the
world and et cetera. But if things present good opportunities for additional, we do that. But we constantly monitor.
The cash flow continues to be quite good and strong.
As Walter also said, we're probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year. So, I think buyback
still would be probably the main return mechanism. We will look presenting to the board about a dividend increase
again this year, consistent with all the years that we've done that. And we always look at some M&A strategically
to fit in. But that depends on opportunities that may come along or not, but we have enough capital flexibility that
that should not affect our buyback trajectory.

Operator: Our following question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start with the A&WM margin, so if the Fed is on hold now, is the impact of
what they did last year in terms of rate cuts sort of fully baked into the 22.6% margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. Basically it is. Small deviation, but basically it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And then at Investor Day, I mean I don't want to nitpick here, but you talked about a 20% plus margin in A&WM.
On this call, you're saying you could maintain at 22.6%. Is there sort of a change in how you're thinking about that
margin relative to what you told us at Investor Day?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. Not at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then the last one I had is on the bank. I think we have a good sense of what the expenses are, but can
you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are? And how you expect that to progress as we move through
2020?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, as we indicated, we had a small profit in 2019, and we do expect with the launches of different products
and adding more transfer of sweep money over, the revenues will grow. Obviously, this is a challenging market
for investments, but on that base, we do see the revenues growing and us increasing our profitability in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q

Do you have a sense of the revenue base, though, right now from the bank?

Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Let me – I don't want to guess at it, so let us get back to you and I'll get it to you.

Operator: Our following question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Thank you. A couple of follow-ups on Advice & Wealth sort of along the same line as Suneet's questions. I
guess, first, would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the Fed remains on hold? Or are
there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. I don't believe that we see any. Obviously we're constantly monitoring and measuring, but no, we don't see
any at this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. And then Morgan Stanley recently provided a target of getting its Wealth Management business margins to
the 28% to 30% range over the next two years. And I realize there are differences between its business and
yours, but do you see getting to kind of a mid-20% margin as something that may be achievable over the
intermediate term as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say this, I mean, one of the things very clearly is you have sort of compressed rates out there with
what the Fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously, where based on
their investments and other things like the wirehouses with their banking entities and the use of that. But I would
actually say if you get a bit better in some of the yield curve or some pick-up a little better on some of the longer
rates, not substantially, I think you can see with what we're shifting into the bank with the development going

through the bank. But that could be adding to margins even if the Fed maintained rates right now, so to speak,
depending on what happens in the larger climate. But we're ramping up the bank in a period when those things
are pretty compressed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
But we do feel good about it because it gives us the opportunity if things normalize a little better again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Got it. Thank you. And is there a correlation between productivity and margin? Or does productivity just help drive
revenues but kind of your payouts stay the same, and it's sort of margin-neutral?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, the productivity over the years have definitely – I mean, you can see our margins have gone up pretty
tremendously. We do still have sort of an independent and an employee base. The employee margins have
increased nicely. Our independents are quite good. And so we have added to margin based upon the productivity
increase and the business growth, and I don't see that changing substantially.
I think what we're just managing is you had spurts in markets and other things, so we're just averaging that out
right now. But as Walter said, our expense growth should come down a bit outside of the bank back to more
normalized levels. So, we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time. But again, things are
– with the environment, you can't always predict that and what the impact may be in the short term.

Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Certainly. Thank you for the comments.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking a couple of questions here. I have a few, on AWM mostly. So, I guess, first, Walter,
is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income you expect to generate at the bank in
2020, and sort of what that contemplates? In other words, are there more deposits you're going to move from
sweep or whatever you move that's enough to kind of just put them into loans or other things you guys are doing
at the bank? It's my first question.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
I guess, let me, first, since we started the bank midyear, obviously we'll get the calendarization effects, so that
[indiscernible] (43:34) increase on that basis. We will be increasing certainly, as I indicated, the sweep flows into
the bank, so that will. But again, as Jim was saying, in this market, the rates are fairly constricted, and we are
certainly looking at launching and having more emphasis on our privileged loan program and certainly getting into
a deposit program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. But no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars you expect to get out of the bank this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. Not exactly. Again, [indiscernible] (44:11). We're not forecasting, but certainly there will be an increase. And
again, we're assuming an increase in profitability, but I don't have the exact correlation. I mean...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And Alex, we're forming – as we've started to ramp up the bank, the shift in the sweep, looking at the current
environment and regarding both our lending and our investment strategy, the rollout of some of the products this
year, we will be forming that, and as that gets more informed, we will be chatting with you and informing you as
well. So, we're just at the early stages of that. But all the groundwork, all the foundational elements, even the
initial shift in, the launch of the credit card, the initial sweeps, et cetera, have taken place. So, we're right on track
to our plans, but the second level of that will be forming as we go in through this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of the asset growth, so at a high level, everything you guys are talking about
sounds great in terms of recruiting, higher productivity, et cetera. When we look at the wrap flows this year,
they've decelerated versus last year despite the fact that what feels like has been a very robust environment for
the industry as well as some of your peers. So, what's been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year? What
do you think is a reasonable either dollar amount or organic growth you expect to get out of that over the next kind
of 12 to 24 months? And then when you look, I guess, at the fee rate on wrap accounts, that's also been coming
down for the last couple of years. So, kind of help us reconcile all those three, maybe. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We don't really see that what you're saying, per se. I know the wrap account in the previous year or two
were a bit higher, but remember that was part of an industry shift. We were part of that moving with the DOL and
activities and accelerating some of that transfer. But from an organic level, as I've said, $4.4 billion is still pretty
nicely organically growth, and we see that continuing.

We feel like our fee rates are pretty good, as you've said. As we continue to move up markets, some of the fees
will be lower naturally based upon pricing. But, no, I don't see – it could move slightly from what we've said, but I
don't see a slowdown, per se. Our client activity is good, but we do a lot more business than wrap.
And so, importantly, it's not just a wrap business, per se. We try to do more comprehensive business, but I feel
that that's not necessarily I see a slowing. I see things go period to period, but I think over the longer term, we feel
pretty good about it. And we think that that will continue. And our wrap balances are up 26% year-over-year, so
I'm not sure we're out of line in anything in the industry. There may be some further shift for some people where
they were behind on it and accelerating it, but we've always had a good, strong wrap business.
