Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions second quarter 2024 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-
level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement
disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These
disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A.
I will now turn the call over to John.

John M. Turner, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today.
This morning, we reported strong second quarter earnings of $477 million, resulting in earnings per share of
$0.52. For the second quarter, total revenue remained relatively stable at $1.7 billion on a reported basis and $1.8
billion on an adjusted basis, as net interest income remained resilient and fee revenue declined modestly
compared to the first quarter.
As expected, adjusted non-interest expenses declined quarter-over-quarter and are expected to remain at this
approximate level for the remainder of the year. Average and ending loans remained relatively stable quarter-
over-quarter, reflecting modest customer demand, continued focus on clients' selectivity and pay downs in the
portfolio. Average deposits also remain relatively stable, while ending deposits declined modestly during the
quarter, consistent with seasonal tax-related patterns. We experienced broad-based improvement in overall asset
quality this quarter. Non-performing and business services criticized loans as well as net charge-offs improved
sequentially.
In summary, we're proud of our second quarter results driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan.
We have a great plan and the investments we're making in talent, technology and in products and services are
positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve. Our footprint continues to provide us with
significant opportunities. While we are experiencing more competition in our markets, our long-standing presence,
commitment to communities and the favorable brand we built over many years, positions us well. As long as we
remain focused on execution, I have no doubt that we can continue generating top-quartile results.
Now David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
David J. Turner, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans remain relatively stable on a
sequential quarter basis. Within the business portfolio, while average loans remained relatively stable, ending
loans increased 1%.
Despite near-term macroeconomic and political uncertainty, pipelines are beginning to rebuild. Average consumer
loans also remained stable as modest growth in residential mortgage and consumer credit card were offset by
declines in home equity and other miscellaneous consumer loans. We continue to expect 2024 average loans to
be stable to down modestly compared to 2023.
From a deposit standpoint, deposits remained relatively stable on an average basis, while ending balances
declined 2%. These declines in the second quarter reflect anticipated tax seasonality. Having largely returned to
pre-pandemic patterns, we expect relative stability in deposits, which is typical for summer and early fall.
As expected, deposit remixing has slowed, competitive pricing and customer demand for promotional products
has stabilized. Over the second quarter, the proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits relative to total deposits
has remained steady in the low 30% range.
Now let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income increased modestly during the quarter, outperforming
our expectations. The increase reflects stabilizing deposit trends and asset yield expansion. Also exceeding
expectations, the net interest margin declined only 4 basis points, resulting primarily from higher average cash
levels. As expected, deposit remixing and cost increases slowed meaningfully in the quarter.
The full cycle interest-bearing deposit beta remained stable at 43% and we continue to expect a mid-40% deposit
beta will be the peak this cycle. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of fixed rate loans and
securities at current higher rate levels. This includes the repositioning of approximately $1 billion of securities late
in the quarter, with an estimated payback period of 2.6 years relative to the $50 million pre-tax loss recorded this
quarter.
Following our successful $750 million debt issuance in June, we used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of
securities with a similar duration in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster
liquidity. We believe net interest income has reached an inflection point and is expected to grow over the second
half of the year, as deposit trends continue to improve and the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover persist.
As we move further into 2024, a stabilizing deposit and funding environment, along with securities repositioning
and favorable debt issuance levels, have pushed our expectation for net interest income towards the upper end of
our $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion range. This narrow range portrays a well-protected profile under a wide array of
possible economic outcomes.
Now, let's take a look at fee revenue performance this quarter. Adjusted non-interest income declined 3%, driven
primarily by lower capital markets and mortgage income. If you recall, capital markets experienced seasonally
elevated activity in the first quarter as several deals were pushed from the fourth quarter of 2023.
Over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment, we expect our capital markets business can
consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately $100 million. But in the near term, we expect it will run
around $70 million to $80 million per quarter. The decline in mortgage income was primarily driven by positive $6
million adjustment to the company's mortgage pipeline valuation in the first quarter that did not repeat.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
While modestly lower versus the seasonally high first quarter, Treasury Management continues to perform
exceptionally well. Versus the second quarter of last year, Treasury Management's client base has increased 6%,
while total revenue is up 8%. Helping to offset this quarter's fee income declines, Wealth Management increased
3% to a new quarterly record, reflecting increased sales activity and stronger markets. Based on the strong first
half of the year, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted non-interest income to be at the top end of our $2.3 billion
to $2.4 billion range.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 6% compared to the prior
quarter, driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits, occupancy and professional fees. The improvement in
salaries and benefits was attributable primarily to lower base salaries and seasonally higher HR-related expenses
in the first quarter. Operational losses also decreased during the quarter and current activity continues to
normalize within expected levels. We continue to expect full-year 2024 operational losses to be approximately
$100 million.
We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue
focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend.
Based on results through the first half of the year, including outperformance in revenue and our expectation to be
towards the top end of our previously provided full-year revenue ranges, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted
non-interest expenses to be between $4.15 billion and $4.2 billion.
Regarding asset quality, as John indicated, overall credit performance improved during the quarter. Provision
expense was essentially equal to net charge-offs at $102 million, and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio
remained relatively stable at 1.78%. We expect full-year 2024 net charge-offs to be towards upper end of our 40-
basis-point to 50-basis-point range attributable to a few large credits within our higher risk portfolios. However,
those losses are fully reserved for. Assuming stable loan balances and a relatively stable economic outlook, we
expect our ACL ratio to remain flat to declining over the second half of the year.
Let's turn to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter with an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%,
while executing $87 million in share repurchases and $220 million in common dividends during the quarter. Earlier
this week, the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.25 per share, a 4% increase
over the second quarter. This increase is in addition to the 20% increase last year, representing three consecutive
years of robust dividend growth, well supported by underlying financial performance.
Additionally, we received notification of our supervisory capital stress test results, including the preliminary Stress
Capital Buffer, which will remain at 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2024 through the third quarter of 2025. We
expect to maintain our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio consistent with current levels over the near term. This level will
provide sufficient flexibility to meet proposed regulatory changes along the implementation timeline while
supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase
shares commensurate with earnings.
With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning guys. Maybe just walk through some of the key drivers of the updated NII guidance. You
know, you're expecting some nice growth in the second half and given that the Fed cuts won't be a material
driver. Maybe just talk a little bit about the magnitude of the growth that you're expecting. And can you maintain
that pace beyond the second half? And what does all this mean for where you think the margin can head over the
medium term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, as we had mentioned last quarter, we're neutral to short term rates. And so the benefit that we see for
this quarter and then going forward is how we controlled our deposit costs. So, our interest-bearing costs were up
3 basis points. So the front book, back book benefit that we're getting is when you add securities and loans, about
call it 175 basis points is now overwhelming the change in deposit costs and we expect that to continue for the
rest of the year.
So, we don't really need any cuts to help that. If we get them, we get them but we're neutral to that. So, we think
the driver really going forward in addition to what I just mentioned, will be balance sheet growth. And so we think
that can help us continue to grow NII. And when you look at all that, we felt comfortable saying we'd be at the
upper end of our range.
We also did a repositioning trade and that'll help us march towards the upper end as well. So, we think we're in
pretty good shape. We get a little bit of loan growth in the back half of the year. It sets us up nicely for 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe as a follow-up on the expenses, the increase in expenses being somewhat commensurate with the
increase in revenue. So can you maybe just parse out how much of the increase in expenses was driven by better
revenues? And is there maybe a pull forward of some expenses from next year in order to position you for
improved positive operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Really, the increase is attributable to the expected increase in revenue, both NII and NIR that you mentioned, our
expectations for that for the year being at the upper end of our ranges. That's the primary driver. Also impacting

the full year, we have about $20 million in expenses associated with market value adjustments on HR assets. And
so that is what it is. We'll see if that reverses or not. And to a lesser extent, we experienced some modest
incremental increases in the first half of the year and the opportunities to offset that aren't likely. So, it's important
when you consider all this, our revenue and expense, that we are firmly committed to generating positive
operating leverage over the back half of 2024.

question.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everyone. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe at the top level, you could please
speak to kind of the competitive backdrop for commercial lending. I mean, it seems like it's tough everywhere, but
it seems like everyone appropriately wants to be in the southeast. So, maybe just the overall competitive
landscape. And then, maybe if you could also please highlight, just sort of in your own words or thoughts what it
would take to generate better commercial loan demand at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it is competitive. You're right. We're in great markets. We talk about that a lot and as a result of that,
we're seeing more and more competition. We think we're competing well. We believe our business is largely
about the quality of our people, the execution of our plan, providing unique ideas and solutions to customers.
Those things differentiate us and fundamentally in our business, we think it is about talent. We continue to recruit
across our markets and are having some good success doing that. As a result, we're seeing nice growth in our
commercial middle market business, offset by declines in some of our specialized industries groups and in
investor real estate, as you might imagine, as those portfolios pay down.
But, all in all, activity is still somewhat muted. Customers remain cautious, given some concern about inflation
cost, the political environment, just general uncertainty but activity is improving. Pipelines are stronger than they
were a year ago, certainly stronger they were two quarters ago. And so, while we're not projecting much loan
growth for this year, we do believe that there is and we would expect in 2025, I think, to likely see economic
activity pick up reflected by the increase in activity in our pipelines. So, yes, it's competitive. We think we're
competing effectively, largely because of the quality of the teams that we continue to build and the long-term
relationships that we enjoy. And we'll continue to focus on that.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, David, just a quick one for you. You've done a couple of these incremental
balance sheet repositionings, which would have been great, especially as they've helped to sort of push up the NII
expectation through the year. I think you speak in the deck to opportunities for further ones. Maybe if you could
just sort of help put a frame of reference, would we look at similar sort of iterative ones like this, what would be the
size of the opportunities, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think – so, we continue to look for opportunities like this that it's a good use of capital. We've got our
capital ratio kind of where we need it to be. So to the extent, we can use our capital accretion through earnings for
something like this, it would be good to do and this is about the size. This is probably the biggest you would see
from us. It's in that 10% range of earnings.
So, we like to take opportunities to do this when our payback period is fairly tight. We like three years and in this
one, the first one was 2.1 year payback period. This one was 2.6 years. And so, if we could get an opportunity to
do something in that three and then, we might do that, we may take advantage of that. The curve continues to
steepen. That really gives us an opportunity to take advantage of it as well.

Good morning, Ken.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Question on the deposit side, just I think the plus 3 basis points on the interest -
bearing cost was probably a lot better, a lot lower than people thought. Just wondering if you can kind of talk us
through what you're seeing underneath there in terms of whether you're continuing to see some backfill catch up
or – and whether you're starting to see the ability to kind of change price and how you kind of build that into that
forward expectation? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, our cumulative beta is 43%. We said we'd be in the middle 40%, so call it 43% to 45%. We feel
confident in that because we understand our customer base. They're still with some remixing going on and
because the industry doesn't have a lot of loan growth, the demand or the aggressive competition for deposits just

has not been there. We have to be competitive with our deposit rates and we think we are. We've been very short
on things like CDs to take advantage of when we think rates may actually go the other way.
So, we have a lot of confidence, though, that it may tick up – deposit costs may tick up depending on how the mix
shift happens, continuing to grow core checking accounts and operating accounts, those are really important to
us. And as a result, I don't think you're seeing a major change in our deposit cost and therefore our cumulative
beta in that 45% range, I think, is important.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Okay, cool. Great. And then, just a follow-up on just credit. Great to see the NPAs come down. And also
understanding your point that the two couple credits are fully reserved for, can you just flush out your just general
points on just how asset quality feels, what you're just seeing in underlying migration and any things that you're
still just kind of watching out underneath the surface for the most? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah. So, we've indicated, I guess, for a couple of quarters that we thought our credit metrics would likely
peak in the second quarter. And I think that's proven to be true. We've highlighted a couple of industries that
we've been concerned about now for, again, a couple of quarters that's obviously of our asset classes office,
senior housing, transportation, manufacturing of commercial non-durables, information are areas that we are
following that the particular portfolios where we think there's been some systemic impacts specifically office,
transportation, senior housing, senior housing seems to be improving.
Transportation still in a recession, particularly for those smaller transportation companies that are operating in the
spot market. But that may be improving modestly as well. Office, we're still working through really credit-by-credit.
And we talked about office, we have 101 credits and about 40% of those are – they are single tenant. So we're
really working on about 60 to 70 relationships that are multi-tenant. We think we have a good handle on that
exposure and are continuing to work through it.
With respect to our guidance, our non-performing loans are centered in 20 credits that represent about 72% of our
total non-performing loans. Five of those are office related. And in every case, we're working with the customer. In
some instances, we're adding additional collateral to support the credit. We may be getting some additional tenant
improvement money.
We've got, I think, a pretty good approach to resolving the credits. We know – we believe we are well-reserved.
Just as a point, we've been asked about our allowance. Allowance against our multitenant book is about 9.6%.
Total allowance against our office book, 6.4%. So, we feel like we're adequately reserved against the portfolio and
we just have to continue to work through them. So, our guide is charge-offs toward the upper end of a 40-basis-
point to 50-basis-point range, that reflects the fact that we do have some large exposures. The issue is we can't
predict the timing.
And so, we'll expect these things will get resolved over the next two quarters. They may or they may not, but we
continue to work on it. Otherwise, the level of downgrades and upgrades is sort of coming into equilibrium, which
indicates again that we think we've reached a point of some stabilization in our credit metrics, should potentially
see them go a little higher, go a little lower, they will ebb and flow, but we think we've reached a point of stability.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Following up on Ken's questions on deposits, you're telling us and you've always had a good
view of and know your consumer especially very well. I'm wondering, as we start to take these rate cuts, how we
should expect sort of deposit balances to be hit and then, what the betas could look like? And David, if you could,
sort of, break it down in terms of how you expect the betas in the [indiscernible] (00:25:24) commercial versus
betas for consumer and also to [indiscernible] (00:25:29) could be helpful as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, you broke up a little there, but I think it's kind of what do we think betas will look like as rates come
down. So, we do have a schedule in our investor deck. It's a good one for everybody to look at. It's on page 18.
And so, we really have three buckets of deposits, if you will, with different beta assumptions in all three of these
buckets.
So, in general, we expect a mid-30% down rate beta. And so, if you think about – about 35% of those accounts
reprice with the market. So, they're tied to an index or they are short-term CDs. So, we kept our tenors fairly short,
call it, five months, so that as rates came down, we would have a chance to reprice that. And then, the beta for
those is somewhere between 80% and 100%.
If you go to the other end of the spectrum, we had about 46% of our deposit base that was low beta, low cost,
never moved up, probably not going to move down. And so, that beta is going to be very low because it never
actually increased. And then we have about 19% that's kind of in the middle that we think is, call it, 20% to 30%
beta.
And so, we structured our deposit book to really take advantage of rates as they come down, but we're only
factoring in – even though on uprates, we had 45% beta, as I mentioned earlier, we've only factored in our
guidance to have 30% at a down rate. It could be better than that, but the 30% comes from that math that I just
walked you through, which again is on page 18 of our investor deck.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And it's been a while since we've had sort of – had a level where we stopped at when there has been an
easing cycle that's above zero. And historically, as we – and I'm sure everybody's thinking about this
10


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
[indiscernible] (00:27:35) through 2025 net interest income. Historically, where do you price relative to Fed funds?
Do you price it – if Fed funds ends up being at 3.50%, 3.75% where you're usually 50% of that in terms of where
your deposit costs settle out, is it better? Is it worse? Just trying to think about. Obviously, there's a lot of
uncertainty as to what the ultimate rate path is going to be. But obviously, we need help because, we haven't had
an easing cycle that didn't end at zero for some time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think you got to think of it a little more globally in terms of kind of Fed funds and where do you think
terminal Fed funds are going to be, 2.5% to 3%, that's kind of our best guess. When we get there, who knows?
And in that, with a normal yield curve, where Fed funds are 2.5% to 3%, our balance sheet's structured to have a
margin that's going to be in the 3.75% range, maybe 3.80%. And so, that's our expectation.
We think as rates start to get cut from here and we have a normalizing or less inverted yield curve, that our
margin can pick up. We said we'd exit at 3.50% and we should start to climb as our net interest margin should
start to increase a bit as we go through 2025 and beyond. But the kind of steady state for us would be 3.75% to
3.80%; with the Fed funds, it's 2.5% to 3%.

Good morning. Hey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess maybe, David, just looking at the slide 18 with the historical sort of net charge-offs. Is it fair to conclude
that absent a recession, 50 basis points of charge offs should be set as the high end in the non-recessionary
environment? I understand any given quarter can move around, but generally, is there any reason why charge
offs could be elevated even in a non-recession going forward than what we've seen, I guess, over the last 10
years or 11 years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we don't believe so. Ebrahim, we have had a little change in the composition of our loan portfolio
since the pre-COVID timeframe. We acquired Ascentium Capital, we've acquired EnerBank. We believe we have
11


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
a good handle on what those relative charge offs or the contribution to charge offs will be. But we're observing
that obviously as we operate those companies.
We have grown our presence in the corporate banking space as we've talked about before. We are taking some
larger exposures. That's intentional, helps us as we think about growing our capital markets business being more
important to customers. And so from time-to-time, as you acknowledge, we could have a large charge-off that
would impact the numbers. But generally, we believe, based on all our observations, that the 40-basis-point to 50-
basis-point range is historically appropriate and where we should operate over time.
Certainly non-performing loans somewhere between 80 basis points and 100 basis points is a reasonable range
with may be a little lower. From time to time, I wouldn't expect us, frankly, to be much higher. But that's kind of our
view of what our credit metrics will look like given the composition of the portfolios that we currently have.

That's good color, John. Thank you. And I guess I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks, the pipelines,
lending pipelines are beginning to pick up. Give us a sense like do we need rate cuts for the pipelines to begin to
translate or do we need to get through the elections in order to get things going? Like what would be the driver to
get customers off the sidelines start borrowing? And also give us a sense of, just from a [ph] often (00:31:47)
standpoint, where is the bank hiring. Obviously, there's a lot going on across your markets competitively. Yeah,
where are we investing in terms of branches or hiring of bankers, et cetera, that would be helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, maybe I'll work backwards. We're investing in markets like Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, Dallas, Orlando,
Tampa, where we either have had a significant presence over time and see an opportunity grow or have made
investment like in Houston. And so the first three or four markets, we've been there for some time. We have a
strong presence. We're continuing to build on that. Markets like Houston and Dallas, we're making investments to
grow and see real opportunity there. With respect to your question about pipelines, I think I'm trying to remember
the question now, I see, somebody help me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, what would be the catalyst for like when you talk to speak to your customers, pipelines and
building, is it rate cuts, is it...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry. Yeah. So, I think eliminating uncertainty, but cost is the bigger
issue. I spent some time this week talking to one of our customers who's a large supplier of construction
materials, and he indicated that they're getting a lot of requests for bids. They're completing a lot of bids, but
they're not seeing a lot of work awarded. And I think that's consistent with the fact that costs are still high, whether
it be interest cost, labor costs, cost of materials, and it is costs that make things somewhat uneconomic or create
more risk than customers are comfortable with.
And so I think we need just continue to see adjustments in pricing at the same time, I expect that our customers
will continue to adjust their operations to accommodate changes in pricing. I think that's the bigger factor. The
12

election probably has some impact on just uncertainty overall, as do the broader geopolitical events that are
occurring. But I believe it's probably more likely interest rates and cost will be the catalyst as those things come
down for more economic activity.

question.

John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Morning. Just on the expenses, the guidance is kind of towards the upper end of the range. Is that just because
the fees are coming in higher or anything else in terms of like increased investment spend to top that off as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, the increase is largely attributable to the expected increase in revenue, both from a
net interest income and non-interest revenue standpoint. And we also had $20 million in expenses associated
with the market value adjustments on HR related assets. That was a piece. And to a lesser extent, we've
experienced some modest incremental increases in the first half of the year and opportunities to offset that just
aren't likely. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are committed to generating positive operating leverage in the
second half of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, as you look out a little bit longer term, like I'm not trying to pin you down 2025 but
just call it like the medium term, the next couple of years. Like what do you think is a good underlying expense
growth as we think about some of the positives you mentioned before, like loan growth picking up maybe the
higher capital markets run rate, what would you think is a reasonable level? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A

David J. Turner, Jr. A

Every year, we go through a challenging discussion as to what we think expenses are ought to be for budget and
going forward. If you look, we do have a slide in our investor deck that shows that our compound annual growth
13

rate since about 2016 is little over 3%. We try to keep it to 2.5% if we can. We've had some labor inflation, as
everybody has over the last couple of years, and obviously technology costs continue to go up. So I would expect
us to be somewhere, Matt, in that 2.5% to 3% range and not committing to that just yet. We'll give you the
guidance for 2025 in January, but that should give you at least a start.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. So, this is just a follow-up, I think, to Ebrahim's question. So, you've had a good – you're on pace
to have a good mid-single digit or 7% growth I think, in core fees this year. What do you think Regions can
achieve over the next two years to three years with all the tactical hires you've kind of made and when they just
start monetizing? And if fees are about 33% of revenues, what do you think that could be in three years to five
years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we continue to look for ways to generate fees by offering products and services that our customers value
and need. And so, you've seen us do several acquisitions to that end. We're trying to stay committed to
generating positive operating leverage between growth and NII and NIR and controlling our expense base.
So, I think, we'll continue to do that and expect to generate positive operating leverage in 2025. We'll give you a
finer point on that again in January. But, if we could have a little higher percentage of our fees, we've always said
we would like to have revenue 50/50 between NII and NIR. We've been saying that for long time and been able to
get there. But if we're going to increase that call it 40% of our revenue in fees, that'll be great.
We've overcome an awful lot of consumer fee declines, whether it be interchange through Durbin, OD fees and
the like. And we've made investments in other products and services that have helped us, including Treasury
Management investments that we've made where we've been up, call it, 7% to 10%, three years running now. So
Wealth Management continues to grow. They had a great quarter. This quarter hit a record, as a matter of fact.
14

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
So, we're going to continue to look for ways to generate fee growth that offset some – we have some potential
impacts if Durbin gets updated, we've given you that information. So, I think it's incumbent upon us to continue to
look for ways to continue to grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then regarding capital on slide 10. Just, do you have any kind of target or – aspirational target that you have
for CET1 all-in if it's 8.2% at quarter end?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we have a capital range of operating range of 9.25% to 9.75% on CET1. We've increased that to 10
point this quarter, 10.4%. The reason for that was partly uncertainty with the economy and then uncertainty with
regards to Basel III and what that was going to mean to us. We have seen the draft of B3, as has everybody, and
we think we're within striking distance of whatever the ultimate Basel III is going to be. And so we don't need to let
our capital continue to accrete higher from here and as a result, if we generate income, we'll continue to pay a fair
dividend.
We'll continue to look for ways to reposition our securities portfolio. If that makes sense and if all else doesn't
work, then we'll buy our stock back. And we've done all three of those things this past. And of course, we use that
to grow loans as well. And you should look for us to continue that. And so the capital of CET1 of 10.3%, 10.4% is
about where you should expect it to be going forward. That's until we ultimately get Basel III.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. But so that implies, you were kind of – there was a decline in your buybacks in the second quarter. So, we
should expect a meaningful increase in the third and fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, commensurate with earnings and if we – the reason that we had changed, we used a bit of that capital for
the $50 million pre-tax loss we took on the securities repositioning. So, it's all predicated on how big, if any, of our
capital generation will we use for that. The buyback is nothing more than what it takes to solve for getting us to
10.3%, 10.4% common equity Tier 1.

Hi, John. Hi, David.

Hi, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
John, you and I have talked in the past about pipelines and you emphasized that they are stronger today than
they have been recently. And I know it's hard to quantify this, but can you give us any kind of subjective opinion
that, these pipelines, the pull through could be even better than in the past or any color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I don't have an opinion, Gerard, that would be different than our historical experience. I do think that we are
seeing, as I said, pipelines build. We have seen some softness in some of our specialized businesses and those
pipelines, in particular, are beginning to improve, particularly, in areas like energy as an example, financial
services where we also include our subscription lines in our – that would be comprised of our insurance book, of
some of the businesses where we're lending to customers who actually lend to others. We've got some strong
relationships in consumer finance that have been really good over time. But I can't tell you that I believe
necessarily that we're going to see any change in pull through rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And I know, David, you've given us very good detail on the CET1 and uses of capital for buybacks or
the securities repositioning, possibly John or David or both of you. Can you give us your views on acquisitions? I
know, you, over the recent past, have done non-depository acquisitions, of course. But when you look out over
the next two or three years, there's likely to be more banking consolidation. How do you kind of look at that
outlook for Regions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Gerard, thank you. We have said historically that we've not been interested in depository acquisition. We've
obviously made a number of non-bank acquisitions that have added to our capabilities, helped us grow and
diversify revenue. And we continue to look for those. We believe that we have a really solid plan. If we execute
our plan, then we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders without doing any bank M&A. It's
disruptive, it's challenging.
We certainly have, over time, through our performance, improved our positioning. Our currency is much stronger
than it was 6, 7 years, 10 years ago. But we still don't think that bank acquisition necessarily is in our future. It's
not part of our strategy today. As I said, it's disruptive, it's complicated. And frankly, if we just execute our plan, we
think we can deliver great results for our shareholders. That's not to say we won't follow what's going on. We'll pay
attention and we will continue to observe the market. But today, we're focused on executing our plans.

John Pancari Q

Good morning.

John M. Turner, Jr. A

Hey, John.

David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Back to credit. Your ACL ratio came down slightly this quarter by about a bit. And just given what you're seeing on
the credit front, given your commentary that your trends are peaking around this quarter on certain fronts, where
do you see the reserve ratio going from here? Can you kind of walk through the expectations if you could see
incremental release on that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, John. So, as we stated, if you look at our credit metrics, they're improving. We've said our charge-offs
would be at the upper end of our range. And so, those are our reserve for, so the expectation would be, absent
loan growth or changes in economic conditions as those charge-offs come through, you would expect the ACL to
come down. Where it comes down ultimately, which is what I think your question is, is hard to tell.
We have to look at it every quarter and take all the information that's available to come up with the reserve.
Something that you can look at, just as a guide, is if you were to go to pre-pandemic or pre-CECL, which was the
fourth quarter of 2019, and in that scenario, credit was kind of looking pretty good, but there was a little bit of a
forecast, a downturn in economy at that time. And our absolute CECL reserve was 1.71%. If you take the losses,
though, at that time by portfolio and apply it to our current portfolio, that would equate to a reserve level of 1.61%.
I think we put that on the bottom of one of our charts.
And so, you would expect over time to bleed back down towards something more normal like that. How fast that
gets there, when it can get there, that's impossible for us to tell. But, generally speaking, what we know today is
that if we have charge-offs coming through in the short term, you should see the ACL come down.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
Yeah. Thank you for that. I know you expected it flat to down, but just helping frame it like that is, it's definitely
helpful. And then, secondly, on the expense front, as a follow-up to Matt's question, I know you're confident in the
positive operating leverage in the back half of this year. And it sounds like you're focusing on positive operating
leverage for next year as well. Your long-term expense growth rate that you alluded to in your response of 2.5%
to 3%, that's a bit above where it looks like consensus is running right now, around 2% for next year. I guess,
where are you investing in areas that could put you in that 2.5% to 3% range versus anywhere lower and maybe if
you could talk about what that would mean for a longer term efficiency ratio that you should be running at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we're going to give you more pointed guidance for 2025 later. So, we're not trying to get ahead of
ourselves. Generally speaking, inflation that's baked into our book is going to be close to that 2.5%, our largest
category of expense for salaries and benefits. And so, we have to adequately pay our people. And we are also
investing in technology, cyber, consumer compliance, all those things take a lot of money to continue to invest in
them, to improve in all those areas.
We have to find ways to pay for that. And that's what gets harder as we – the low-hanging fruit is not there. We've
done a really good job of controlling our expense base. We have one of the lowest efficiency ratios in the peer
group. We were hoping to get to the lower 50s over time we think we can do that. But we're going to have to
leverage technology better overtime than we do today. And I think that's going to be true for anybody in the
industry. And so, by doing that, you have less reliance on labor. And so, you can let natural attrition take care of
labor as you implement technology solutions.
So, we're spending call it 9% to 11% of our revenue on technology. We have some big technology projects in the
works with our new deposit system, new commercial loan system, new general ledger. Those take money. We
got to figure out how to pay for that and keep our expense run rate as low as we can. So, our goal is to try to
continue to move our efficiency ratio down from where we are today to get to that lower 50s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. No. That's helpful. And since you mentioned the deposit system, is that still running on plan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
It's a big project and it's moving according to how we have it laid out. But we've got a long way to go, so we're not
there yet.

Hey, good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just want to make sure I heard you right on the NIM, normalized NIM in normalized rate environment. So, if I
heard you correctly, it was normalized rate environment starts with the Fed funds. That's somewhat similar to
inflation, right, like 2.5%, 3%. And you have a steep curve from there or a steep normal curve, not inverted. And in
that environment, on a full-year basis, you're saying that your normalized NIM should be somewhere in the 3.75%
to 3.80% range, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
That's right. You got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And that based on the forward curve that would be, again, sometime in 2025 or 2026?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, obviously, that's higher than your NIM that you had this quarter. Could you just walk? And I know
you spend a lot of time on the NII and the NIM in the beginning part of the call, I just want to make sure I
understand the key drivers that take you from where your NIM is today to that normalized? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think as rates continue to come down, our funding cost, our input costs will come down as well. And
the power of our front book, back book will continue to benefit us for a couple of years. So, with the curve
19


Regions Financial Corp.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2024
steepening and a repricing of the balance sheet, that's what drives you up from where you are in the 3.50% to that
3.75% range that we just talked about. It's just about what period of time we think we have our beta down coming
– down rate beta in the mid-30s we think is appropriate, perhaps conservative.
And so, it's an important driver to get the input cost down and to continue to grow balance sheet, to grow, we
have some high yielding assets that have higher losses, but they have nice returns, nice net interest margins
continuing to grow checking accounts of a consumer and operating accounts of a business are huge drivers to
lowering the input cost on deposits. And so, that's why it's so important for us to continue to make investments in
the markets. As John mentioned earlier, for both of those reasons and the consumer side and business side to
get those checking accounts and operating accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So, should I – do I read it as you are liability sensitive or do I read it as you are neutral with these changes
that drive the NIM higher or you're asset sensitive but decliningly so as rates fall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
We're neutral to the short rates. And so to the extent we start seeing rate cuts, then you're going to see our
deposit costs continuing to come down. And we still have fixed rate assets that will continue to help benefit NII
and the margin and will happen as the curve will steepen. So you keep if you stay anchored on the long end and
short rate comes down and we'll benefit from that as well.
