Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Andy Harmening and I'm
joined this afternoon by our Chief Financial Officer, Derek Meyer; and our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern. I'll kick
things off by sharing some highlights from the quarter. From there, Derek will provide a few updates on our
margin, our income statement and capital trends, and Pat will cover up on an update on the credit.
Now, as we entered 2024, we've had two key themes in mind. First, the resilience of our local markets in the face
of macro uncertainty. And then our continuing to drive our strategic plans by acquiring customers, deepening
relationships, and enhancing our return profile. While recent economic data has clouded the macro outlook over
the remainder of the year, we're encouraged by the resilience we've seen in our Midwestern footprint, where
unemployment levels in Wisconsin and Minnesota remain at or below 3%. The consumer remains relatively
healthy, despite rising prices. And our commercial customers continue to explore investments in their businesses,
while remaining vigilant about the challenges posed by the current environment.
Also giving us confidence is our disciplined approach to credit. We've anchored ourselves in stable Midwestern
markets, and we developed a diversified CRE portfolio with limited exposure to key pressure points such as rent
controlled multifamily or downtown office properties. Given the pressures from elevated rates, we have continued
to see signs of normalization in the portfolio, but has been on a case-by-case basis. We have yet to see any
meaningful negative trends concerning specific asset classes or geographies.
With that said, our team has remained disciplined, methodically reviewing our portfolios on a regular basis to
ensure we're rating appropriately and staying ahead of any issues that may emerge down the road. All of these
factors have enabled our company remain front footed on executing our strategic plan. Since I joined the
company three years ago, we've generated significant momentum. We bolstered our leadership team with several
key hires across the bank. We've continued to add talented commercial RMs throughout the footprint, and we
have significantly elevated the customer experience for our retail and small business customers by deploying
several product upgrades and modernizing our customer-facing digital experiences. These efforts are driving
results across the company. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to improve to historically high
levels. And earlier this month, we were recognized by J.D. Power, who named us Number One for Retail Banking
Satisfaction in the Upper Midwest. Our colleague engagement scores have also improved as we advanced our
plan. We were recently named a winner of the 2024 Top Workplaces in the USA Award, while also winning five
Energage Awards for Cultural Excellence. We believe the foundation of a successful company starts with happy
customers and happy colleagues and we can see evidence that we're on the right track. Importantly, though, our
efforts have also translated to results that have direct impact on our bottom line.
Here in Q1, we saw positive household growth across the bank after several years of downward trends in organic
numbers, and we again delivered broad-based loan growth and core customer deposit growth for the quarter,
both of which enable us to remix our balance sheet and improve our return profile over time.
To build on this organic growth momentum, we're hard at work executing Phase 2 of our strategic plan, originally
announced in November, with several key hires, product launches and other initiatives already completed in the
past 180 days, we remain on track with our plans. We expect the full impact of these actions in Phase 2 to be
realized in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. As we look forward, we're encouraged by the early results from
our plan, but we expect to make additional progress as we move throughout the year. While macro question
marks remain, we feel well-positioned due to our foundation discipline around credit and expenses. Tailwinds
from growth initiatives already completed, and incremental momentum from Phase 2. We're on track towards
providing a stronger future for our company and importantly, our key stakeholder group as well.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
With that, I'd like to walk through some of the financial highlights for the first quarter beginning on slide 2. On a
diluted GAAP basis, we posted earnings of $0.52 per share here in Q1, demonstrating the underlying strength of
our core earnings profile in what has been a challenging operating environment for the industry. We continue to
remix both sides of the balance sheet by executing on initiatives that help us lower our funding costs, improve our
liquidity position, while also improving earned – earning asset yields.
On the funding side, we're focused on driving core customer deposit growth. And here in Q1, we accomplished
that by adding customer deposits for the third consecutive quarter. Specifically, core customer deposits grew by
2% during the first quarter. These results were boosted somewhat seasonally, but the growth was also a
reflection of the momentum we've generated through our organic growth strategy. Across the bank, we've now
added $1.4 billion of core customer deposits since the midpoint of 2023. This emphasis on core customer funding
sources has also enabled us to draw down on our wholesale funding by another 5% during Q1.
During the quarter, we also grew period end loans by $278 million, led by steady growth in our prime/super prime
auto portfolio and emerging C&I growth. We continue to build high quality balances in these segments to diversify
and strengthen our earning asset mix over time. And we're encouraged by these initial results in what is typically a
seasonally slow loan growth quarter.
Moving to the income statement, improving asset yields were boosted by the full benefit of our Q4 repositioning to
drive a 2% increase in net interest income and a 10 basis point increase in our margin for the quarter. Deposit
cost pressures have not yet fully subsided as of Q1, but the pressures continue to abate as the mix shift in our
back book has slowed and the competitive environment has stabilized. Our noninterest income of $65 million was
up $3 million from the same period last year. And while we feel confident about the stability of our non-interest
income in the short term and about our ability to grow this category down the road, we continue to expect non-
interest income to compress slightly in 2024. And while we continue to invest in people, products, process and
technology, expense discipline remains a foundational focus for our company. Our Q1 noninterest expense of
$198 million included another $8 million in FDIC special assessment costs to replenish the deposit insurance
fund. We will continue to diligently manage our run rate expense level as we execute our growth strategy
throughout the year. Our conservative credit culture also continues to be a foundational component of our
strategy.
In Q1, we did see our non-accruals and net charge-offs tick higher, but these trends were balanced by decreases
in delinquencies and total criticized loans. Taking a disciplined and consistent approach to reviewing loan risk
rating provides a good view of the credit risk in our portfolio by both segment and geography. We will continue to
monitor asset quality closely so we can stay ahead of the curve.
Now, we've generated significant momentum as a company over the past three years, and as shown on slide 3,
the benefits of these efforts are starting to come through in a number of ways. Since announcing our initial
strategic plan back in 2021, we've added key talent in leadership positions across the bank. We've grown our
commercial RM base. We've upgraded the customer experience, implemented a successful massive loan
program, and amplified our brand presence throughout our footprint. In each case, this progress started with
listening, listening to our colleagues, listening to our customers. And by delivering what these stakeholder groups
have asked for, our efforts are being recognized.
We've used customer feedback to steadily improve the bank experience through digital upgrades, product
launches and service enhancements. These efforts were recognized earlier this month when we were named
Number One for Retail Banking Customer Satisfaction in the Upper Midwest by J.D. Power. We've also used

colleague feedback to enhance collaboration and provide them with the tools they need to do their jobs better.
Just this week, we were named winner of the 2024 for Top Workplaces USA Award and also won five Culture
Excellence Awards.
Importantly, though, our efforts aren't just winning awards. They're transforming our financial profile. Here in Q1,
we saw net growth across the board in consumer business wealth households reversing a steady trend of net
decreases over the past several years. As compared to the same period a year ago, our consumer household
acquisition was up 26%. Our consumer household attrition rate was down 9% over the same time. Customer
growth with quality accounts will provide a tailwind financially over time.
We're also seeing our strategy translate to net growth on both sides of the balance sheet in what has been a
challenging growth environment for the industry. During Q1, we again saw broad-based loan growth and core
customer deposit growth. These are just a few examples of how the work that has been done across the company
is setting us up to become a stronger company over time.
As we move to slide 4, we want to share a few more recent examples of how we're building on our momentum.
Since announcing Phase 2 of our organic growth strategy back in November, we've stayed on offense, achieving
several milestones in our second wave of organic [ph] investments (11:59). In some cases, these efforts are
already having an impact, but we expect to see the full impact ramp up over the course of the year and into 2025.
Now, I've said before, we're not looking to just fill seats at Associated. We're looking to add talent. The success of
any strategy hinges on having the right people in the right places. And we've made significant strides in bolstering
our senior leadership team with top talent from across the Midwest. We expect that trend to continue when we
add Mike Lebens to our commercial team in Minnesota next month. Mike joins us from Wells Fargo where we
spent over 20 years in commercial banking, most recently serving as a division portfolio executive for six states,
including Wisconsin and Minnesota.
We also need to ensure we have the right folks on the front line to help us drive towards our goals. As such, we're
continuing to invest in training for our branch bankers to handle mass affluent relationships. We're continuing to
add commercial and small business RMs throughout the footprint. And just last week, we enhanced our
commercial banking team by adding three senior RMs in Madison, Milwaukie, and Chicago. There is a growing
perception in the Midwest that Associated Banc is an employer of choice, and that's both internally and externally.
On the right side of the page, we've continued to make progress with various digital product and marketing
enhancements designed to support organic growth. Taken with the enhancements we've already made, these
actions bolster our efforts to attract new customers and deliver – and deepen relationships. As the impact of each
of these initiatives ramps up over the course of the year, we expect them to have an increasing impact on our
financial results. This gives us confidence that we are on track with our strategic plan. And as such, we continue
to expect total loan growth of between 4% and 6%. Total core customer deposit growth of between 3% and 5%,
and total net interest income growth of between 2% and 4% for 2024.
So, with that, I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the first quarter beginning on slide 5. As
mentioned, we added $557 million of core customer deposit growth in Q1, representing a 2% increase from the
prior quarter. While these results were boosted by seasonality, the growth was broad based across several
subcategories, reflecting stabilization of the mix shift we've experienced over the past year. Over the past three
quarters, we've now added $1.4 billion in core customer deposits to our balance sheet. This core growth has
enabled us to steadily decrease our reliance on wholesale funding sources, and we brought down our total
wholesale funding by another 5% here in Q1. Deposit flows continue to be lumpy by nature and the environment
remains competitive. But we remain confident in our growth prospects based on incremental boost we expect to

receive from our initiatives over the course of the year. And as such, we continue to expect to drive core customer
deposit growth between 3% and 5% for 2024.
Moving to slide 6, we highlight our loan trends through the first quarter. On a quarterly average basis, loan
balances decreased by $583 million in Q1, which is a direct reflection of the $969 million mortgage loan sale that
settled towards the end of December. On a period end basis, however, loans grew by $278 million in Q1. As
expected, the overall loan growth trends were led by steady growth in our prime/super prime auto book and the
commercial and industrial bucket. We've continued to emphasize these areas as a way to help us remix our
balance sheet over time to decrease our reliance on low yielding, lower relationship asset classes, and to
enhance our return profile while still maintaining our solid credit standards. Across our broader portfolio, we
continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes full banking relationships, quality credit profiles, and
diversification to deliver improved returns. Taking into account the current lending environment and the
anticipated impacts of our initiatives, we continue to expect to drive total loan growth of 4% to 6% in 2024.
With that, I'll pass it to Derek to walk through the income statement and capital churns. Derek?

Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our asset and liability yield trends on slide 7. While the target Fed funds rate has
remained stable since July of last year, we continue to see asset yields inch higher through the back half of 2023.
And that trend has continued into Q1 of this year as a sizable portion of our loan book is repriced and remixed
over time. This trend has been led primarily by the C&I, CRE and auto categories. Total earning asset yields
increased by 13 basis points over the prior quarter and landed at 5.64% here in Q1. Like others in the industry,
we've seen our funding costs increase over the past year due to a combination of rising rates, liquidity pressures,
and a mix shift in our customer deposit base. However, after seeing these pressures stabilize over the back half
of 2023, the rate on total interest bearing liabilities flattened out at 3.55% from the fourth quarter to the first
quarter. This flattening was largely driven by the paydown of FHLB that we completed as part of our balance
sheet repositioning in Q4. But it's also a function of ongoing stabilization in the deposit environment and our
efforts to strengthen our funding profile through organic core customer growth – deposit growth.
Moving to slide 8, you can clearly see the impact of these recent trends on both our net interest income and our
margin. Here in Q1, our NII landed at $258 million for the quarter, a $4 million increase from the prior quarter. Our
NIM increased by 10 basis points to 2.79%.
As we shift to slide 9, I want to take a moment to discuss all the various elements of our strategic plan, our shift in
the mix on both sides of our balance sheet, and driving us towards an enhanced profitability profile. On the asset
side of the balance sheet, we've already taken several steps to diversify our loan mix in a way that enables us to
decrease our reliance on low-yielding, low-relationship lending strategy while still maintaining our solid credit
standards. We meaningfully grown our commercial RM base over the past three years, while also changing the
incentive structure to emphasize holistic relationships, including deposits and other services. We've steadily
grown a prime/super prime indirect auto portfolio to diversify our consumer lending business at higher spreads.
And last year, we exited the low-relationship, low-yielding TPO mortgage business, sold nearly $1 billion in
mortgage loans and moved to an originate to sell model.
During the first quarter, you could see the results of these changes in our loan growth figures, where we added
$215 million in auto balances to a portfolio with average yield of over 5.5%, added $127 million in C&I balances to
a commercial business portfolio with an average yield of over 7%, and held balances flat on a mortgage book with
an average yield of below 3.5%.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
On the liability side, we've talked extensively about our efforts to attract, deepen and retain core customer
relationships as a way to decrease our reliance on wholesale funding. And you've seen that come to life as we've
added significant core customer deposit balances for three straight quarters, while taking steps to decrease our
wholesale funding over the same time period.
So as you can see, all of this has not happened by accident. We're taking purposeful actions that are changing
the makeup of our balance sheet and the return profile of our company for the better. The early results are
promising, but we're still working to make sure we stay on track to meet our medium-term goals. Based on our
current expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed action, we continue to expect net interest
income growth of between 2% to 4% in 2024. This guidance assumes 325 basis point Fed rate cuts throughout
the year beginning in June.
On slide 10, we continue to manage our securities book to remain within our 18% to 20% target with the benefit of
rising rates and our securities repositioning, the average yield on our securities book has now risen by 67 basis
points from the same period a year ago. After adjusting our CET1 capital ratio to include the impacts of AOCI.
This impact would have represented a 64 basis point hit to CET1 in Q1. The spread of this impact grew slightly
versus the prior quarter, largely driven by rising interest rates. As a percent of total assets, our investment
securities and cash position held firmly at roughly 21% at the end of the quarter. Over the remainder of 2024, we
will continue to target investments to total assets of between 18% and 20%.
Moving to slide 11, we highlight our noninterest income trends through Q1. Our noninterest income came in at
$65 million for the quarter, which was down $5 million relative to our adjusted Q4 number, but was up $3 million
from the same period a year ago. Our first quarter results were driven by a $2 million increase in service charges
and deposit account fees and a $1 million increase in mortgage banking. After posting the $6 million gain on sale
of B2B shares in Q4, we also booked another $4 million gain on the sale of B2B in Q1. As of March 31, we had no
vis-a-vis shares remaining. These figures were partially offset by $5 million decrease in capital markets fees,
which stemmed from quarterly decreases in syndications and trading account revenues. While we feel well-
positioned on the durability of our non-interest income in a challenged environment, we continue to expect non-
interest income to compress by [ph] 0% to 2% (21:51) as compared to our adjusted 2023 base of $264 million.
Moving on to slide 12. We continue to make targeted investments to support our initiatives, but maintaining a
disciplined on expenses continues to be a foundational focus for the company. Our first quarter expenses of $198
million were up 5% relative to Q1 of 2023, but were down 17% from the GAAP number we reported in the fourth
quarter of 2023. After booking $31 million for the FDIC special assessment in Q4, we booked an additional $8
million in FDIC special assessment expense in Q1. This was partially offset by $3 million refund in other FDIC
assessment costs.
On an adjusted basis, our efficiency ratio landed at 57.2% for the quarter, which is the lowest we've seen since
Q2 of 2023. Our noninterest expense to average assets ratio also fell back below 2% for the quarter, which
demonstrates our ability to keep expenses in check while investing in our growth strategy.
With that in mind, we continue to expect total noninterest expense growth of between 2% and 3% for 2024 off of
our adjusted 2023 base of $783 million. These figures exclude the FDIC special assessment expense in Q4 and
Q1. We also continue to expect annual operating leverage of between negative 1% and 0% in 2024.
Shifting to slide 13, we saw a 3 basis point net decrease in our TCE ratio during the quarter, finishing at 7.08%.
This net decrease was driven by a 9 basis point hit from AOCI due to higher long-term rates. After following the

9.39% as a result of our balance sheet repositioning in Q4, our CET1 rebounded in Q1, ending the quarter at
9.43%. Both our TCE and CET1 remain well within our 2024 target ranges as of Q1. Given current market
conditions and the expectation for short-term rates to remain elevated in the near term, we expect TCE to remain
in the range of 6.75% to 7.75% in 2024. We also expect CET1 to remain in the range of 8% to – I'm sorry, 9% to
10% for the same timeframe.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit quality.

Patrick E. Ahern
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start our credit portion with an allowance update on slide 14. We utilized the Moody's
February 2024 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast
remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the higher interest rate environment. The baseline forecast
contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive GDP growth rates, a cooling labor market and continued
deceleration of inflation. Our ACLL increased by $2 million during the quarter to $388 million, with increases in the
commercial, CRE Investor, and other consumer categories partially offset by decreases in CRE construction and
raising mortgage.
Our allowance continues to be driven by loan growth in select areas such as auto, nominal credit movement and
general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our Midwest footprint. As such, our reserves to loan ratio
landed at 1.31% in Q1, a 1 basis point decrease versus the prior quarter, but a 6 basis point increase from the
same period a year ago.
Moving to slide 15, our portfolio has continued to hold up relatively well with limited migration through the pipeline,
as evidenced by our core credit quality trends. At the top of the funnel, our delinquencies came down
meaningfully in both the 30 to 89 day and the 90-plus day buckets during the first quarter. As we look further
down the line at our total criticized and classified loans, the substandard accruing and non-accrual buckets ticked
higher. But these increases were more than offset by $61 million decrease in the special mention category.
Netting the difference, total criticized loans actually decreased slightly for the second straight quarter. We remain
encouraged with the stability of total criticized assets and the decrease in these credits showing early stress.
Within the non-accrual bucket, we continue to see puts and takes in Q1 consistent with our normal course of
business. This includes one new $25 million credit in which recent and pending improvements may provide a path
forward for a quick resolution. Outside of that one particular credit, non-accruals would have remained relatively
stable for the quarter, which we see as another sign of overall credit stability.
Finally, we booked $22 million in net charge-offs during the quarter and at $24 million in provision. While net
charge-offs rose from the prior quarter, they in part reflect an opportunity the bank had to accelerate a credit
resolution earlier than expected. The overall net charge-off rate still remains within the 2024 expectations.
Taken together, this picture gives us confidence that the increase we saw in non-accrual loans and net charge-
offs during Q1 represent a handful of credits migrating through our ratings system and not necessarily a sign of
broader issues coming down the road in future quarters. Overall, we remain comfortable in the normalized
[indiscernible] (27:32) activity we've seen across the bank.
As we've done over the past 12 months to 24 months, our ongoing quarterly portfolio deep dives and risk rating
analysis remain a focus and a key tool to stay ahead of credit concerns, given the uncertain macro outlook noted

earlier. As we look into the year, we remain diligent on monitoring credit stressors in the macro economy to
ensure current underwriting reflects ongoing inflation pressures, labor cost to just name a few economic concerns.
In addition, we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio,
including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bank wide. Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments
to continue to reflect changes to risk grades, economic condition, loan volumes and other indications of credit
quality.
Finally, we've provided a refresh of [indiscernible] (28:32) CRE metrics on slide 16. As a reminder, our
conservative approach to credit has been optimized over course of the past several years as we've built a diverse
portfolio of high-quality commercial loans across our portfolios and a focus on prime and super prime consumer
portfolios. While CRE continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry, we feel well-positioned given the
conservative approach we've applied across the bank.
In building our CRE portfolio, we've focused on partnering with well-known developers and build a portfolio
predominantly in stable Midwest markets. Over two-thirds of our CRE portfolio is based in the Midwest with an
emphasis on multi-family and industrial properties. We do not have any exposure to the rent controlled New York
City real estate market. Office loans represent just 3% of our total loans as a bank. Within that portfolio, we are
weighted towards Class A properties in non-urban environments. We continue to take a proactive approach to
CRE office credits with the majority of those loans maturing for the remainder of 2024, already having strategies
in place whether that be refinance, sale or qualifying for extension at prevailing underwriting standards. While we
feel well-positioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in, we continue to monitor this
and all of our portfolios closely.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Thank you. I'd like to wrap up by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide 17. First, our
strategy emphasizes quality, relationship focused loan growth that decreases our reliance on lower yielding, non-
relationship balances and enhances our profitability profile. Based on recent progress against our plan,
incremental momentum, we expect over the remainder of the year and the current macro outlook, we continue to
expect total loan growth of between 4% and 6% in 2024. On the other side of the balance, we've been pleased
with the momentum we've seen from three straight quarters of core customer deposit growth. This gives us
confidence we're on the right track with our initiatives and we expect to benefit further over the next several
quarters as our Phase 2 initiatives start to have a full impact. As such, we continue to expect core customer
deposit growth of 3% to 5% in 2024.
On the income statement, we've adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and
rate environment. Our latest forecast assumes three Fed rate cuts beginning in June. Taking these factors into
account, we continue to expect net interest income growth of between 2% and 4% in 2024. And lastly, our
disciplined approach to expense, expenses remains a foundational focus our company. With this in mind, we
continue to expect noninterest expense growth of 2% to 3% in 2024 after excluding the impact from the FDIC
special assessment expense in Q4 and Q1.
With that, we'll open it up for questions.

Maybe first starting on the margin guidance. So, you reiterated the guidance from prior quarter, but you removed
three rate cut assumptions. And now it seems more likely that we get the later two cuts than the June cut. So
should we think about that ranges as more toward the upper end or was there more pressure than anticipated the
first quarter that we should still be thinking kind of middle and then, how does the lack of June cut play into the
guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I'll start that and let – this is Andy. I'll let – I'll have Derek finish that. I think you should be thinking squarely
in the range of what we had before. I wouldn't go low and I wouldn't go high. And the reason I say that is because
the – assuming that it's higher for longer, you have an impact on your funding costs, whether that be CD renewals
or wholesale funding. However, we're slightly asset sensitive, so we have a benefit there. When I look at three
rate cuts or six or one rate cut and as you get towards the second half of the year, I just see it being less and less
material to us. I think it's fairly neutral between three and one rate cuts. So as we look at it today, we'll have to see
how the deposit environment progresses with pricing. But we're assuming that it will be a little bit more expensive,
but we think that still lands us squarely in the range and the forecast that we had before. And then remembering
on the asset side, we're generating assets at a little bit higher yield. And we had a decent loan growth in the fourth
– first quarter. And we continue to expect that we're going to be in the range on loan growth for the rest of the
year and those loans bringing a higher yield with them. Derek.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think, we expect NIM to widen by the end of the year and we expect sequentially NII to go up. I think the
behavior of the deposits is really the key. I don't think anyone's been terribly confident that that's completely
settled down. So I think we feel really good about the quarter. We felt good about last quarter on the deposit
performance. I just don't think we want to get ahead of ourselves.

Okay. I appreciate that. The other thing is kind of a similar question, but, we've seen nice progress. You've seen
nice progress on the deposit base had pretty good growth in the non-interest bearing in the quarter. Maybe you
could talk about where that was coming from and if you have an idea in budgeting or as you think through this of
what is a new normalized range either through the cycle or when we get to kind of a more normalized time period
for what the non-interest bearing would be as a percentage of the of the deposit base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So last time – I think last quarter, we shared that we expected non-interest-bearing deposits to floor out at about
$5.8 billion, $5.9 billion. And that's still what we think. This came in as expected. We have a lot of seasonality, the
first part of the year which makes that number move around quite a bit. It came in – because it came in as
expected. We feel good about it and expect it to creep up closer to $6 billion by the end of the year. So our
expectation is that it doesn't in nominal dollars doesn't decrease, and our most of our focus is then growing on
interest bearing deposits and trying to make sure that we optimize that, so that we can keep a lid on the amount
of wholesale funding we use. And that's really driving the puts and takes on our margin going forward.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Hey, just kind of a follow-up on slide 5, you guys had good savings and money market growth. Can you talk a little
bit about what drove that and do you feel like that's a repeatable type trend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Maybe I'll take that one, Derek. It's when I look at what our forecast is for the year, because there's
seasonality that's always involved. But when we look at the full year, we expect the vast majority of what we're
going to get in deposit growth to come from consumer. So you start with the fact we're growing households, but
we're growing households and getting a higher average deposit amount per household. That's a really nice
combination.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Secondly, on mass affluent, we've gotten hundreds of millions dollars in additional funds from this customer
segment. That segment makes up 75% typically of the base of the consumer company, consumer bank. We've
been doing that for a year-and-a-half and we're expanding the number of people that are considered mass
affluent experts.
Third, our Private Wealth team has accelerated its growth in two ways. One, to have a good private wealth
deposit base, you have to have a good mass affluent base. Now, those customers are starting to expand up into
Private Wealth. Secondly, under the leadership of our new Head of Private Wealth, President of Private Wealth,
Jayne Hladio, the group and the referrals internally within the different segments of Private Wealth in some cases
have doubled. So we are seeing very strong growth from the Private Wealth side.
The question of can we continue? If we could continue at that rate, we'd be forecasting 8% growth. We're
forecasting 3% to 5%. And the simple reason on that is we knew the first half would be somewhat lumpy. You
have bonus time and then you have tax receipts. The tax receipts largely happen disbursement in the second
quarter. So we thought we'd be fairly flat in the second quarter. And then we saw last year that trend of increase
in the second half of the year. We're going to enter the second half of the year with more momentum from our
foundational products, services, digital, commercial than we had last year, and a little bit less noise in the
marketplace. So that's why we come in at that 3% to 5%. But do we think it's sustainable that we outperform the
market over an extended period of time and deposit growth? Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

It is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. That's good. Okay. Then on slide 7, Derek, you said something in your comments and I think I missed it.
But can you talk about the rate on new auto paper that you're getting and what kind of growth expectations you
have for auto?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We still think it's – we haven't talked a lot about the rates, but generally for the last quarter and last several
quarters, it's north of 7%, and we expect to see roughly the same nominal dollar amount of growth each quarter.
It's been a little north of $200 million. And that will continue, it'll – the dollar amount will slightly decrease as the
portfolio grows and the run-off grows. But we're not – we expanded into our footprint states and we don't have
plans to add other markets beyond that for the year or in our guidance that was contemplated for now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. So that – but that yield should march higher over time.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Question on fee income, if I back out the [indiscernible] (41:02) gain in the first
quarter, is the core run rate a bit lower? And I know you talked about capital markets and what happened in the
first quarter. Do you expect that business to rebound in Q2 through the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We do. It was low last year, first quarter also. So you expect – I think you've got it right, actually.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then the run rate, is it a bit lower or am I just looking at one quarter and the full year, you're still
confident in that range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We're still confident in that range. I do not expect it to be lower than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the used to be specialized lending on slide 6,
I think you removed it a quarter or two ago, maybe just talk about the progress there and was it asset based
equipment finance? And is that just folded into commercial and business lending now?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2024
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It really is folded into commercial lending now. I mean, really, when you get into it, it's the same segment
serving a similar customer, particularly with equipment finance. Those continue to be really good businesses for
us. I mean, if we broke that out, we're right on the plan that we envisioned when we launch those. So we thought
it was just a cleaner view just to look at that as a full view of commercial. But no question being able to provide
equipment finance in the manufacturing belt was wise and our asset-based lending team is just strong. They do
this the right way and they do in a very buttoned up fashion and they've had nice progression on the growth in that
space as well.

question.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, everybody. Derek, I was hoping that you could speak to the expected expense trajectory. I know
you had said previously that cost would come down in the first quarter, but nevertheless, this quarter's core
number looks quite a bit better than I would have figured. So I guess there'll be some reversion back upward.
Presumably I think you discussed the $3 million FDIC refund, if I heard correctly. Presumably, that won't repeat.
But will the reversion back up or sort of come all at once and then expenses stabilize or is this going to build kind
of steadily throughout the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek S. Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
It'll pop-up a little bit without the $3 million that you're talking about. And then it just slowly glides up in second and
third quarter. Part of it, as you expect to be marketing expense. Part of it is technology expense as we continue to
roll out products and features. And then it's really filling out the hiring that we started last year, but continue into
this year as we add RMs into our key markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I mean, if you remember, we had a reduction in force at the end of last year, but at the same time we started the
hiring. So we got ahead of the hiring pretty well and we're on track there. But it didn't happen in one fell swoop
much as the reduction in force did. So that will slowly build on revenue producers as the year goes on.

Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Andy, maybe just a thought or two on overall customer demand for the
industry as a whole, there's just not been a heck of a lot of loan demand, particularly on the commercial side. You
all are a bit of a unique animal given the build out of the bank and the rebuild out. And then the other factors, I
guess you just operate in healthier markets generally. But I was hoping that you could maybe provide a thought or
two on overall demand and investment appetite among your customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, there's certainly awareness of the macro environment. I mean, it's impossible not to know that that's true.
But what I would say is the quality of folks that we have and the quality of people that we're adding, they typically
have a following. So, we are not – we don't have to stretch on credit. It is simply a matter that we have more
commercial bankers than we did before.
On the consumer side, it's really a function on the customer side, it's a function that we've built out capabilities.
But on the commercial loan side, we expect a steady growth within the team. And the quality of the folks that
we're hiring, they're frankly attracting more quality. And so, as we go along, it's building on itself. And we expect
based on what we're looking at right now for the next 30 and 60 days, because we track very closely the pipeline
of conversations we're having, we expect that to continue. And so as that happens, you hire somebody, they get
on boarded, they have to talk to a customer, then they get a loan packet and then they book it. And that takes
time. And so that's why we feel pretty bullish about as we head into fourth quarter and some of those deals start
to hit and we head into the first quarter of next year and second quarter and so on. So, really the momentum
we've had is just a quality as opposed to quantity right now. We're going to add on the quantity portion of this and
that'll have a double effect as we head into the second half of the year we expect.

Great. Thanks. And, maybe just more broadly, we've gotten some questions on exposure to the trucking industry
within the C&I book. Just questions given some of the oversupply within the industry there. So I don't know, if you
have the – like the actual exposure for the bank to trucking, transportation or freight.

Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. This is Pat Ahern. It's pretty small, call it $700 million in commitments. We actually just got done with – as
part of our deep dives that we're doing on a quarterly basis, we did just carve out trucking and transportation this
quarter, pretty happy with the results. Don't see a lot of emerging risk there. Certainly, the industry has seen some
migration given volume changes, giving some overcapacity within the space. But our clients seem to be bouncing
back, resizing. We're starting to see some of the shipping rates and spot rates kind of bottom out here and there.
So we feel pretty good about where we're at.
