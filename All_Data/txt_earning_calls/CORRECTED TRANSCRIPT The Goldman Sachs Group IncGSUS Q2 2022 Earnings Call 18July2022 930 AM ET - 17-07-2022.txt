Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
recorded today, July 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.

Carey Halio
Head-Investor Relations, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second
quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the
Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-
GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the

joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis
Coleman.
Let me pass the call to David.

David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Carey and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance this
quarter. There's no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of
macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset prices, market activity, and
confidence.
We see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy and what's unusual about this in particular period is that both
demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events namely the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In my
dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in
their supply chains. Our economists meanwhile say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second
half of the year. The answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely.
Given all of this, we are seeing shifts in monetary policy, and those shifts will continue to tighten economic
conditions. I expect there's going to be more volatility and there's going to be more uncertainty. And in light of the
current environment, we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically. Our risk management culture
and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the firm. That said, there is
nothing about this environment that changes our strategy, and we are committed to our medium-term targets. We
have a strong client franchise, and we remain focused on providing differentiated service. We benefit from the
diversity of our businesses and our global footprint. In light of the environment, we're certainly taking deliberate
action on capital and expenses, but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our firm.
Let me now turn to our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $11.9 billion and
generated earnings per share of $7.73, an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 11.4%. Our book value per share
finished the quarter at $302, up 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. In Investment Banking, we
remain the number one advisor in M&A and equity capital markets, and though capital markets activity has
declined, our dialogue and engagement continues to be strong. This quarter again reaffirmed our strategy to be

global, broad and deep in our leading Global Markets franchise. Each week, clients turn to us for our market
expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment.
Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification of our businesses across the segment. I'm
very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help
our clients manage risk and meet their financing needs. In this environment, our on-balance sheet investments
face significant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in 2021. Our management and other fees
were resilient, as we remained focused on growing fee-based revenue streams across our Asset Management
and Wealth Management segments and further reducing our on-balance sheet investments as markets allow. And
in Consumer, we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both organically and through
partnerships.
Before turning it over to Denis, let me spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve
stress test results. I was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buffer, especially because the test this
year was more challenging than in the past. This is a reflection of the progress we are making in our strategic
evolution. That said, we will advance our efforts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to
reduce our capital requirements over time.
Following the stress test results, our board of directors also declared a 25% increase quarterly dividend to $2.50
per share. This follows an increase of 60% in 2021 and over 50% in 2019. In addition, with regard to our GSIB
buffer, while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last three
years, it is our current plan to target a 3% GSIB surcharge. This intention is driven by the recent operating
environment as well as client needs. Should these change, we will naturally reevaluate.
In closing, I remain confident in our ability to navigate the market environment, serve our clients and create long-
term value for shareholders. Despite the uncertainty we face, we continue to drive this organization forward by
executing our client-oriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time.
I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 2 of the presentation. In the second quarter,
we generated net revenues of $11.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of
$7.73. We re-posted a return on common equity of 10.6% and return on tangible equity of 11.4%.
Turning to performance by segment, starting on page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion,
down 41% versus a year ago. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion. Our global M&A franchise remains
strong, as we closed over 115 deals for approximately $380 billion of deal volume in the quarter, further
strengthening our number-one lead table position. Equity underwriting net revenues were $131 million. Industry
volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility.
Despite this, we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves.
Debt underwriting net revenues were $457 million, where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate
increases in the quarter. While our Investment Banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year, it is still
higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to 2021. We feel good about the quality of our backlog
based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive
repositioning of client portfolios. But we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago, driven by hedge gains
associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain
commitments from our acquisition financing activities. We saw continued growth in our transaction banking
business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the
second quarter, generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date.
Moving to Global Markets on page 4. Segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-
year. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity, as we facilitated risk intermediation for
clients amid a volatile market.
Looking at FICC on page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter. In FICC intermediation we saw a
50% increase in revenues, with three of our five FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues
versus the prior year, reflecting the strength and breadth of our diversified franchise. Our macro franchise
remained incredibly active, as we helped clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued
volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues and rates, commodities and currencies.
And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in
FICC financing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity, which helped deliver record
results.
Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues
fell 2% year-over-year, due to a more challenging market making environment. Activity was also impacted by
lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago
and 14% versus the first quarter. Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for
various forms of financing from our clients. Growth in equities financing, coupled with record performance in FICC
financing, is a reflection of our strategy to grow client financing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our
overall Global Markets revenues this quarter.
Moving to Asset Management on page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower
than the second quarter of last year. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by net
losses from our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39%
year-over-year. This increase was driven by the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of
$305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP, which contributed roughly $170
million of management and other fees this quarter.
Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter. More
specifically, on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of
the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440
million of net revenues. We generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the
portfolio. Additionally, we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated
investment entities.
These revenues were partially offset by approximately $100 million of marks particularly in the technology and
consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party
funds, and in the second quarter, we raised over $20 billion of commitments. We also harvested over $1 billion of
on-balance sheet equity investments.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
The pace of our realizations this quarter was influenced by both macro and micro drivers, with persistent volatility
in equity markets making it more difficult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debit investment
activities in Asset Management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago, as net interest income of $275
million was partly offset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening.
I'll turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on page 9. We produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the
second quarter, up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both Wealth Management and
Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Wealth Management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year,
driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While Private banking and lending
net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record revenues last quarter, revenues were up 23% year-on-
year, due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $608 million in the second
quarter, rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the first quarter.
Now moving to page 10. Total firmwide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined firmwide management
and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. We expect our fee revenues to
continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this
year.
On page 11, total firmwide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to
the first quarter, due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was
$176 billion, up $10 billion versus the first quarter, primarily due to growth in Corporate, Wealth Management and
residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561
million in the first quarter.
Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled
losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter. Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remained
strong, as reflected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we
do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking
mitigating actions as appropriate.
Now let's turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 11% year-
over-year. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation
expenses were $4 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by integration and run rate expenses related to
the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology and higher
levels of business activity. Together, NNIP and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-
compensation expenses this quarter.
Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely re-examining all of our forward spending and
investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we're taking a number of actions to improve
our operating efficiency. Specifically, we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain
professional fees going forward though these actions will take some time to be reflected in our results. We are
keeping in mind, however, that while we're being disciplined about our expenses we are not doing so to the
detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy.
Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity tier one ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under
the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buffer to our
current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year. This past quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to
shareholders including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700

million. As David noted earlier, in the third quarter, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25%
to $2.50 per share.
Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current
operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we
are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price.
In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reflect our ability to navigate volatile markets while actively
supporting our clients. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which will help us
serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth
strategy and delivering for our shareholders.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. I apologize if I missed it within your remarks, but can you tell us what the P&L contribution
from the $1 billion or so in dispositions as a private equity book was? And I want to ask that in the context of when
people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets,
they want to see why you have confidence. And what about the portfolio gives you such confidence that it wasn't
as affected by what's going on in the public markets? Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Glenn. It's Denis. Let me take that for you. So we made a number of remarks with respect to the
composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. And specifically, we made note of event-driven gains of
approximately $380 million during the quarter. We noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across
consumer and technology sectors. And what I would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on
a very, very granular basis. It's comprised of both corporate and real estate assets and we look at the
performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance on average, they're growing
north of 20%. And if we were to take a look at some public comparable albeit an imperfect one, those are growing
in negative fashion. And so it reflects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of
those particular businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Very much appreciated. And then one quick follow-up. Obviously ECM, DCM pipelines are down a lot given
what we've seen. But you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. I wonder if you can expand on that a
little bit because we haven't seen a lot of activity these days in M&A. Thanks.

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Loom, what I would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number which is
quite significant at $1.2 billion. And we have our sustained number one market share position across both
announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. I think this is an
environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what's
particularly strategic for them.
The nature of the transactions that they may be considering could very well be different in their complexion than a
year ago, but nevertheless our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them
navigate the market. So we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. There's
no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if confidence were impaired, we
could see some softening even in our advisory activities. But to-date, they've been strong.
On the underwriting side, that's much more a reflection of the current capital markets receptivity. And again strong
levels of client engagement, we like our backlog, but it is – there will be a better market environment required in
order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that
backlog.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, David and Denis. So you posted pretty strong results this morning. You continue to take market
share in trading, ROE year-to-date is 13%, just pretty good given the backdrop. But, man, you guys' tone sounds
very, very cautious. So what exactly are you worried about in the macro backdrop, maybe just more specifically?
And how does that impact your thinking on a timeline to achieve medium-term ROE targets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I'll start, Christian. I don't know if Denis will add anything to it. I think our tone is cautious because the environment
is uncertain. The environment is very uncertain. We don't have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary
policy will navigate the inflationary environment that exists, but there's no question that economic conditions are
tightening to try to control inflation, and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate
confidence and also consumer activity in the economy. I think it's hard to gauge exactly how that will play out, and
so I think it's prudent for us to be cautious.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Now, that said, I think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader, much more diverse,
much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago. And we benefited
from that in the context of the quarter. So we feel good about our ability to operate, I would say that at the
moment while there's a lot of uncertainty, clients are still relatively active. Denis was just talking about M&A
activity, and our clients are active. Capital marks activity is obviously down.
This is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it's certainly an environment where
people are more cautious about risk. So we continue to monitor it, but I think it's prudent and appropriate for us to
be cautious. And if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we're evaluating things with respect to
resources. We're being flexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. By the way,
we don't know that the environment is going to get worse. The environment might get better too. So I just think it's
a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense.
Now with respect to our targets, I want to be clear we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on
meeting those targets, we don't see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets.
I'm not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way. But I would
say in what's been certainly a very difficult first half of the year if you think about the headwinds we faced in both
public equity markets because of the war in Ukraine and the unwind of the business in Russia, et cetera, I think
there have been some exogenous events in this first half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than
we might see in other times going forward. So we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we'll
continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Thanks. Maybe switch over to the consumer business, wanted to get your latest thinking on that business.
How is the profitability curve tracking? How are you thinking about that business going into a downturn? And then
just strategically given the pressures on fintechs out there, I wondered if there's any sort of opportunity here to try
to grow faster either organically or inorganically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I appreciate the question. And I guess I'd just step back and I'd highlight that we've been building a
business from scratch here. It certainly takes investment, and we've been making investment. And we've been
pretty clear that we have a long-term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the Consumer Banking
business. Now, we've been at it, as I think you know, for five years. We've built out a really good deposit platform.
We've built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology. We have a loans platform. We have
some technology around an Invest platform, and we've also added GreenSky. With that portfolio of product
offerings, we've told you in our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. You can
obviously see this quarter that we're making progress on revenue in the business. And as we noted, I think when
we spoke in February at the update, we said the vast majority of the build costs associated with the products that
will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. And so I remind you of that comment.
On a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves, as we grow the
business. And just a reminder, CECL requires very, very significant upfront reserve build. So we continue to feel
good about the progress we're making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to Goldman
Sachs over time and we're committed to the journey that we've set out on to make sure that we do just that over
time.

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I just – the one thing I realize, Christian, that I didn't touch on is we're very, very focused on the credit box and
thinking about the credit box. During the early part of the pandemic when there was enormous uncertainty, we
tightened the credit box meaningfully. As Denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don't see significant
indications of credit deterioration in the consumer, but given tightening economic conditions, we're watching that
very, very carefully. And to the degree that we saw different signals in the short term, we would adjust our credit
box very dynamically.

Steven Chubak Q

So maybe just as a follow-up on the credit discussion, I was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan
growth. You noted that you could be very dynamic. But just given some of the upward pressure on provision from
both growth math as well as the macro deterioration, I was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how
we should be thinking about through the cycle provision expectation in a more normal operating backdrop.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Steven, thanks. It's Denis. Let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide
some context. So as we noted with respect to the consumer portion, that's really driven by ongoing growth in the
asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality. And on the wholesale side, we obviously model the
macroeconomic outlook. And when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the first
quarter into the second quarter, our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables,
from GDP growth to employment levels, to inflation, probability of recession, possibility of stagflation, et cetera.
And so we reweighted our scenarios and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our
wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. We continue to invest in our franchise. We think it's important

to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the
way.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Very helpful. And maybe just for my follow-up for David on capital, you did cite plans to manage to the lower GSIB
surcharge of 3%. I know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as 3.5%. I was hoping you could
speak to the specific actions you are taking to mitigate the GSIB score, whether we should be contemplating any
level of revenue attrition from those actions? And does your ability to manage to that lower GSIB surcharge inform
the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Appreciate the question. And let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. As monetary and fiscal policy
were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very, very rapidly.
In the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and therefore
expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the profit opportunity for the firm. That environment has
certainly shifted in 2022, and while our clients are still active, they're not active to the same degree that they were
in 2021. And you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the Street.
In stating that where we're focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level,
we are making a forward assumption that's consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year. I'd note
one of the things that I said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different
conclusion, we'll obviously evaluate that and change that. But based on the experience we've had over the last six
months and the revenue opportunity we're capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue
opportunity that's available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation. And that
should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. But I would think at
this point in time, looking at that and Denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we're
certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. One of the other areas for capital deployment obviously is in growing the consumer business,
and I know you've got GreenSky under the belt, the General Motors card. Apple's doing gangbusters. So just
wanted to get a sense from you as to how you're thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new
partnership opportunities, or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So thanks, Betsy. So, look, I think what I'd say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership
opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology, et cetera, that are
interested in doing things with us. At the same point, we've done a bunch over the course of the last five years to
build this business. And as we've said, we put a couple of big partnerships in the ground in cards, we've started
an Invest platform. We're now working to integrate GreenSky.

I think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute
at a very high level. Certainly, as we get out into 2023 and 2024, we'll be more open to other partnerships and
other meaningful things going forward. But at the moment, we're focused on really executing on what we've put
forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, okay. And then separately on transaction banking, you've given us a lot of good metrics along the way on
how that business has been building out. Maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us
a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there. I would think you're running ahead
of plan based on that or expected to by year-end. And how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or
elsewhere? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Hey, Betsy, it's Denis. Maybe I'll take that one. As you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking
business, its progress year-to-date and the forward. We continue to improve on each of the metrics that we've
been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion, revenues year-to-date $175 million. And
importantly, we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational.
Operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter. So we'll continue to
focus on growing overall clients, balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. It's
obviously a profitable business already. And it's a business, as David highlighted, that benefits from leveraging
the relationships that we have already inside the firm to grow it incrementally.

Hi, Mike.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess I'm thinking in terms of the trade-offs that you have to make, David, in terms of both capital and expenses.
On capital, I mean, you talked about a broader, diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream. But then we
get the Fed stress test results, and you guys finish in last place, albeit better than last year, but still last place. So I
guess the regulators don't see it the same way that you do. And that the trade-off between managing for lower
regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. And then the other dynamic decision is managing
expenses lower. As you said, you're taking a closer look at that. The trade-off between ensuring good profit
margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I'm not sure there was a question there. I think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. I mean, I
would highlight while it's a fair comment that our SCB is higher than everyone else's because of our current
business mix, if that's what you refer to as last place, I would comment for the stress test, we came in first place is
that we were the only firm that actually saw their SCB decrease and many institutions saw their SCB increase
very meaningfully.
Now, I don't take that as a victory lap. We're early in the journey of taking assets off our balance sheet. But I still
do think, Mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to
continue to make that business much less RWA dense. And I do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in
the stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward in future tests as we continue to change that mix.
I'm not satisfied with where we are on the journey of making the firm more fee-based and more resilient, but I am
satisfied that we've made meaningful progress, and I think the results this quarter show the diversity of the
business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. And so as someone who has
followed the industry and our firm for quite some time, I think the performance in this environment is reflective of
the beginning of that evolution. But you're exactly right. We have to constantly balance between investing in the
future and providing resources to serve clients when they're active and driving those shareholder returns that kind
of is our true north of what we're trying to drive toward. So, yes, it's a balance. I think we're trying to strike that
balance appropriately, and we're going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we
can striking that balance effectively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And on the second part, as it relates to expenses, it sounds like you're going to not quite Plan B, but you're getting
ready in case you need a Plan B. How long do these deals stay alive before it pencils down and they just say, all
right, we're going to wait for the next cycle. I mean, it seems like with every month that passes, the chance that
capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines. How long do you and the markets have
before things just stay lower for longer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. We always – I think we're very nimble allocators of resources; financial
resources, human resources, we try to have a very, very flexible, nimble approach. And so of course, we've
expressed early in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we're going to be cautious, of course.
We will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse.
With respect to Capital Markets activity, I think I told you at the beginning of the year in our January call, on
January 15, that I did not expect us to see the level of Capital Markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. And
I wouldn't call that as normal. So when you talk about Capital Markets activity going back to what we saw in the
past couple of years, I don't think we're going back to that anytime soon. But I do think if you look at Capital
Markets activity kind of average levels over the last seven years, take a period five years, seven years and look at
average levels, I'd be very surprised if we don't get back to some average level of Capital Markets activity
sometime over the course of the next few quarters.

And history would just tell you that, that doesn't mean it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get
increasingly uncertain. But generally speaking, one of the things that affects Capital Markets activities is people
have to reset their mind around valuations. They have to reset their mind around capital costs. And that happens
relatively quickly because people have plans. They have commitments. They have to invest. And as soon as they
get their minds around that and they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that's
available to them.
And so I'd be very surprised if we don't see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of Capital
Markets activity. And we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difficult longer, but
it's not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we're headed to a super negative environment. But it is uncertain. It
is a little bumpy, and so we're going to proceed cautiously.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to start on expenses. So you indicated
that you're adjusting the investments, but it sounds more like that's about slowing the hiring outlook. So maybe
the impact there has a lag, and we're more talking about year-end or even into 2023 and more on the comp side.
So curious about, number one, whether that's a fair interpretation and then, number two, best way to think about
non-comp if we adjust for the legal charge and what – and maybe some higher BC&E this quarter, is this the right
jumping off point for non-comp? Or might some of that expense diligence that you flagged also put some
downward pressure on the non-comp line? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So two components to your question and obviously we manage the firm to an efficiency ratio, looking at
both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation. I mean, as you would have seen through the first half
of the year, we have taken compensation expense down significantly, $3.5 billion less comp expense in the first
half versus the first half last year. And at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation
side of the equation. As we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring,
decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at
the end of the year, something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just
being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efficiency of our human capital resources, given overall
environment.
And you're right. Some of that will take time to reflect itself through the P&L, so I think that's the right expectation.
You are correct in anticipating that we're also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions
there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non-compensation expense. Some
of them are dovetail well with investments that we're making to grow the firm. And some of those activities we'll
obviously look to continue. We may slow the pace, but we'll continue to grow the activities that support the growth
of the firm.
And there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we
actually see the impact of inflation impacting the overall level of expense. And so that's just going to require us to
work harder to manage towards our overall efficiency target, which is I think the comments and references that
both David and I have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks for that color, Denis. Appreciate it. And for the second question, I'm curious. We've seen –
you talk a lot about M&A and how obviously your Investment Bank franchise is holding up really well. But just sort
of a question around the environment. We've seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date, and started to
hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. So curious whether or not that's also
what you're seeing and whether or not there's any concern that that availability – that sort of availability might
become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think it's a good – I think it's an appropriate thing to look at carefully. I'd say at the moment real availability issues
are limited to some very, very stressed borrowers or some very out of favor sectors. But I do think sometime
people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. And so I would say at the moment the
bigger thing that's slowing down Capital Markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment.
Ultimately, companies need to raise capital. They find that new clearing price.
But I do think that if the environment stays very, very difficult from an economic perspective, there are certain
sectors where availability is an issue. And there are a couple of them now. I'd point to retail as one where certainly
capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully. And so I think we'll watch this very cautiously. But
again, I would tell you that there's a mindset when you go through this and a resetting that's going on. And I think
ultimately markets find clearing prices. And Capital Markets, there's certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity
available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. The most levered
companies will have a tougher time in this environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean, another thing I would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity. So as an
example, in our FICC financing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for financing, they have
important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have financed. And to the extent that there's less availability
of financing across the Street, that presents an opportunity for us, given the way that we're currently positioned,
our focus on financing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users.

Devin Ryan Q

the evolution of that offering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of
that offering in the coming quarters? There's been some recent press just suggesting that you guys are better
integrating that with the broader Goldman capabilities. So love to just get an update on your thinking there.

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well we obviously – we made an acquisition in the space. It's something that we're focused on as an opportunity
for the firm. But I'd say, at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small, but I

think as we look forward over the course of the next three to five years, it will be an area that we see opportunity
in and we'll turn more focus to expanding. That's why we made this acquisition, and we think it's an interesting
opportunity for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then a follow-up here. Denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading
client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a
number of firms in the industry. It didn't seem to impact your trading or financing results. But can you give us any
sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? Is there another lag that could exist here? Or are
clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading
outlook as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I appreciate the question. I mean, connecting it back to some of the comments that David's made looking
back over the course of the last couple years. We've gone through an extraordinary period. We see an ongoing
transition into a new type of market environment. I'm sure there are some clients that have looked to delever
themselves and position for the current operating environment. We continue to see very high levels of client
opportunity. There was a lot of engagement in the second quarter, particularly in the macro businesses, clients
approaching us to help them mediate risk, other clients looking for financing, which is why we had record
performance in FICC financing.
And I think as we look forward, we're obviously starting the quarter with a buffer to our minimum capital position. I
mean, very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. We think there should be some good
opportunities. And there may be clients that incrementally turn to us to help them navigate the opportunity. So I
think we feel well set up and we're optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the strategic targets, David. So you said multiple times on
the call that you don't see any reason why Goldman won't achieve I think your ROTE target 15% to 17% by 2024.
When we think about that, I think where investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and
how quickly you can flex expenses. Just give us a sense of when we think about year-to-date ROTE about 13%,
the journey from [ph] year to your (00:48:55) targets, how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better,
versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more profitable without any improvement in
the macro?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, if we stayed in a macro environment, look, it's a good question. I understand where the question comes
from. If we stayed in a macro environment, like the first six months of this year, for the next five years, I think it
would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns, although I do think that we'd be more resilient and
probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly. By the way, not just Goldman Sachs
if you really had that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment, and people

would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, et cetera, over time to make sure that they could
deliver appropriately for shareholders. I don't expect – I think we had a very – I think this has been a very difficult
six months. And there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. I don't expect to have the
same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months.
Now, that doesn't mean that the environment couldn't be worse or there couldn't be different headwinds that
create different issues, but I think to kind of take what's going on with some of the exogenous impact over the
course of the last six months and translate it as a three- or four-year thing forward, that's just not our base case.
That's not our base case. And if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with
respect to expense changes, investments in the business, et cetera. But that's not our base case, and so we
continue to move forward with the base case where we're pretty confident that we can deliver the level of
revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those
returns. And I'd just highlight that in the first half of the year, we're not that far off from what we said we need to
accomplish over the next three years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just recognizing it's very challenging to predict trading activity, but
when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility, do you see, just given all the uncertainty in macros
for Central Bank actions, etcetera, in terms of FICC trading, things to remain strong as we think about the back
half of the year, just whatever is in your crystal ball.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
The good volatilities, bad volatility has never been an expression that I'd like. I think about our business in
markets as a business we're serving our clients and we're making sure that we're meeting their needs. That's why
we've been very focused over the last three, four years on really improving our approach to our clients, really
improving our market share with our clients, adding financing as a capability to our clients, which is much more
resilient and therefore puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before.
Now, that doesn't mean that there can't be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. I'm not going to
make a forecast as to what looks forward, but I think the investments we've made in our client focus, in our market
shares and our financing business, all give those markets businesses more balance as we go forward. There will
be environments where clients are more active, and we can capture that. And there'll be environments where
clients are a little bit more quiet, but we're prepared to serve them. And I think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter
and continue to look over three-year periods, there's a very big business that generates very accretive returns and
serves our clients well.

Operator: Pardon the interruption. We'll move on to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserve on slide 11. And just wanted to ask specifically
on the consumer book, you've got about 13% reserve to loans. Obviously charge-offs are only 2% and change.
But how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning? Or just more tough macro environment?
How would you frame that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I think I would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. So your seasoning point is fair as well. It's
a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. There's an element of
seasoning. There's an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to cause us to
conclude that that's the appropriate place to be. You do make reference to charge-offs. Obviously, firm-wide,
they're flat quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale down slightly. Consumer is up a little bit. But those are some of the
factors that we also take into account and look at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And I know earlier you were asked about through the cycle provisioning. And anything specifically on consumer
charge-offs as we think about those portfolios? What you would expect once you have the seasoning and what
those levels would be, not in a recession but just more kind of through the cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, I think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation. So whether the impact
presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year, the
starting point – the overall health of the consumer is very strong, the credit environment for consumer has been
very, very benign, and so I think you need to take stock in sort of where you're starting from. Obviously, if the
environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we
would expect an increase in that regard.

Sure. I'll answer at a very high level, and then I'm going to have Denis walk you through some very specific
details. I am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. Comfortable is probably the wrong
word. I'm pleased with the progress. I'd like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. And I think we're
going to do – we're going to make progress over the course of the coming 12, 24 months. Our progress – we've
made a lot of progress. It was slowed also by the fact that we went through a period in 2021 where the value of a
lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. But why don't I have Denis walk you
through...

...some high-level numbers that we put out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So couple things. I think we're well on our way in terms of the journey. We remain completely committed to
the progress and the direction of travel. You'll note there were no particular additions over the course of the last
quarter. We continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. We have a detailed asset-
by-asset plan that we are executing on. And looking at our results coming through CCAR, obviously the Fed
recognized our strong PPNR, but we also suspect that the way that they concluded the ultimate decision on SCB
had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shock that they choose
to apply against that portfolio.
And so that's incremental affirmation that we've selected the right strategy, and then if anything we should
continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall
environment and the ability to execute. But I think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing
those exposures is completely unchanged.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ECM business.
Obviously according to the Deal Logic numbers, the first six months of this year we all know were very weak, and
market conditions we recognize as being the driver. But, David, you alluded to maybe that price expectations are
coming down. Was it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? Was it lower valuations
that pushed them there? What did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the
industry, not just for you folks?

Yeah, I think it's a combination. I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all those things. You had a meaningful
decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. You also had real volatility. And so people go
down the road, doing an IPO, it's like a tanker. It's heading down the road. It takes months and months and
months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. And you get your mind and you get with all the
shareholders that you're going to go public at a particular value, particular price, and all of a sudden the value of

the price is 20% or 30% less, and the whole tanker just stops. They can't turn on a dime and get everybody's
mind reset. And so I think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact.
The period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in
2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000 and 2001. And
then in March 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. It was the beginning of decline in
the Nasdaq, where the Nasdaq ultimately went down 85%. I'm not saying that that's going to happen again here.
But really, equity issuance shut off in late 2001, and 2002 was a really, really anemic year for equity issuance and
started picking back up again in 2003. And so there's a reset process with all of this. And I think we're on the
journey of people's expectation around valuations being reset.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Can I just – I just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% GSIB and sort of
your comments about lower client activity versus last year. But I think on the flip side, you guys are pretty
optimistic around grow – still growing the financing business. It looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or
flat year-over-year. Loans are up. Balance sheet is up. So is this just something about balance sheet and RWA
growth slowing? Or is there specific areas you think will shrink or you can cut?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So I think we're looking at this holistically. A lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute,
to hit targets over time. Given the environment that we're in right now, we see an opportunity to target a 3% GSIB.
And obviously is for the benefit of 2024 and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. And so in terms
of our ability to target that level, given what we've seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity, et
cetera, we think we can do that reasonably efficiently. We've had discussions with our business leaders. They
know that that's the plan. That's what they're working on.
David did make a comment that should the environment change significantly and the needs of our clients change,
we would reevaluate. But the current plan is to target that level of GSIB. And we've been obviously growing
resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. But in addition to targeting a 3%
GSIB, we can at the same time deploy other financial resources to attractive client opportunities. So our
expectation is that we'll be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while
targeting a 3% GSIB.

Jim Mitchell Q

Can you help us a little bit with the specifics of what you're actually targeting? Or is that, you're unwilling to
disclose that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
We are currently targeting a 3% GSIB. We're not putting out a particular GSIB score that we're targeting.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2022
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Try this again here. Just wanted to follow up on the $20 billion of commitments in third-party funds that
you highlighted in the quarter. Clearly there's still strong momentum. As you think about this market backdrop and
the outlook for that, are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I would say, Dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we're not seeing significant change in behavior. When
you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have significant
allocations. Obviously if the overall values of the portfolios decrease, the allocation percentage would shift, and so
that will slow down capital raising. But I think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, I
still think there's a secular growth trend around alternatives that's very, very attractive. Probably not at the exact
same pace and ebullience that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves
forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space.
I would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as bigger participant
but there's been a lot of retail flow into the alternative space. And there – my insight there is that is slowing but it's
not turned off. And it's still adequate. And from what I can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very,
very high-end private wealth business, there's still significant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so
something to watch. If the environment got much worse, maybe that would change. But at the moment, not seeing
indications if the changes are meaningful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. And then just as a follow-up on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments,
you have historically given a line of sight number on these calls. Given, I would assume, the market backdrop in
the short-term, there's just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think that's right. So last quarter we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up
happening. Right now, line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment. That's what we see it
right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call. Obviously if any other questions arise, feel free to give me a
call directly. Thanks so much. We'll speak to you soon.
