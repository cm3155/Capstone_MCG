Q2 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2022
Thank you, Sean. Good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. I'll begin on slide number 4.
Financial and operational results remain strong and demonstrate unique scale and positioning of our businesses.
Broadly speaking, macro uncertainty and market volatility are elevated. The challenges of persistent inflation,
rapidly rising interest rates, quantitative tightening and geopolitical conflict are very real. The combination of these
events occurring simultaneously presents unique challenges that are likely to continue in the quarters ahead.
However, I remain optimistic in Ally's outlook given the strength of our businesses and the power of our people
and culture.
Staying true to our culture has enabled us to successfully grow through various economic environments in the
past, and that will continue as we navigate the environment ahead. Our focus and actions for all stakeholders will
remain rooted in our Do It Right philosophy. In June, we pledged to reach equal media spend across men's and
women's sports beyond the financial impact, supporting equality is the right thing to do, and we hope our pledge
inspires others as well. We're well underway with our recognition of supplier diversity month in July. This initiative
is integral to our broader goals for financial and social inclusion, and while we aren't done, we've seen a
significant increase in diverse spend since the program's inception. Ally will remain nimble and ready to pivot
quickly to the evolving landscape.
We remain intensely focused on controlling what we can control and have further heightened our emphasis on
prudent investment discipline and expense management given the range of possible economic outcomes. Jenn
and I are deeply engaged with our business leaders on ensuring only the most essential projects and hires are
prioritized. Our industry leading auto and insurance businesses have deep relationships with thousands of dealer
customers. Over Ally's history, we have proven to be a reliable and adaptable partner driving growth and value
creation again through various economic cycles. Across Ally Bank we continue to see solid customer momentum
and engagement across the array of complementary businesses. So while different operating and economic
environments will be encountered, we remain true to our long-term strategy of serving customers and staying
nimble as operators.
Let's turn to slide number 5 where I'll touch on a few highlights from 2Q. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.76,
core ROTCE of 23.2% and revenues of $2.2 billion reflected another strong quarter of financial results. ROTCE
was approximately 19%, excluding the impact of OCI. The scale and depth of dealer relationships coupled with
healthy consumer demand drove strong originations in the quarter. That requires a meaningful initial provision
expense under CECL that positions us well to drive accretive risk adjusted returns going forward. Recent CCAR
results conveyed the strength and resilience of our company overall. Our preliminary SCB of 2.5% was down 100
basis points from the 2020 exam. Capital and liquidity levels also remain healthy.
Within auto, consumer originations of $13.3 billion represented our highest quarterly flows since 2006, and
originated yields expanded 75 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 7.8%. Industry vehicle sales were down 21%
and 17% year-over-year across new and used respectively. Despite that headwind, our ability to generate strong
consumer originations shows the scale of our auto business and depth of application flow. Credit normalization in
the second quarter continued in line with expectations, and retail NCOs of 54 basis points remained well below
pre-pandemic levels. We are monitoring for market indicators of consumer health, including wage and price
inflation, employment conditions, deposit balance changes and overall debt payment trends.
From an auto industry production perspective, the story remains consistent. Supply chain challenges continue
and demand remains robust, resulting in low levels of inventory, and therefore support for used vehicle values.
Dealer health also remains very strong. Jenn will discuss used vehicle dynamics in more detail in a moment, and I
think it is very important for you to understand what's actually happening in the industry. Frankly, I'm not sure the
constant focus on used car price implications on Ally's earnings is warranted. With an insurance written premiums

of $262 million reflected lower overall inventory levels and industry sales. Investment portfolio performance
remained solid but below last year's record levels.
Turning to Ally Bank, retail deposit customers exceeded 2.5 million, expanding 6% year-over-year and
representing our 53rd consecutive quarter of customer growth. As we've indicated in recent months, retail
balances were pressured by elevated tax payments observed across the industry. While retail balances declined
nearly $5 billion in the quarter, they were up year-over-year and total deposits of $140 billion account for roughly
85% of our funding profile. Our compelling consumer engagement and product adoption trends remain
compelling. Ally Home originated $900 million in the quarter, reflecting a disciplined approach to navigating a
rising interest rate environment. I also think it's important to note that our partnership model isolated us from some
of the substantial operating volatility others have reported.
Equity markets resulted in a decline in Ally Invest assets, while accounts actually increased 5% versus prior year.
Ally Lending generated record origination volume of $591 million, which nearly doubled year-over-year as we
continued our expansion of merchant relationships and volume in the healthcare and home improvement
verticals. Ally Credit Card reached $1.2 billion of loan balances, up more than 90% year-over-year and now has
over 900,000 active cardholders, up 58% from prior year. And Corporate Finance generated another solid quarter
of loan growth with the held for investment portfolio reaching $8.5 billion. Deep partner relationships and
expansion into new verticals has enabled steady, disciplined growth in that business.
Let's turn to slide number 6 where I'll touch on the value proposition we've established. Ally has a unique
combination of established, leading and scale businesses coupled with newer and growing businesses.
Specifically, more than 10.5 million customers span our leading auto and deposit businesses, and more recently
we benefited from accelerating growth from card, lending and invest, areas we saw as white spaces for our
company.
In Ally Bank, our position as the number one all-digital bank is fueled by more than 2.5 million deposit customers,
which have grown at a nearly 20% annual rate since its founding in 2009. We've been relentlessly focused on
digital disruption and leveraging shifts in consumer preferences, including nearly 100% digital interactions within
deposits and invest.
Within auto, our 100-plus-year history has positioned Ally as the number one prime auto lender, as we've
simultaneously grown dealer relationships to over 22,000, up more than 20% in the past few years. The scale of
our operations enables our full spectrum adaptable approach to consumer and commercial auto lending that has
proven resilient as operating and economic conditions change. Our all-digital auto auction platform provides an
attractive disposition channel and real-time data into used vehicle trends nationwide. Our auto collections team
has also enhanced its digital engagement with consumers. From here, we're focused on strengthening all of our
customer relationships, as higher engagement has significant benefits with a few examples just mentioned and
also highlighted on the page. Looking ahead, we know our customer-centric, modern, digital-first approach will
position us to drive further customer growth, strong engagement and value in the years ahead.
I think the important takeaway is that while COVID might have accelerated the benefits of our business model, we
don't believe a great unwind will happen now as the pandemic is slowing. Our model was built because we
believe it is how consumers want to bank today and in the future. We also think car ownership was again proven
to be a mainstay in consumers' lives. Yes, we will have fluctuations in various quarters just like everyone, but long
term, the company remains poised for substantial value creation. Last quarter, one of our key stakeholders
perhaps said it best; Ally is one of the great corporate transformation stories of our lifetimes.

Obviously, I could not agree anymore and suggested a longer-term focus on our evolution, and sustainable
earnings power is a much better indicator of our focus and success. So we will keep our head down, we will keep
taking care of customers, we will be smart and dynamic operators, and we will be disciplined stewards of capital
deployment. I still firmly believe that is what drives long-term value creation, and that is our focus.
And with that, Jenn, over to you.

Jennifer A. LaClair
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, JB, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 7 with a few consumer health indicators we are
watching closely. Starting with our deposit accounts, the average savings balance remains well above pre-
pandemic levels across all income bands. While balances have started to normalize, they remain robust despite
elevated tax outflows, strong spending and persistent inflation.
In retail auto, we generated a 3% increase in application flow, while industry sales fell 19%. We've continued to
see strong demand, particularly in the higher-income segment where we originate the majority of our loans. On
the bottom left, delinquency levels remain generally favorable, especially in the higher-volume, higher-income
deciles.
And lastly, both frequency and severity metrics remains below 2019 levels, driven by healthy payment trends and
elevated collateral values. While we expect further credit normalization, we are starting from a strong position and
have prudent underwriting and servicing strategies to navigate a variety of macroeconomic environment.
Let's turn to slide 8 where we've included a snapshot of key measures demonstrating the strength of our balance
sheet. Our liquidity, capital and reserves remain robust and above pre-pandemic levels. CET1 ended the quarter
at 9.6%, reflecting nearly $1 billion of excess capital relative to our internal operating target of 9%. And based on
recent CCAR results, our stress capital buffer has declined 100 basis points to 2.5%, resulting in nearly $4 billion
of excess capital relative to SCB requirements. Our deposit portfolio represents 85% of funding relative to 64% in
2018, and we maintain access to multiple efficient funding sources enhanced by our investment grade rating.
Allowance for loan losses of 2.68% or $3.5 billion represents over 2.7 times our reserve level in 2019, and
approximately $900 million higher than CECL day 1.
Detailed results for the quarter are on slide 9. Net financing revenue excluding OID of $1.8 billion grew nearly
$220 million or 14% year-over-year despite a decline in lease revenue. This represents the eighth consecutive
quarter of expanding net financing revenue. Performance in the quarter was driven by continued strength in
origination volumes and auto pricing growth in unsecured consumer products, normalization of excess liquidity
and hedging activity, partially mitigating impacts from short term rate increases. Adjusted other revenue of $448
million reflected solid performance across our insurance, SmartAuction, and consumer banking businesses.
Revenues declined year-over-year as we generated significant investment gains in the prior period.
Provision expense of $304 million reflected robust origination volume and the gradual normalization of credit
performance. Loan growth across retail auto, unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance drove $151
million reserve build. While CECL provisioning is a headwind for the current period, strong originations will drive
accretive long-term risk returns. Net charge-offs in the period of $153 million remained below pre-pandemic
levels, but are up versus prior year, which included a net recovery in the period. Non-interest expense of $1.1
billion includes the seasonal increases in insurance weather losses and continued investment in technology and
business growth. As a reminder, the prior period included one-time items related to the Ally Foundation (sic) [Ally

Charitable Foundation] (00:16:29) and retirement eligibility benefits. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter were
$1.40 and $1.76 respectively, including a $0.33 impact from the provision build.
Moving to slide 10, net interest margin excluding OID of 4.06% expanded 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter
and 49 basis points year-over-year. Total earning assets have been relatively flat as excess cash normalizes, but
total loans and leases are up nearly $15 billion versus prior year. Overall margin expansion reflects the
structurally enhanced balance sheet we have built over several years. Earning asset yield of 5.11% grew 25 basis
points quarter-over-quarter and 42 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the same NII drivers I just mentioned.
Retail auto portfolio yield expanded 10 basis points from the prior quarter as originated yields moved materially
higher. We are pleased we've been able to capture significantly higher rates, while growing origination volume.
As rates have increased our pay-fixed hedges against the retail auto portfolio have delivered a meaningful linked
quarter benefit. On an absolute basis hedges were a slight drag on yields for the full quarter but have moved into
a positive carry position and will help drive portfolio yields above 7% in the third quarter. Yield also expanded
across commercial portfolios and credit card as they benefit from higher rates. Looking forward, we expect
earning asset yield expansion driven by our leading market position in auto finance, continued growth across our
newer consumer portfolios, and the impact of higher interest rates. Turning to liabilities, cost of funds increased
13 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but declined 11 basis points year-over-year. The increase in average deposit
cost reflects higher benchmark rates and a competitive market for deposits, particularly in the direct bank space.
Other borrowings increased $5 billion on average this quarter, driven by FHLB advances and efficient funding
alternative. Broadly speaking, funding costs will move higher as the fed continues with the tightening cycle, but we
remain confident in our ability to manage interest expense due to our customer value proposition that goes
beyond rate, core funding status and access to diverse funding sources. The growth and strength of our
businesses on both sides of the balance sheet allowed us to achieve a 4-plus percent NIM this quarter. For the
next few quarters the rapid increase in benchmark rates will pressure margins as deposits initially repriced faster
than earning assets. Over the medium term, we continue to see a strong NIM in the upper 3%.
Turning to slide 11, our CET1 ratio declined to 9.6% as earnings supported $3 billion in RWA growth and $600
million in share repurchases. Last week we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share and has completed
approximately $1.2 billion in repurchases through June. We remain on track to complete our $2 billion buyback
program for 2022, and will remain flexible and disciplined considering potential changes in the macroeconomic
environment. On the bottom of the slide, shares outstanding have declined 17% since we resumed share
repurchases in 2021 and 35% since the inception of our buyback program in 2016. Our priorities remain focused
on maintaining prudent capital levels, while investing in the growth of our businesses and returning capital to
shareholders.
Let's turn to slide 12 to review asset quality trends. Consolidated net charge-offs of 49 basis points remain below
pre-pandemic levels and are normalizing in line with expectations. The charge-offs of a specific credit in the
corporate finance portfolio added 9 basis points to the consolidated NCO rates for the quarter. As a reminder,
NCOs in this portfolio can be uneven, but the business has averaged annualized losses below 30 basis points
over a sustained period. In addition, our new unsecured consumer products will drive higher consolidated losses
and higher risk adjusted returns as they grow. Retail auto portfolio performance continues to reflect resilient
consumer payment trends and favorable loss given default rates, supported by elevated vehicle collateral values.
In the bottom right, 30-day delinquencies increased due to typical seasonality and a gradual normalization of
consumer trends, but remained below 2019. 60-day delinquencies are equal to 2019, however, they are elevated
due to the impact of strategic repossession timing changes that have improved further loss rates. We expect

gradual increase in delinquencies as consumer trends normalize post-pandemic, and we are closely monitoring
additional inflationary pressures. We have continued to invest in talent and technology to enhance our servicing
and collection capabilities, and remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit in a variety of
environments.
On slide 13, consolidated coverage increased 5 basis points to 2.68%, reflecting growth in our retail auto,
unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance portfolios. The total reserve increased to $3.5 billion or $900
million higher than CECL day 1 levels. Retail auto coverage of 3.51% increased 2 basis points and remains 17
basis points higher than CECL day 1. Under our CECL methodology, our baseline forecast assumes stable
unemployment, ending the year slightly below 3.5% before gradually reverting to a historical mean of about 6.5%.
On slide 14, total deposits of $140 billion declined $2 billion as increases in brokered CDs partially offset a decline
in retail deposits. Retail balances decreased $5 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven by elevated tax outflows. As
we've mentioned previously, our portfolio includes significant balances from affluent depositors, generally more
susceptible to tax liability outflows. Consistent with prior cycles, we expect flows from traditional banks to direct
banks will increase as the price gap widens, especially with savings rates now exceeding 1%. We saw retail
deposit growth in June and continue to expect growth on a full year basis. We added another 28,000 customers in
Q2, our 53rd consecutive quarter of customer growth. Loyalty and engagement across our 2.5 million customers
are reflected in industry leading and consistent retention of 96% and growth of multi-product relationships.
Turning to slide 15, we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms. Deposits
serve as a gateway to our other banking products, which enhance brand loyalty, drive engagement and deepen
customer relationships. We also see a clear path for expansion among our newer point-of-sale lending and credit
card products which are helping to offset more cyclical businesses like mortgage. Our focus on delivering
integrated, diversified and digital-first capabilities for our customers supports our outlook for continued growth and
accretive returns in the years ahead. Let's turn to slide 16 to review auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of
$600 million was driven by growth in retail auto balances and yield, and solid credit performance. The increase in
provision expense versus prior periods resulted from CECL reserve build to support over $13 billion in consumer
originations with attractive risk adjusted returns.
Looking at the bottom left, the originated yield of 7.82% was up 75 basis points from the prior quarter reflecting
significant pricing actions. We have put more than 180 basis points of price into the market through last week and
expect to originate at over 8% for the quarter while maintaining consistent underwriting standards reflective of
strong dealer engagement. While pricing data will move around from quarter-to-quarter and should be viewed
through the tightening cycle, we are pleased with the momentum to-date and remain confident in our ability to
generate higher yields from here. We continue to see elevated retail trading activity and lessee buyouts, which
create temporary headwinds for retail portfolio yields and remarketing gains that will normalize over time. I'll talk
about these dynamics in more detail on the next page.
On slide 17, we have provided perspective on used vehicle values and the associated impact to current period
earnings. We are aware of and understand the heightened focus on used values given the 60% increase over the
past two years. As we've outlined before, there are offsetting impacts to Ally that net over time as used vehicle
values rise and fall in this environment. Elevated collateral values continue to drive a positive impact of loss
severity, which contributes to lower net charge-offs. From a lease perspective, option proceeds remain elevated,
with more than 85% of lease terminations are purchased by the lessee or dealer, which limits our ability to
monetize the off lease gains.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2022
While collateral values have been a benefit to lease gains and credit losses, the main driver of increased used
vehicle values has been limited supply of new inventory. Lower inventory has reduced commercial assets by
approximately $10 billion, and has increased retail trade and activity, both of which are a headwind to net interest
income. We expect each of these factors to gradually reverse as supply chains improve and new vehicle
production normalizes. These dynamics will likely occur unevenly over the next several quarters and years, but in
aggregate should not result in a meaningful impact to earnings on a net basis.
Turning to slide 18, our leading Agile platform is built to adapt to dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive
manner, reflected in our performance and the multiyear growth of our dealers. We now have over 22,000 active
dealer relationships, up more than 20% over the past three years. We continue to focus on deepening these
relationships and increasing application flow.
In the upper right, ending consumer assets expanded to $93 billion, up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Retail auto
assets increased $3 billion in the quarter and are up over $6 billion from prior year. Based on current market
conditions, we see a clear path to over $45 billion of consumer originations in 2022. Commercial balances ended
at $16.1 billion as new vehicle supply remained near historic lows in the quarter.
Turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page, auto volume of $13.3 billion represents our highest
quarterly origination level since 2006. Used accounted for 69% of originations this quarter, also reflecting a high
watermark and a testament to our ability to adapt to market conditions. Our disciplined and consistent approach to
underwriting and entrenched dealer relationships have driven increased originations, while maintaining consistent
FICO and non-prime trends.
Turning to insurance results on slide 19, core pre-tax income of $14 million decreased year-over-year on the
impact of lower industry vehicle sales, dealer inventories and elevated investment gains versus prior year. The
increase in losses was primarily driven by weather claims, which were at an all-time low in the prior period. Total
written premiums of $262 million reflected lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry. We remain
focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic offerings to drive future growth in the insurance
business.
Turning to corporate finance on slide 20, core income of $60 million reflected disciplined growth in the loan
portfolio, a year-over-year decline in other revenue from elevated investment gains in the prior period, and stable
credit trends. Net financing revenue was impacted by interest rate floor on a portion of the loan portfolio, which
limited yield expansion following initial rate hikes. Given the current level of benchmark rates, we expect yields to
expand from here. The loan portfolio remains diversified across industries, with asset-based loans comprising
57% of the portfolio. Our $8.5 billion HFI portfolio is up 38% year-over-year, reflecting our expertise and
disciplined growth within a highly competitive market.
Mortgage details are on slide 21. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $6 million and $900 million of DTC
originations, reflecting tighter margins on conforming production and reduced demand from refinancing activity.
Mortgage remains a key product for our customers who value a modern and seamless digital platform. We are
prioritizing a great experience for our bank customers, an enhanced risk adjusted return, which may lead to
changing origination levels in any given quarter or year. Our partnership model ensures we avoid considerable
operational volatility seen across the industry.
I'll close by thanking our Ally teammates who remain the driving force behind our strong operating and financial
results. And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Jenn. Finally, I'll close with a few comments on slide number 22. I maintain a tremendous amount of
pride leading our company. Over many years, we've developed a purpose-driven culture, which is integral to our
financial and operational performance. Ingrained within that culture is the unwavering focus on delivering for our
teammates, customers, communities and stockholders. This broad and deeply ingrained purpose will define our
long-term success.
I'm sure you've seen various letters from CEOs to shareholders write about the power of purpose in guiding your
company and management teams. That is a message we certainly embrace inside of Ally, and part of the reason I
have the confidence that we will be able to deliver durable returns for our shareholders. I continue to challenge
our teammates to see around corners, focus on essentialism, adopting owner's mindset and live our purpose to
be an Ally for all. It's embedded in our culture and has prepared us for changing times. Ally's results this quarter
demonstrate we're equipped to successfully navigate and win in challenging environments.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Jenn, you had talked a little bit about the pricing actions that you've taken so far. Can you talk a
little bit about, like how far that can go, and at what point do you think the impact on the monthly payment will kind
of limit the ability to take price? So can you just talk about that a little? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Moshe. Maybe some pricing comments on the asset side, and then I'll go
over to the liability side. But on the asset side, Moshe, we have been really pleased with not only the flow we've
been able to originate, but the pricing actions we've taken, which I mentioned is about 150 basis points. And
through the second quarter, we're looking at kind of close to a 90% beta relative to fed funds in retail auto pricing.
Now, going forward, we got to be measured in terms of our ability to continue at that pace. I think if you look at
last cycle, it's more like a 50% beta. So somewhere in the middle there, we'll be opportunistic. We love the flows
we're seeing, the returns we're seeing, and we'll continue to put price in. But we've been at a 90% beta probably
will fluctuate a little bit as we move ahead, especially as we're anticipating another eight hikes in the forwards.

And I'd also comment, it's not just retail auto. We see a lot of opportunities to continue to see yield expansion. We
are growing our unsecured portfolios, Ally Lending, Credit Card, we see really robust originated yields in the low
teens for Ally Lending and the upper teens for Credit Card, and we're growing those very quickly. You can see a
path kind of at a $4 billion to $6 billion in those portfolios. Corporate finance continues to grow. We hit a high
watermark at $8.5 billion, and HFI this quarter continuing to see a clear path to about $10 billion and yields
expanded from there. And then, last but not least, we've been really, I think, thoughtful around our investment
securities portfolio, managing duration in the book, also putting hedges. We have about $20 billion notional
against retail auto, and that takes about a quarter of our retail auto portfolio and flips it to floating in a rising rate
environment.
So yeah, Moshe on the asset side which is a very powerful driver of NII and NIM, we continue to see just robust
growth, robust ability to put pricing and yields on the books. And I'll just make note that we had a $15 billion
increase in loans on a year-over-year basis. It's the highest loan growth we've ever seen with really great pricing
momentum. And then on the deposit side I'd say, Moshe, things have materialized as expected. I think we're
really pleased with the positioning. We're up 85% deposits funded. We've had about a 33% pricing beta relative to
fed funds. We could see that accelerate a bit from here. But we've got access to diverse and efficient funding
sources. We put on about $6.5 billion of term funding at – locked in some duration at great rates. So we feel really
good about both sides of balance sheet. And Moshe, we really see that we can generate that upper 3% NIM as
we head into the medium term.

basis points above CECL day 1 and up 2 basis points in the second quarter. How should we think about the pace
of reserving, and what should we – or that level of the reserve relative to retail auto loans as we go through the
rest of 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. And let me just hit on what I think most parts at least are picking up across the media and the outlets
this morning. I mean, look, we had incredibly robust retail auto originations this quarter. The highest levels that
we've had since 2006, and the vast majority of the increase in our reserving this quarter is a result of loan growth,
and it's accretive loan growth, serving our customers, positioning us well to drive accretive returns over time to
generate that 16-plus to 18-plus percent ROTCE that we guide to. And so we are kind of unapologetic about a
reserve build this quarter.
And the vast majority of that, again, was retail auto growth, as well as growth in some of our other newer
products. And Moesha, from there, we'll see reserves bounce around a couple of basis point. I mean, as you're
pointing out, we're up 2 basis points on coverage rates. A lot of that's just seasoning of the portfolio, timing of
when originations flow on and the portfolio flows off, especially the post COVID portfolio vintages. But we see
pretty, likely stable from here, could migrate down more towards that day 1 seasonal level over time, but we're not
in a hurry to do that, especially considering some of the uncertainty on the horizon relative to macros.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess, I have two questions. One is, as you're thinking about the medium term for NIM, I know you mentioned in
the high 3s, could you just give us a sense as – or in the upper 3s, I think is the words to used, could you just give
us a sense as to upper 3s, is that like 3.5 plus or is that 3.7 plus? And I know it's – maybe you don't want to be
that specific on the call, but it's just a bit of a debate out there what upper means to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, let me jump in on this. Betsy, as we think about the long-term earnings power of the
company, look, we delivered over 4% this quarter. Could we see that coming down a bit to kind of 3.7 plus in the
medium term? Yeah. And then in between now and the medium term, it could bounce around a bit from here,
because you know our balance sheet, we have liabilities that reprice faster than assets. We're going to see, if we
realize the forwards another 8 hikes between now and December. And so there could be some pressure on our
margin just because deposits are going to reprice faster than assets. But as I just mentioned, in response to
Moshe's call, we've got terrific momentum on the assets side that will eventually catch up to the liability side. It's
just a matter of timing as we go between now and kind of the tightening cycle, but feel really confident medium
term around that 3.7-plus percent number with things moving around a bit here just relative to the forwards.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then could you just give us a little more color on the comments that you had around the delinquencies? When
you were on page 12, I think, you mentioned that you had taken some actions or recognized some parts of the
portfolio differently maybe than you had in prior quarters. So maybe you could give us a sense as to what drove
that delinquencies up. And if you could speak to what your expectation is as you look out over the next six to 12
months, how you see that trajecting either seasonally or structurally, because the financial slide was removed, the
financial outlook slide was removed from this deck, and there's been some questions on how you're thinking
about the delinquencies in the NCOs there. Thanks.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2022
Yeah. Sure. So first on the delinquencies, NCOs were meant to the guide. So on delinquencies, look, you're
seeing some normalization flow through both the 30-day and the 60-day is all within our expectations. I did
mention in the 60-day, look, we're always investing in new strategies and new approaches to help our customers,
keep our customers in their car as longer. So I made note of one of those around repossession timing, which is
essentially just giving our customers a little bit more time to pay. We've had tremendous success with that
approach, and that just keeps that 60-day number up temporarily as we're rolling through this new policy. But it's
normalization of the portfolio, as expected. There are some seasonality in there from a delinquency perspective
and then some policy changes that are driving that growth.
What I would say, relative to NCOs is, we're still performing relative to the guide that we provided last quarter.
And quite frankly, we didn't include the outlook slide because nothing really has changed, Betsy. So under 1%,
this year migrating slowly back up to that 1.4% to 1.6% by 2024, I mentioned the NIM guide still intact, and we still
see a trajectory to that 16 to 18-plus-percent ROTCE. And I'll note this time, it's ex-OCI. So hopefully there's no
confusion on that front, which with continued really strong performance here in 2022, JB mentioned we printed
19% ROTCE, ex-OCI, we'll be kind of in that range for full year 2022 as well. So I just want to be really clear. We
didn't put the financial outlook slide in simply because of longer term, medium term guide every single quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the clarification there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Absolutely. Thank you, Betsy, for the questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to a question Moshe asked about, that the re-pricing of the loans and
sort of when you might see more stress for the consumer to make those payments or demand erosion. I mean, if
we go back in time, can you just talk about when you hit up against these pricing levels and sort of what the
impact might have been?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So we have not traditionally seen increases in interest rates impact demand. And I would say
that, this cycle is very similar to what we've seen in the past, and if anything, providing additional tailwind simply
because supply has been constrained. We continue to estimate 4 million to 5 million consumers on the sidelines
simply because they cannot find a vehicle to purchase. And you couple that demand with our model that has
consistently grown dealer relationships, dealer engagement, and in a period where you see a 19% reduction in
sales units, we're generating a 3% increase in application flow. So strong demand, a model that continues to win
across prime and in particular prime used, and we really don't see this slowing down.
I mean, keep in mind, a 100-basis point increase in pricing for a car loan is $15 to $20 a month. And according to
some data this week, that's kind of two loaves of bread these days. So we're not seeing a lot of price sensitivity
just from the car interest rates. And in particular, I'd say, in the more affluent segments, and if you look at page 7

that I provided this morning, we do see really strong application flow in the higher income earners, which we've
defined as kind of over $50,000. And our average in terms of income of our customers that we're originating with
is over $100,000. So in that segment, with the supply constraints and with our model, we really don't see this
slowing down, and we don't see a lot of price sensitivity for the interest rates, nor do we even for the car, which is
materially higher these days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
So hopefully, that gives you some color, Sanjay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, that's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up question on the originations, that was a really strong
number. I'm just curious, how much of that is being driven by units versus share gains versus inflation? Maybe
you could just touch on like LTVs and sort of the migration of LTVs as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, look, Sanjay, we are seeing really strong unit application flow. But as we've come through
COVID, definitely the price per unit is driving the strong flows. And so I've guided towards kind of $45 billion plus
in terms of retail flow this year. We would still see really strong originations as contract values potentially come
down with used vehicle values. You know we've modeled a 3% reduction in used vehicle values, but that simply
will be replaced by a shift to more units. So we don't see the overall number changing, although we could see
higher units driving net flows as we head into 2023 and beyond. To be determined, we've modeled used vehicle
pricing coming down. But I think there's a lot of dynamics around the supply chain that could suggest that it stays
elevated for longer.
And then on LTV, it's been interesting, we don't actually see an overall change in the LTV. Just as you look at the
dynamics between new and used, so not changing very materially at all. I think on severity, we're monitoring that
very closely. We've modeled into our NCO rate simply the fact that used vehicle values do come down about
30%. But again, I think there's potentially some upside against that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
JB, maybe a bigger picture question for you. Jenn highlighted numerous times the robust growth you saw. I think
Jenn said best growth since 2006. Markets are obviously flashing a bit of yellow lights right now. And we've heard
commentary from others regarding competitive forces in auto intensifying. So just want to get a better sense for
how you're thinking about growth at this point in the cycle, and maybe any tweaks that you're making to
underwriting at this point just given what's happened with the pricing of vehicles.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Correct. Ryan, thanks for the question. So we hear and we see the yellow lights flashing too. And we do
think the overall industry is tightening and competitive pressures are intensifying. So we would definitely agree
with those statements. But I think it comes back to a little bit the power of the model that we built, the relationships
that we've established. So I mean, I don't think you can overstate the importance of growth in the dealer count,
which is now 22,400-ish dealers. That's up 20% over the past several years. And then also just the relationships
we've established with big players and new players like EchoPark, Carvana and others, and while there's
questions around their models, we're still seeing really strong flows from them in really high quality paper. And so
for us, we have not at all changed underwriting standards. I think, our FICO chart or FICO analysis is pretty boring
through time. It really hasn't changed.
Jenn, just talked about LTV, we really haven't seen that change. DTI, credit quality of the book remains really well
intact. Obviously, the question, Jenn and I, when we sit down with our auto teams and our credit partners and our
CRO debate is around this outer look on severity, if you get a meaningful decline in used car prices, does that
expose us. Again, you don't see speculation in auto lending. And we think, to Jenn's point, you priced in all that
risk already in our assumptions around used car. So for us it's back to, you take care of your customers, you
serve them very well, and it provides nice rewards in terms of just seeing really strong flows. I'd also look at other
stats around what are we seeing, are we seeing any changes in auto decisioning or not. So right now credit
underwriting remains disciplined. I think the reason we're winning is we're just getting a bigger look. We make it
easy for dealers, and so the flows are really strong, obviously I appreciated Sanjay's comments a minute ago
about how strong of a quarter it was.
And again, whilst we may flash a miss on EPS, I think, Jenn and I would take that all day long because we put on
really, really accretive high quality loan growth, that 3 times going to contribute meaningfully to earnings. And
again back to, looking at this paper, 7.8% for this quarter, Jenn talked about 8% plus. I remember Ryan, when we
sat down at your conference in December, and kind of one of the questions you posed to me was the rising rate
outlook, and we talked around auto loans being able to achieve an 8% type of yield, while you're seeing it now.
And so I think, a lot of really positive dynamics, and we would not want anyone to have a take away that we've
altered credit appetite up or down to achieve this. It's just really strong relationships, working well with your dealer
partners. So we're really proud of the results this quarter, Ryan.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe just one final from me, and I appreciate you remembering our conversation. Jenn, maybe just the
outlook for funding and balance sheet dynamics. I think you said that you expect retail deposit growth for the rest
of the year, and I think you highlighted – you saw growth in the month of June. Just how do you think about the
level of growth in deposits from here? And maybe just help us think about the notion of growing deposits versus
lending securities shrink versus further tapping wholesale funding. How do you think about using each of those as
a lever to fund the balance sheet? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. And you're spot on, you were listening well, Ryan. We are expecting full year retail deposit growth,
and we've been pleased so far with June results, which have been solid. And as I mentioned in my prepared
remarks, as you see that price gap widen between the direct banks and the traditional banks, we tend to see
outsized flows into the direct banks and in particular to Ally. So we're confident in the growth from here. I think, in
addition to that, especially as we're investment grade rated at this point, we do have options to tap into alternative
funding sources. We did about $6.5 billion of term funding this quarter, locked in some duration around two-and-a-
half years at incredibly low rate.
So we're really pleased with some of the brokered CDs we've put on the books, FHLB. We had some modest
unsecured and secured issuances as well, and we'll just continue to be opportunistic as we think about alternative
funding sources, but we feel really good about the liability stack, the strength of our businesses, the pricing that
we've had to date has been very much in line with expectations. And we'll just navigate the future the same way
we have done in the past and us continuing to focus on strong value for our customers and continuing to be
opportunistic or broad across a broad diversified set of funding alternatives.

Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Both you guys have referred to assuming lower used car prices. I mean, maybe can you detail like what kind of
cadence you're expecting, and what type of overall trends there? And then just, I guess, the second follow on
question is, how does that affect the lease margin over the next several quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, John. Let me just talk about what we've modeled and then what we're seeing in reality. And
consistent with prior quarters, we are modeling a 30% point-to-point reduction, linearly in used vehicle values from
the end of 2021 to 2023. So it's a precipitous drop. We've done that just to be mindful of the environment. We
know used vehicle values are elevated, and we wanted to be just very prudent in how we modeled our medium
term outlook. So that's what we've modeled in there. Certainly, as you'd see used vehicle pricing come down,
you'll see some pressure on gains. Some of that, as I've mentioned several times, could be slightly offset by LBO
and DBO dynamics. But all things considered, you might see used vehicle value gains and yields come down a
tad from there.
I mean, of course, there's also increases from rates there, but there could be some modeled pressure on lease
yields. What we're seeing in reality is very different. Yields and used vehicle pricing has remained robust heading
into 2022. And as all of the dynamics that we've been talking around, strong consumer, strong demand
continuing, especially at the intersection of prime and used. We don't see that slowing down from a demand
perspective and supply continues to be challenged. We continue to see OEMs' inventory levels kind of bouncing
around the bottom of 20-day supply, and they've historically run, 60, 80-day supply plus. So favorable supply and
demand dynamics could support used vehicle values to outperform our model. So hopefully that gives you some
color, John.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jul-2022
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Rob, look, we're really pleased with flows that we're seeing so far in June. We're mindful that we're six
hikes into a potential 14 hike year here. So I think, as we've noted in the past, we'll continue to lag rate as the fed
fund rate increases, and we don't need to be a leader across the industry. But look, we're moving into a rapidly
rising fed funds tightening cycle. And so you could see some additional increases in pricing on the deposit side.
But as I've mentioned, I think we're really well-positioned from a value proposition perspective with our customers,
as well as the fact that we're 85% deposit funded, and we have access to alternative funding sources. So we're
feeling good about our position. We're mindful of this kind of unprecedented increase in Fed funds ahead of us,
but know that we can continue to navigate with confidence and continue to win. And as I mentioned, we're really
pleased with June flows, and expecting full year deposit growth this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Thanks. And you also talked about putting on some more short term borrowings in the quarter. Can you just talk
about how you expect that to factor into the funding mix going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer A. LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we're going to continue to do more of it opportunistically. I mean, you saw us add on that FHLB
even in the fourth quarter 2021, continue to add on that FHLB in first and second quarters of 2022. We've had
secured and unsecured issuances. And I think you'll see all of that going forward on an opportunistic basis. And
we look at everything in terms of pricing, in terms of investor opportunities, the market. So we don't have any hard
and fast numbers, but we're going to continue to leverage diverse funding sources as we move forward.
