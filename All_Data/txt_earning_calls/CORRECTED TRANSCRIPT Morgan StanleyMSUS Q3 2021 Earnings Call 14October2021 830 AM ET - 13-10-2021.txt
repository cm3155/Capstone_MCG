Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It was an exceptional third quarter the firm delivered,
and it's contributed to year-to-date revenues of $45 billion. To put this in context, year-to-date revenues
surpassed full year 2019 revenues by nearly 10% as of this stage.
Our business model continues to generate durable revenues, high returns, and strong operating leverage, and we
produced an ROTCE of over 20% both in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Institutional Securities continues to gain share. It performed strongly across all regions and all three major
businesses. The work we have done to integrate our businesses across Investment Banking is clearly paying
dividends. Of note, Investment Banking had its best quarter in history, and within that, M&A also produced its own
record quarter. Equities are extremely strong and fixed income was stable.
The Wealth Management business, which includes E*TRADE now, of course, is growing assets at levels far
beyond what we've seen. Through the first nine months, this business added over $300 billion of net new assets,
compounding growth on a client asset base of over $4.6 trillion. And we believe this is going to be an economic
engine for Morgan Stanley for decades to come.
The majority of our advisors had positive net new assets year-to-date, and it's this broad-based strength that's key
to driving these asset levels. We're seeing momentum, though, across all our newer channels, self-directed and
workplace. Self-directed client engagement remains elevated. US corporate stock plan wins increased over 90%
versus last year.
In the quarter, we continued to broaden our reach, especially through Morgan Stanley at Work, where we now
have in excess of 14 million unique relationships. While it's early days, we believe that over time, Morgan Stanley
at Work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business, providing additional connectivity to a wider
range of prospective clients for broader Wealth Management services.
In Investment Management, fee-based asset management revenues were $1.5 billion in the quarter. By the way,
that's nearly triple the average quarterly level of five years ago. Our $1.5 trillion of assets under management
represents a more diverse asset mix, further enhancing the range of value we can provide clients. Expanded
solutions and customization, sustainability, and value-added fixed income, along with our sizable and growing
alternatives platform, position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends. Year-to-date, net flows
within Investment Management have exceeded $100 billion.
Finally, as it relates to capital, we bought back $3.6 billion of stock, consistent with our overall capital plan, and
doubled our dividend, thereby delivering shareholders nearly 3% return.
All that said, we're not complacent, and while there's obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment, we
do expect the Federal Reserve will begin tapering soon and that will be followed by increasing rates in 2022. We
remain optimistic about the firm's position and business outlook, but we'll exercise more caution if we see a
significant uptick in volatility. Throughout, we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and
ensure we do business the right way.
A final word on capital. As you know, SA-CCR, the standardized counterparty credit risk (sic) [standardized
approach for counterparty credit risk] regulatory change is beginning next year for the largest banks. It impacts
the calculation of counterparty credit risk and, thus, risk-weighted assets. We've decided to early adopt in the
fourth quarter. That, of course, increases RWAs, and with that, lowers the implied CET1 ratio. Our current CET1
ratio, which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of the third quarter, is 16%.
The pro forma impact of SA-CCR, absent further mitigation, could theoretically reduce that by approximately 120
basis points.
Of course, we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate, and that work has already begun. But early adoption allows us to
pick up a benefit in future CCAR tests which may itself offset a part of this impact over time.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
I'm now going to turn the call over to Sharon and she will discuss the quarter in greater detail, and then we'll both
take your questions. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the third quarter, once again
representing one of the top three quarters of the last decade. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS
was $2.04 and our ROTCE was 20.2%.
Year-to-date revenues reached a record of $45.2 billion. Institutional Securities continues to power performance,
with particular strength in Investment Banking and Equities. Wealth Management and Investment Management
each set year-to-date records. While investing for growth, our business model demonstrated operating leverage.
The firm's year-to-date efficiency ratio improved to 67%.
Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with $7.5 billion in revenues.
Year-to-date, the revenues of $23.2 billion were the strongest in over a decade. The integrated Investment Bank
is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share. Balanced revenues supported overall results.
Advisory in particular was a standout, with record quarterly and year-to-date performance. Importantly,
Institutional Securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage. The pre-tax margin, which was 38% year-to-
date, has significantly contributed to the firm's strong efficiency ratio this year.
Investment Banking revenues were a record of $2.8 billion, increasing 67% from the prior year. Exceptional
performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarter's results. The Americas and
Europe led the year-over-year increase. Advisory revenues were a record $1.3 billion, reflecting increased
completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Results were supported by greater sector diversification compared
to last year.
Equity underwriting revenues were $1 billion marking the fourth consecutive quarter at or above this level. The
increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products. Fixed income underwriting revenues were
$567 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in non-investment grade loans supported by the
combination of the rate environment and elevated levels of event-driven activity.
Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions, and activity is expected to continue on
the back of current momentum. Financial sponsors are deploying capital and corporate clients are looking for
strategic opportunities as a source for growth.
Equity revenues were very strong, increasing 24% from the prior year to $2.9 billion. Our Equities business
remains a global leader. Results benefited from sustained client activity throughout the quarter. Revenues in Asia
were particularly strong, underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint.
Cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year. Broad-based client engagement continued
through the summer months. Prime brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market
levels.
Fixed income revenues declined from the strong prior year to $1.6 billion. Still, the business delivered a solid third
quarter. Micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues in securitized products
and credit corporates compared to the prior year which benefited from wider bid/offer spreads. Macro also

declined versus last year with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange. Commodities was strong and
revenues improved versus the prior year as North America power and gas benefited from robust client activity.
Turning to Wealth Management, the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period
given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were $5.9 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter. However,
excluding the impact of DCP, which declined by approximately $300 million, the revenues increased 2%.
Integration-related costs were $113 million. Excluding integration-related expenses, PBT was $1.6 billion, and the
margin was 27.7%. We realized a record of $135 billion of net new assets which underscores the power of the
asset-gathering platform we have built. Net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced inclusive of
assets from existing clients and new clients, stock plan vesting events, and net recruiting. Year-to-date NNA
exceeds $300 billion, representing a 10% annualized growth rate of beginning-period assets.
In the quarter, we added $43 billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition. These
incremental assets are reflected in total client assets, fee-based assets, net new assets, and fee-based flows. We
are particularly excited about the approximately 600,000 participants associated with these retirement assets who
will now have access to educational content and analytical tools delivered through the Financial Wellness
platform. Deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to advisor-led or self-
directed clients based on their individual needs is at the core of our expansion strategy.
The workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel that will fuel our growth over time. We are excited by
the momentum in the workplace. Year-to-date, new stock plan participants have more than doubled. We have
nearly $500 billion in unvested assets.
In the quarter, transactional revenues were $832 million. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 4%, in
line with seasonal patterns. Self-directed daily average tradings were approximately 960,000 in the quarter, in line
with the average level for the full year of 2020. While moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier
this year, client engagement remains high. DARTs this quarter were three times above E*TRADE's pre-
acquisition record.
Asset Management revenues were $3.6 billion, up 5% sequentially. Year-to-date, these revenues increased 29%
to a record $10.3 billion. The strength in fee-based flows supports our view that clients first consolidate assets
under our platform and then migrate these assets to advisory.
Bank lending balances grew $7 billion sequentially to $121 billion and have grown 23% year-to-date. Growth in
securities-based lending and mortgages drove the increase, reflecting strong client demand for new lines and
increased household participation.
Net interest income was $1.3 billion. Prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter but it did impact the
sequential move. Excluding for prepay for both quarters, NII was up 4%, benefiting from the incremental growth in
lending balances and decreased deposit costs. For the remainder of the year, we expect NII to build sequentially
on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter.
The integration of E*TRADE remains on track. Today, dual clients of E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley can choose
to provide their Morgan Stanley advisor with visibility into their E*TRADE accounts. By year end, clients will be
able to link their self-directed accounts via single sign-on, building on our digital client experience.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Moving to Investment Management, the timing of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more
relevant benchmark. Revenues were $1.5 billion, declining 15%, while Asset Management and related fees rose
sequentially, the increase was offset by lower performance-based income and other revenue.
Total AUM remains strong at $1.5 trillion. Total net flows were $12.3 billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and
overlay services. Long-term flows reflected a single redemption of $7.5 billion in our Solutions business by a large
asset manager. The redemption was approximately half of the asset manager's AUM with us, and we expect the
remainder of the AUM to be redeemed in the first half of 2022 as the asset manager brings its equity trading
implementation in-house. Excluding this idiosyncratic outflow, we saw positive long-term net flows with continued
demand for Parametric customized portfolios, private real estate, and private credit, and sustainable strategies
through both Calvert and MSIM funds.
Asset Management and related fees were $1.5 billion, reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring
revenues in this business. Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $17 million in the
quarter. Gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our Asia private equities
business primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds. The broadening of our
growing alternatives portfolio helps mitigate this overall impact.
Finally, the integration with Eaton Vance remains on pace. We continue to invest in secular growth areas,
particularly sustainability, alternatives, and customization for Wealth Management platforms and clients.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets increased to $1.2 trillion. Risk-weighted assets grew by
approximately $11 billion, primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter. We continue to deliver on our
commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our $12 billion buyback authorization, buying
back $3.6 billion of stock in the quarter.
Our standardized CET1 ratio now stands at 16%. As James mentioned, we intend to early adopt SA-CCR during
the fourth quarter this year after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics such as
the future SCB calculations. With our current portfolio size and mix, the adoption would imply an estimated
increase to our risk-weighted assets of approximately $35 billion to $45 billion. This would also imply a reduction
to our CET1 ratio by approximately 120 basis points upon adoption. We have commenced mitigation efforts which
should offset some of the impacts to our CET1 ratio. We will continue to remain well capitalized post the adoption
of SA-CCR.
We continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise. The firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the
end of the year on a strong footing. We are capturing share in Institutional Securities. Clients remain engaged and
pipelines are healthy. We are excited by the momentum we see in Wealth Management's ability to attract and
consolidate assets and the benefits of the improved diversification in Investment Management. Importantly, we
are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses.
With that, we will now open the line up to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with
Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. I'm curious, the flows in the Wealth Management channel continue to impress. I think you
guys are, by far, the largest distributor of alternative assets. And as that space grows and as that becomes a
bigger part of client portfolio, I wonder if you could help us frame, have you ever broken out either the asset level
or percentage of high net worth portfolios that you have today versus where you think that can grow to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think – hi, Glenn, it's Sharon. I think, if memory serves me, there was a strategy deck that we did in 2017 or 2018
that does give a portfolio mix that you can see for advisory-led assets. So, it can give you some sense – rough
sense from those documents. What I would say, though, that I had also noticed this trend. When we go through it,
there has been a slight shift. But you're obviously talking about a very large asset base. But I would definitely say
that both anecdotally, and it does bear out in some of the numbers, that you see a slight increase towards
alternatives as a composition of the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up on your SA-CCR comments, because they were reasonably comprehensive.
Which specific assets are most impacted, just so I can think through mitigation and how much of an impact it can
make? And then, I'm curious, what does early adoption do for you besides like brownie points. Like, how does
that possibly help in future CCARs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah – and Glenn, in case you're confused, this is James. The accents are so different. On SA-CCR, I mean, it
affects counterparty credit risks. There were models that were in place that Basel has been working on replacing
actually starting 2014, and the idea was to implement it in 2017. And they relate to most of the derivative
contracts and the determination where their margin and op margin, how to treat that from a risk-weighted asset
perspective.
So, there's a complicated formula that applies a weighting to default risk and then the NPV of future payment
obligations under various contracts. So, it's taken a while for them to get it done. They actually deferred it, I think,
during COVID. They've given the banks till the beginning of next year to put it in place, and they're allowing banks
to preannounce. The benefit of starting early is it affects the peak to trough in your CCAR calculations during the
CCAR cycle, so there will be some offsets later, and we just felt we needed to get into it sooner rather than later.
Most of it is in ISG. I think about – if, let's say, the RWA number, I think, we've got at $35 billion to $45 billion.
Honestly, that's moving around a little bit because this is complicated stuff. But we certainly don't think it's worse,

and hopefully it's the lower end of that. Some of it is in the Wealth business because of all the options in that
business. But it's a relatively small part of it, I think like 10%, 15%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to start on net new assets in Wealth. Sharon, I believe you
flagged an acquisition of a retirement business. Number one, like this is basically just a team, right, of consultants
that will sit within Wealth, so it could be, call it, a large-scale recruiting. Is that fair?
And number two, is the idea that you guys are interested in getting, more importantly and more sort of
strategically, is the idea that you guys want to get a little bit more aggressive in 401(k) DC plans in order to
complement the stock plan business and enhance the workplace offering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So I'd say holistically, Brennan – nice to speak to you – it's fair. I think that it is a large-scale team that you can
consider in terms of that asset acquisition. I think that as you rightly point out, it is an extension of our strategy.
And what you're really trying to think about is how do you get more participants that you can touch, that you can
begin to sell both products and assets that are appropriate for them, but more than that, offer them true services
like financial wellness that we're already doing through the stock plan business.
So if you think of retirement assets and then you think of who's the actual holder of those retirement assets, and
those are the participants through municipalities, pensions, et cetera, then all of a sudden you have just another
layer of people that you first offer financial wellness and education to and then you can introduce them to the
services that Morgan Stanley has, the same way that you would introduce the services to a workplace client. So
an extension of a strategy and a continuation of the concept of the funnel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
My key takeaway on – because this is a very important topic, broadly, my key takeaway on it is we used to have a
very monolithic model for asset gathering. You had existing clients who maybe brought new money to you from
other institutions or accumulated wealth. They also spent wealth, so that would go up and down. You had
financial advisors who left and who you recruited. And for many years, we were, frankly, net deficit of financial
advisors as were, frankly, most of the broker-dealers in my 30 years of doing this.
A couple of years ago, the net deficit changed materially for us. We are seeing net positive attrition, very few
advisors leaving, and significant advisors coming, particularly large teams from across the street in the banking
industry. So that's a positive.
The channel that the workplace has opened up and the opportunity to gather assets, which was a part of the
driver between – behind this quarter's numbers, is basically a new channel. And then obviously, the E*TRADE
channel is a new channel. And now you're seeing the sort of acquisition of RIA-type teams, of which this is one.

So it's gone from sort of a one model, a defense and attack model of keep your people and try and get some of
the marketplace, to a multi-pronged model, which if we – obviously, we can't predict the future, but it looks like this
is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead, which is the strategy.

Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So sticking along that same topic of just the corporate stock plan business, it looks like the organic growth
continues to sustain really strong momentum in terms of new corporate stock plan adds. And I was just curious
how client conversion levels are tracking today within your ecosystem relative to the levels you were seeing prior
to the E*TRADE deal, and was hoping you can just provide a broader update, not just on the corporate stock plan
momentum but even just how you're tracking with the revenue synergy targets from E*TRADE since you
announced the deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. It's nice to speak to you, Steve. So I would just echo what you said. Yes, we saw US stock plan wins
increase 90% over last year, so just to put that out there and put it in perspective. As you think about conversion,
we're still working through some of the metrics as it relates to retention, but anecdotally, we are seeing strong
retention. Obviously there were different metrics as you think about what E*TRADE defined as retention and how
you might define retention going forward given this new structure, but I think that the synergies as they've played
out are very strong.
We obviously never gave a direct revenue target, but if you think about what E*TRADE was doing, it's – the
concept was always, well, how you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth. And so we're seeing our
teams work very closely together. We're thinking about new ways to offer Morgan Stanley services like research,
et cetera, and advice that you would see through your advisor also through your E*TRADE portal. And all of that's
really much in track and on – we continue to think about meeting our companion accounts, for example, which
was 50% right now and 90% in the US account by next year. So all of those sort of touch points and milestones,
we're on track and we look forward to giving you, I think, more detail as you think about the January deck next
year.

Yes. Hi. Good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki on from Matt's team. Thanks for taking my question.
So my question relates to the Investment Banking backdrop and how it relates to direct listings. So Investment
Banking results are very strong, and as you previously noted, pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions
and momentum should continue.
So with that said, there's been a number of direct listings this year versus just one in 2018. Given Morgan Stanley
has been an advisor on a number of these deals, could you share your observations if the increase of these
private to public structures, although small in numbers still, have been more of a by-product of a favorable market
backdrop, or is it more of a structural change in the private markets, and any comments you could share on future
industry pipelines for direct listings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I think that the key point that we've always said about direct listings is that it's another tool in the tool kit and
it's really dependent on a client situation and the needs at that point in time. So these are specific situations. But I
would say that that, while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results, what I would focus you on for
advisory are two things. One is the diversification across the sectors and the geography. So what we're seeing is
not just one product necessarily driving results or one sector driving results but rather that the pipelines, broadly,
are healthy, and as James said last year, we continue to invest in this business. So I think that's sort of how we
think about the business going forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Sharon, James. Can you guys share with us – obviously, the markets have been very
strong. You guys have done a great job obviously in capturing that growth along with some of your peers. Do you
have any sense what normalization would be in the markets and how you would – what kind of market share you
could maintain in a more normalized market, whether that's somewhere between 2019 and today? But any color
there?
And then second, James, you talked about increased volatility. What are some of the metrics you're looking at to
measure if the markets became more volatile and you guys would maybe get a little more defensive? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, on the normalized markets, it's clearly been a major shift between the US and non-US institutions, post-
crisis. And I'm talking about capital markets here, Gerard. The barriers to entry for those businesses, if you look at
a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that try to be global investment banks and didn't work out so
well, the scale economics of it, the barriers to entry are just so large. And frankly, the technology is so demanding
and complex that it's pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is
dominating sort of the global flow of capital markets. And within that, we're obviously performing very well. We've
picked up a lot of share consistently across fixed income and equities and, increasingly, in banking over the last
several years. I don't see that abating. I mean, I don't see a compelling reason why that would change.
In the wealth and asset management space, again, scale is your friend. We've done two huge deals in the last
year, and then Smith Barney a decade ago, at $6.5-ish trillion, clearly, at scale, we're one of the biggest asset

managers and wealth managers in the world, and that generates about $30 billion in revenue. Again, it's hard to
pick up advisors one-by-one and there aren't that many firms out there of size that really move the needle on
scale, and there aren't really any direct firms of size. You saw the Schwab-Ameritrade deal which combined two
competitors. You've got Fidelity. You've got a couple of smaller ones, but E*TRADE was kind of the last big one
that was available.
So, I'm pretty confident about our market position. I don't see why it would deteriorate at this point. Doesn't mean
it can't, but that would be more internal what we've done to ourselves than external what the market is going to do
to us, is my gut on that.
On volatility, I mean, you're looking at all sorts of stuff. You're looking at the day-to-day movements in market
prices. You're looking at when the Fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is. What they start signaling
in terms of how many dots suggest there will be rate increases next year. It's gone from, I think, four to nine.
That's going to introduce volatility. Some of the geopolitical discussions around, obviously, US-China
relationships, Taiwan, that injects volatility.
So, like anything, we look at sort of monetary policy, inflation numbers, geopolitics, and then see how that bleeds
into market activity. And from that, we sort of dial up or down on the margin, our risk and you're looking – you look
at specific transactions, you look at multiples of EBITDA the deals are done at, you're looking at days of
distribution on syndicated deals. I mean, there's a lot of sort of more tactical stuff, but I try and take a thematic
view. And my thematic view is it's good to be watchful right now. There's certainly nothing to suggest there are
any issues, but the markets are bouncing a little bit. And over the next 18 months, we'll see more of that as the
Fed starts to move.

Mike Mayo Q

Hey. How are you doing? Look, during the quarter, you made what seemed like a pretty significant announcement
with a partnership with Microsoft, and I'm not really sure about the ramifications of that. It looks like you're going to
use Microsoft to transition more to the public cloud, if I have that correctly. And then you're also going to be
providing services to Microsoft to help them position their business. But I wasn't really clear on that. So if you
could give – dimension that, talk about maybe efficiency benefits by using the cloud, how much do you want to
transition your workload to the cloud, and then what is it that you'd be doing in return.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Yeah, it was an important deal. Obviously, Microsoft is one of the great companies in the world, if not the largest
company in the world. So a fantastic partner for us. We did do a multiyear deal with them, I won't give you the
financials, as you would understand, but a multiyear deal with them. And by the way, they're not the only cloud
provider we use. There are great players in AWS and Google and we have relationships with all of them. But we
wanted to make a significant move. It gives us more capacity to process and analyze data. It gives us time-to-
market tools, there's more resilience and flexibility in the cloud. Obviously, some of the digital initiatives that we're
using to improve our client experience we do through the cloud. So, it's one of the pillars of our technology
strategy.
We've tried to drive more innovation across our businesses. If you look at what we've done in Wealth
Management with some of the virtual financial advisor, the LeadIQ platform, next best ideas, these kinds of
things, they're all AI-driven. And I think what you're seeing is with, first, the acquisition of Solium and then in
E*TRADE, our Wealth businesses have a much, much stronger technology backbone, and we've been driving a
lot of innovation in that space.
The cloud decision with Microsoft is really a corporate one, and I think will just lead to a much more efficient
Morgan Stanley and more resilient, by the way. But it's not solely Microsoft. We're very proud of our partnership
with them, but we're a huge company and we're going to keep evolving. We have developed a special relationship
with them on some other things that we're working on that I don't want to go into, obviously, on the call. That's
between us and Microsoft. But it's a great move, Mike. We're really happy about it.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, can you dimension what you think the potential savings are or how much workload you might move or give us
some sense? I think what we're finding is some banks, like Capital One, are 100% on the public cloud. And then
there's a series of other banks that don't really want to be on the public cloud. Where are you in that continuum?
Do you want to like have more of a private cloud, or do you want to be more on the public cloud, and what kind of
savings do you think you could get?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, I can dimension savings. Obviously, we're balancing it between both private and public. Capital One has a
very different business model. They don't do M&A. They don't underwrite equity deals. They don't have global
trading businesses. So it's a really a function of – you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to
innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies.
One of the programs Rob Rooney and the team set up several years ago is something we call our distinguished
engineers. We have some unbelievably capable engineers – software engineers, computer scientists around the
world, who work with us, and we've created a cohort where they're basically driving and feeding innovation across
the firm.
So, no, I can't break it down to a simple you go to the cloud and it will improve our efficiency ratio by 1.2%. It just
– I can't do that. But I do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities, it's making us both a
more efficient, more resilient, and faster-moving player. And frankly, being in partnership with Microsoft is a very
good thing for Morgan Stanley. They're best-in-class as a company – as a tech company.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the advisor trends. You talked about larger
advisor groups coming over, the recruiting. If you can maybe put some numbers around that in the context of kind
of maybe previous periods, year ago or something prior to that, and maybe the backlog or the outlook for advisor
growth as you think about the next kind of 12-month time period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, we don't – Dan, we don't put out numbers on actual teams that we bring in. We have a weekly report, which
I get every Friday night about 7:15, and scrutinize it pretty closely. And it shows which people we've recruited,
what their trailing 12-months revenue are, what their assets are, and then which ones we lose to different
competition and what the sources are, where they're going to. And as I said, I've been doing this a long time and
at my previous firm and here, for most of that period, we were net deficit. We were losing advisors to RIAs who
were moving sometimes to private banks. You're losing some of the smaller producers to places like Linsco
Private Ledger. That has all turned.
And I think the power of the brand, I mean, if you're – the beauty of having this integrated investment bank
combined with this Wealth and Asset Management business is you've now got world-class Parametric, Calvert
sustainability funds to offer our advisors, world-class op platform through infrastructure, mezz finance, private
equity, real estate. But you've also got new issuance. I mean, we're so active in the equity markets that if you're a
world-class advisor managing – and some of our advisors have teams of – they're managing books of $20 billion
and $30 billion. I mean, they are enormous operations themselves.
So do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets
and is not a global leader in underwriting? I don't think so. So we've got a huge competitive advantage by having
such a world-class investment bank, which feeds the advisors. Plus the research which we amortize across the
cost of all the three platforms enables us to invest more in research than you do if you're just a wealth shop or
you're just an institutional shop.
So again, we don't break down individual teams, but – and it's more than anecdotal, I have the numbers obviously
in front of me – well, not literally in front of me, but in my office, and it's real. We're getting very big teams coming
in.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Great. Good morning. Want to come back to some of the comments on Investment Banking strength and
obviously the expected ongoing momentum there. It feels like a number of the areas are still actually seeing
acceleration even in the third quarter, like advisory, and so that's driving investor questions around how much of
this is structural versus just being in a great cycle.
And as we think about, I guess, Sharon, some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role,
I'm just curious like how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today relative to
maybe a few years ago, because clearly, that's an area where there's more capital and sponsors are kind of
always transacting. So just love to get some sense of how much bigger that is and whether that could continue.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. I think if you think about sponsors, but if you really think about everything, right, what's gone on is you have
cash that you've raised and debt in other parts of the market, given where the industry was at the beginning of the
pandemic, and so you have the cash that needs to be deployed, be that either from a corporate or from a
sponsor, et cetera. And as you push that through the system, people are looking for opportunities for growth,
either from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsors' lens.
So I would say that it's an active part of the business. It's not the only part of the business, though, and that's the
point that I was trying to make before when I mentioned sector diversification. So you might look at a financial
sponsor as a sector, but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer
discretionary, et cetera. All of that, that pie in terms of where it's coming from is changing. And that diversification I
think is what's helping the activity. And I think that corporations are looking for growth. And so I'd say that it's not
just one sleeve that is driving what – the results that you saw at least over the course of this quarter and the future
pipeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Sure. Okay. Appreciate that. And then just a follow-up here, Wealth Management, terrific momentum on the
lending side. As we think about the evolution here of Morgan Stanley winning a higher percentage of the overall
customers' balance sheet or their wallet, where do you guys feel like you are at the moment on the liability side
relative to kind of the potential? And then are there any other products there that could be an interesting kind of
extension or kind of a focus for growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think that it continues to be the beginning of that process. And so when you think about where we came from
and then the penetration that we've seen from the household side, the numbers are still small. And so while there
is a loan growth momentum, and we've obviously done quite well, there's technology that James mentioned, that's
also in the loan space.
So if you are an advisor and you see somebody or you receive information that they've looked – that your client
has looked at a mortgage calculator, for example, you'll get notified. You'll speak to your client about the product
that you might have. And so I think that that extension of how you use technology to service your client better and
then also just the sheer numbers, given that we became a bank later in our life cycle, provides further runway for
growth along that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I would just add, when we bought E*TRADE, they had a relatively small loan book, and that was for good reason.
I don't know if you remember, Devin, but I forget exactly what year it was, it was probably 2005, 2006 when they
had problems with this large HELOC portfolio they had. And that made them very gun shy about the lending
space.
So just our mortgage products alone has enormous capacity with the E*TRADE clients. And that's even before
you get to start to think about the stock plan clients ultimately. We just think about converting their equity grants

into accounts, that's sort of project number one. But project number two is obviously managing their full liability
side as well. So a lot of space to go.

Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soc Gén. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So crypto has been in the news lately, and I just wanted to get
your view on how you expect that space developing and your strategy and how to offer products to clients. How
do you expect to engage with clients in the crypto space?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
We're not directly trading crypto for retail clients, and there are other players who are choosing to do that. We give
access for them to buy crypto through various funds and things. But listen, I've said it publicly before and I'll say it
again, I don't think crypto is a fad. I don't think it's going to go away. I don't know what the value of Bitcoin should
or shouldn't be, but these things aren't going away and the blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very
real and powerful.
So it remains, Andrew, a working space. But for us, honestly, it's just not a huge part of the business demand
from our clients. And that may evolve and we'll evolve with it. But right now, it's certainly not what's driving our
economics one way or the other. But we're watchful of it, we're respectful, and we'll wait and see how the
regulators handle it.
