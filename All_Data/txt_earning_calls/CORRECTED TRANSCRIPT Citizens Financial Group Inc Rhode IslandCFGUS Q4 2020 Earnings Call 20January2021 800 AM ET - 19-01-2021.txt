Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full-Year
2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan and I'll be your operator for today. Currently, all participants are
in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a
reminder, this event is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kristin Silberberg
Head of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of fourth quarter and full-year results,
referencing our presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be
happy to take questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial
Banking, are also here to provide additional color.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also referenced non-GAAP financial measures so it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the Appendix.
With that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased with the
financial performance that we delivered for the fourth quarter and for the full year as we proved adaptable and
resilient given the unprecedented challenges of 2020. We continue to demonstrate the diversification and
resilience of our business model as our mortgage and capital markets businesses delivered strong fourth quarter
performance. We remain highly focused on taking care of customers with our retail branches open and our teams
working on the next round of PPP loans. We feel we're managing our risk well and we continue to make progress
on our strategic initiatives which will position us well for future growth and for franchise value.
I'll comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines, and then I'll let John take you through the details. Our
underlying Q4 EPS was $1.04. Our ROTCE was 12.9%. Both are up from a year-ago quarter. And we delivered
2% operating leverage year-on-year. Note that the full year operating leverage was 4%, and our PPNR growth
was 12%.
Q4 credit provision was $124 million versus $110 million a year ago on a pre-CECL basis as the normalization of
provision to more front book origination levels helped drive our strong returns.
On the capital front, we maintained a strong ACL ratio of 2.24% of ex-PPP loans and our CET1 ratio was 10%.
The strong capital and reserve position gives us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2021.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
We announced the $750 million share purchase authorization today, and we'll commence activity during the
quarter. We also will look to put our capital and ample liquidity position to work in finding attractive opportunities
for loan growth.
Our credit metrics all are trending favorable, with NCOs, NPAs, and criticized assets all lower in the quarter and a
further drop in customers in forbearance. We continue to allocate additional reserves to the industry segments
most affected by the pandemic and lockdowns, and we feel that our coverage overall is very strong.
With respect to our guidance for 2021, we assume a steadily improving economy and GDP growth of around 5%.
Relative to current consensus, we see slightly higher revenue, expenses and PPNR, as well as much better
performance on credit. We see NCOs at 50 to 65 basis points for 2021, which is relative to 56 basis points in
2020.
Provision will be less than charge-offs, though how big the reserve release will be is dependent on the path of
economic recovery. Big picture, we will transition to slightly lower PPNR in 2021, given our outperformance in
mortgage in 2020. But this will be more than made up for by lower credit costs as our earnings and returns
bounce back towards pre-COVID levels.
So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2020. And we feel we
are well-positioned to do well in 2021 and continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank. I'd like
to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2020. We
know we can count on you again in the new year.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter. This
was an outstanding quarter for Citizens with strong fee income, good expense discipline, improving credit and
continued steady execution against our strategic initiatives.
For the full year, we delivered record underlying PPNR, up 12% against the challenging backdrop, driven by
record fee income, up 24%, with record results across mortgage, capital markets and wealth.
We achieved the ambitious TOP 6 goal to deliver approximately $225 million of run rate expense savings,
including approximately $140 million of in-year benefits, which supported our ongoing investments in strategic
initiatives and financial performance targets. To this end, we improved our efficiency ratio over 200 basis points to
56% by delivering 4% positive operating leverage for the year.
We expect further expense benefit of approximately $205 million to $225 million in 2021, which puts the program
on track to deliver a total pre-tax run rate benefit of $400 million to $425 million by the end of 2021.
Strong loan growth of around 6% reflects increased demand in education and point-of-sale financing as well as
PPP loans. Average deposits grew even faster at 13%, a result of government stimulus impact on consumers and
commercial clients building liquidity.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
ROTCE for the full year was 7.5%, which includes a negative 5.4% impact associated with our reserve build
under CECL. Our ACL at year-end 2020 more than doubled compared with last year, but our year-end CET1 ratio
of 10% was unchanged on the year. Strong PPNR funded the ACL build, 6% loan growth and stable dividends.
And finally, our tangible book value per share was $32.72 at quarter-end, up 2% compared with a year ago.
Next, I'll refer to just a couple of slides and give you some key takeaways for the fourth quarter and then outline
our outlook for 2021 and the first quarter. We reported underlying net income of $480 million, EPS of $1.04, and
revenue of $1.7 billion. Our underlying ROTCE was 12.9%, up around 400 basis points as a result of our strong
revenue performance, expense discipline and improvements in credit as the economy recovers.
Net interest income, on slide 6, was down only 1% linked-quarter due to lower commercial loan balances and
lower NIM. However, despite the challenging rate backdrop, our margin held up well with 8 basis point decline
linked-quarter driven by a 9 basis point impact from elevated cash balances on strong deposit flows. Lower asset
yields were offset by our improved funding mix as we grew low cost deposits with DDA of 4%. And we continue to
lower interest-bearing deposit costs, down 8 basis points to 27 basis points.
Given the recent stimulus, we expect continued strong deposit flows in the first quarter. So elevated cash will
continue to impact margin in the near term. We will remain proactive in pricing down deposits and pursuing
attractive loan growth opportunities in areas like point-of-sale finance and education as well as an attractive
commercial segment.
On slides 7 and 8, we delivered solid fees results again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in and
diversify our revenue stream. Mortgage fees were down approximately 30% this quarter due to declines in
margins and volumes from exceptional levels last quarter. However, mortgage fees were nevertheless more than
double the levels from a year ago, which continues to provide good revenue diversification benefit in this low rate
environment.
Capital market fees hit record levels, up 52% linked-quarter and 33% year-on-year, driven by strong results from
M&A advisory and accelerating activity in loan syndications. Foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue
was also strong, up 30% linked-quarter with higher customer activity levels tied to increased variable rate loan
originations. We delivered positive operating leverage of 2% year-over-year and improved our efficiency ratio to
56.8% as expenses were well-controlled.
Average core loans, on slide 10, were down 1% linked-quarter, reflecting commercial payoffs and decline in line
utilization to about 32% versus a historical average of roughly 37%. This was partially offset by growth in retail
and in our education, mortgage and point-of-sale finance portfolios. Looking at year-over-year trends, core loans
were up approximately 4% due to PPP, education and mortgage.
On slide 11, deposit flows have been elevated especially in low-cost categories and our liquidity ratios remained
strong. Average deposits were up 3% linked-quarter and 16% year-over-year as consumers and small businesses
benefited from government stimulus and clients build liquidity. We are very pleased with our progress on deposit
costs, which declined 24% or 6 basis points to 19 basis points during the quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs
were down 8 basis points to 27 basis points. We continue to drive a shift towards lower cost categories with
average DDA growth of 4% on a linked-quarter basis and 42% year-over-year. We expect to drive interest-
bearing deposit costs down to the low- to mid-teens by the end of the year as we execute our deposit playbook to
manage costs down across all channels while improving our overall funding mix.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Moving on to credit on slide 12, our metrics were positive this quarter. Net charge-offs were down 9 basis points
to 61 basis points linked-quarter. This is at the lower end of our guidance given better than expected improvement
in commercial. Commercial charge-offs for this quarter primarily came from segments most impacted by COVID-
19 such as retail, casual dining and energy. Non-accrual loans decreased 20% linked-quarter with a $302 million
decrease in commercial driven by charge-offs, return to accrual and repayment activity.
In addition, our commercial criticized loans decreased 18% from $5.7 billion in 3Q to $4.6 billion in 4Q. Given the
performance of the portfolio and improvement in the macro-economic outlook, our reserves came down slightly
but remained robust ending the quarter at 2.24% excluding PPP loans compared with 2.29% at the end of the
third quarter. This primarily reflects net charge-offs exceeding reserving needs for new loan originations.
We have some detailed credit slides in the Appendix for your reference, but I'll note that our reserve coverage for
commercial excluding PPP was 2.5% at the end of the year, slightly up from the third quarter. And within that, our
coverage for identified sectors of concern increased to a prudent 8.2% at the end of the year from 7.7% at the end
of the third quarter. The benefit to reserves from an improving macro-economic backdrop offset qualitative
overlays and further built reserves on these areas of concerns.
We maintain excellent balance sheet strength as shown on slide 13 increasing our CET1 ratio from 9.8% in 3Q to
10% at the end of the year which is at the top of our target operating range. Giving positive credit trends and
capital strength, our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $750 million of common
stock beginning in first quarter 2021.
Before I move on to our outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company on
slide 15. On the consumer side, we are focused on national expansion, the Citizens Access, integrating some of
our lending businesses to further develop our national value proposition. We've recently announced the
expansion of our national Point-of-sale offering for merchants through our Citizens Pay offering and we are
continuing to add new merchants to our point-of-sale platform as we expand into new verticals. We are very
excited about an announcement expected next week with a major retailer to provide payment options for their
customers who want a transparent and predictable way to finance purchases through a fully digital experience.
In addition, we're making great strides in our digital transformation having launched our new mobile app on
Android in the fourth quarter and iOS just this month. We've seen our active mobile households increase 15%
year-over-year, and the majority of our deposit transactions continue to be executed outside the branch. In
commercial, we have built out a robust corporate finance advisory model and we continue to rank near the top of
our peers in customer satisfaction as we help our customers navigate this challenging environment.
And now, for some high-level commentary on the outlook for 2021 on slide 16. We expect NII will be down slightly
given NIM expected to be down in the high-single digits compared to 2020, which should be largely offset by loan
growth. Loans should be up mid- to high-single digits on a spot basis with acceleration in the back half of the year
with average loans of approximately 2%. Overall, interest-earning assets should be up about 1.5% to 2%. This
assumes elevated cash levels come down gradually over the course of 2021.
Fee income is expected to be down high-single digits off the record 2020 level reflecting lower mortgage banking
fees from 2020 record levels. At the same time, we expect good performance in capital markets, wealth and other
categories that were impacted by COVID-19 last year. Noninterest expense is expected to be up just 1.5% to 2%
given benefits from our TOP program, partly offset by higher volume-related expenses in mortgage and
reinvestment in strategic initiatives. We expect net charge-offs will be in the range of 50 to 65 basis points of
average loans with a meaningful reserve release through provision.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Now, let's come to the outlook for the first quarter on slide 17. We expect NII to be down slightly due to day count.
Both earning assets and NIM are expected to be broadly stable. Fee income is expected to be down high-single
digits reflecting lower mortgage banking fees as margins continue to tighten as well as seasonal impacts.
Noninterest expense is expected to be up 2% to 3% reflecting seasonality in compensation. We expect net
charge-offs to be in the range of 50 to 60 basis points of average loans. We also expect another quarter with
provision less than charge-offs based on expected loan growth levels and macroeconomic trends.
To wrap up, this was a strong quarter for Citizens and a good finish to the year as we continue to navigate
successfully through the COVID-19 crisis and demonstrate the resilience of our franchise. We are well positioned
to have another strong year in 2021.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott
Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.

Good morning.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Let's see, Bruce, for you or one of the other members of management team, just any visibility or further color you
could give onto the expectation for loan growth to accelerate later in the year? I certainly understand sort of the
expectation. But as we look at the H8, et cetera, there's just not a lot of visibility from the outside. So would be
curious to hear any thoughts that you have and kind of what gives you confidence into that trajectory?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Well, let me kind of tee it up and then I'll ask Don to talk about commercial and Brendan and talk about
consumer. But what I would say is that on the commercial side, there's a lot of cash on the sidelines with investors
with PE funds that is looking for opportunities to go to work. We're seeing M&A pipelines, we've had a record
quarter for M&A in the fourth quarter, and we see good pipelines coming into the year.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
So, I think related to kind of increased transactions and money going into the market, that should spur some
financing opportunities. So, that would probably be the big thing. The other thing is that line draws are at historic
lows. We're probably running at 32%, 33% and we historically were at 37%. We've briefly touched 50% when
everybody drew down their cash at the height of the COVID worries. So, I think as the economy picks up, we
should start to see more real investment in the economy which also gives us some expectation that the second
half could see that line utilization pull up a bit.
And then on the consumer side, we just have such a broad array of portfolios and lending opportunities, many of
which benefit from the low rate environment. So, mortgage should still continue to see heavy level of originations
and the student loan refinancing business has also been strong and we would expect to see that continue as well.
We talk about our point-of-sale financing business with Citizens Pay. We've continued to grow the customer base
and see some real opportunities for that business as well. So, I'll stop there. That's kind of the headlines. And
maybe, Don, you could talk a little deeper about commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say first thing to note is client activity is really high right now. And the conversations across the entire –
or I'd say 90% of client base are at completely different levels than they were six months ago. So, everybody was
hunkered down in their bunkers trying to build liquidity, trying to refinance their balance sheets, and that was the
theme for 2020.
I think Bruce said it correctly, I think as we get into the back end of 2021 and we begin to get some economic
recovery, which I think will happen, we think a lot of those conversations will turn into transactions. And we're
seeing really record M&A pipelines. We're seeing record capital markets pipelines right now. And we're seeing
just a ton of clients looking to take advantage of what could be a recovering economy.
And remember that the good news here is that a lot of the companies that we were worried about six months ago
now have huge cash balances on their balance sheet. So, we've moved beyond the credit concerns and now into
the opportunistic activities of individual CEOs and individual boards of how do they want to climb out of the
pandemic. And I just am seeing a very different level of confidence everywhere except for very small business,
which I hope the stimulus package will begin to build that confidence in the smaller companies, too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Great. Brendan, how about consumer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Sure. I guess I'll just start on a quick point on credit. We continue to have confidence that the health of the
consumer is relatively strong. And while we're not out of the woods, all indicators suggests strength, which gives
us confidence to lend money into the economy. Our forbearance levels are as low as they've been, which has
probably dominated by a mortgage where we have great CLTV coverage and our delinquency rates are the
lowest they've been in quite some time. So, you put that together, it gives us from a banking perspective
confidence that the consumer area is a safe place to stimulate growth.
Just hitting on a couple of the assets, Bruce mentioned mortgage. We expect a run up in originations next year.
As John pointed out, margins will come down but we'll see some balance sheet growth as we project the

mortgage markets to potentially hit around $3.5 trillion, which is a bit up year-over-year, which is very strong.
Student loan refinancing, a lot like mortgage, in a down rate environment has a little bit of a boomlet. So our
normalized quarterly originations for student loan refi was about $350 million prior to rates ticking down. In Q4, we
hit $811 million.
So we continue to see a very strong uptick in demand there which, by the way, there's an incredibly strong
customer for the future of this franchise, a young 30s high credit profile customer that we've got a lot of
aspirations to grow the rest of the bank.
Point-of-sale in 2020, the non-Apple part of the portfolio basically tripled in its size with all the new partners that
we've brought onboard. And we continue to expect that to be the case with strong growth in 2021. And lastly, I'd
just say, our auto business has printed some of the highest returns we've seen in quite some time through the
back half of this year. And while we still think that we are in a reasonably good spot for concentration long-term
and want to moderate the growth in auto, we opportunistically, given the cash that we have on hand, see some
opportunities for very moderate growth in auto to suck up some of the excess cash that we have on hand with a
very short duration asset that will burn off pretty quickly. So, all in all, we're pretty confident in the ability to drive
pretty substantial consumer growth next year.

Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
There's obviously been very strong deposit growth for the industry including at Citizens, but do you have any
sense of how much of that might be sticky kind of longer-term here? Obviously, you've invested in the treasury
management business, which arguably has brought in some deposits. But how do you frame kind of what might
be sticky versus what will leave when central banks start to unwind a bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll jump in there, Matt. And, yeah, we have seen significant deposit flows and we do think some of this will
stick around, just gave us the opportunity to optimize on the deposit side, where we have significant rundown
going on in the term deposit side of things and you're seeing DDA increase. And it gives us an opportunity to
interact with those customers more deeply.

But we do think a good portion of these deposits will be sticky. You've got like the balanced parking has held on
longer than we thought, stimulus will rise, and we suspect that some of that will run down. And as you think about
cash balances in 2021, we do expect cash balances to come down gradually over the year, but that's not all due
to deposits running off. It's really us optimizing our deposits and deploying those deposits into loan growth
throughout the year. So a good portion of it will stick around.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
All right. Matt, let me add one point on the consumer side. When you scrape away the surge deposits, the last
three years leading up to COVID, we have been performing top of peer set on low cost deposits. And when we try
to scrape that away in 2021, we believe that's still the case. And that's driven by underlying [indiscernible]
(00:25:21) consumer engagement metrics in the consumer bank. And so, I believe we're in a very strong position
putting all the COVID surge deposit aside to continue to outperform peers for at least the next 12 months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me just add one thing that on the commercial side, our treasury sales were up 31% last year on the
back of a lot of the investment that we've made over the last four to five years in that business. So not all of that
will result in DDA growth, but some of it will. Some will be fees and some of it will be DDA. So we're seeing sales
momentum on the treasury side, which is quite healthy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And somewhat related, what's your appetite to add securities either at these yields or what – a price point going
forward? Obviously, you're optimistic on growing loans, which is going to absorb some of the deposits and
liquidity as you mentioned. But how are you thinking about the securities book where we are seeing some banks
grow it quite meaningfully even as rates come down for mortgage-backeds? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks for that, Matt. I mean, we've been patient on this through, call, the second half of 2020 and have
held off and allowed cash balances to rise, like many have as well. And in part, the reason for that was given the
levels for mortgage-backeds, which is where we primarily operate in our securities book. The levels there were
not attractive. As you get into the early part of 2021, the levels have improved a little bit.
And so, we may find ourselves considering investing the cash flows that we otherwise would get back on
prepayments, let's say, later in the quarter, February or March. We may find ourselves investing some of that in
January, sort of a pre-investment, if you will. And then stop and see where that plays out. But you won't see us
going in heavily reinvesting all of this cash in long-term mortgage-backed securities.
I mean, I think that to the extent that we want to capture a little bit of this rate rise early in the quarter, we've done
a little bit of that and we may do a little more if rates continue to hang in or possibly rise. But it's more of a dollar
cost averaging situation and put a little bit to work and wait and see rather than piling all this cash into securities
at these levels.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And I would just add, Matt, that to me it's really terrific that we have this much cash because, A, it prefunds the
loan growth, and that's really where we're targeting. The loan growth will be better than securities growth, in our
view. And it also allows us to take reasonably aggressive pricing actions to drive some of the balances away. So
we've got our game plan here. If we see a little flex-up in securities rates, we're ready to engage. But at this point,
we're being fairly disciplined and cautious.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
My first question, Bruce, is on the buyback process for this year. Heard you loud and clear that the board
authorized $750 million. And so, I guess, this is a two-part question. Number one, are you opting in or opting out
of participating in this year's stress test? And if opting out, does that give you leeway in terms of your repurchase
size? And what is the timing of that $750 million?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Maybe I'll start and John can add some color. But we haven't made the determination yet as to whether
we'll opt in or opt out, and there's some nuances that could be tailwinds for us. And then, also the bloated balance
sheets and the Fed's model runs expenses based on the size of your balance sheet. That could be a headwind.
So we're kind of calibrating that. We have to make a decision by February 15.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
This gives a little more time to mull it over. But regardless of whether we opt in or opt out, we have plenty of
flexibility here to buy back our stock, and I think we can be reasonably aggressive. The thing that's more the
limiter for us is going to be our capital range which is our internal targets of 9.75% to 10%. Not really worried
about hitting the stress capital buffer. So, we set the program up with a big enough size that I think we can
neutralize the earnings after RWA growth. And there's some wildcards as to how big the reserve release could be.
So, I think we have a decent amount of authorization to cover that if we get favorability on that. So, we would
expect most of this would be executed this year but it could easily go over into next year and some of that
depends on the amount of loan growth and the amount of the reserve release.
Any color, John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean they just gave us a little bit of flexibility there in terms of – I think it's now April
5 where we can take our time and determine whether it makes sense to opt in. But I think Bruce laid it out well in
terms of the tradeoffs which really – we've seen some changes in the Fed model that would help our PPNR
profile. And the fact that we keep generating high levels of PPNR is good as it relates to how they forecast as we
understand it on some of the history. So that's real positive that might lean us towards opting in. But then, as
Bruce articulated, we also now understand that all of this cash that we're holding shows up in total assets, and
then we understand that the model basically converts that into expenses that we're somehow going to incur.
And so, we're going to have to, frankly, just put pen to paper here and calculate what we think the benefits are of
opting in. We'll also get to see the scenario and evaluate all of that. But more importantly, the SCB is not our
constraint and it's basically our operating levels. And so, it's sort of an academic exercise in a lot of ways in terms
of whether we opt in or not this coming year. And I think, Bruce, handled the buyback question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And my second question is on your noninterest expense outlook. Really appreciate slide 28, which breaks
down how you budgeted getting from 2020 to 2021. And I guess my question here is, is this 1% to 2% outlook
fully reflective of what sounds like a more optimistic outlook for second half loan growth as well as mortgage
volumes? And if any of those components disappoint, does that slide you at the lower end of the range or out of
the range? I guess I'm thinking if revenues disappoints, what would this look like?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think we always maintain flexibility to cap down expenses if we're not seeing the revenues come
through. Obviously, earlier in the year you have visibility and make that call, you're going to have a bigger impact
on the expense base in the current year. You can see on that slide, Erika, that there's volume-driven expenses
that would be the first ones to adjust and they could adjust even lower than that range. But then some of the
strategic investments that we're making we could space those out a bit as well. And then, we could always go
back to the well and look to upsize the TOP program again. So, I think there's a number of avenues we have and
levers that we can pull if it came to that. At this point, however, we're pretty sanguine that the economy is going to
be recovering and it'll be a little slower going in the first half of the year but actually pick up quite nicely in the
second half year. So, that's the call that we're making.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I might just jump in and add that mortgages creates a fair bit of variability on the expense line. And if you
just kind of normalize for mortgage expenses, noninterest expense is flat really from 2019 to 2020 to 2021. So,
and I think that's an important point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Ex the mortgage growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Ex the mortgage growth, if you just kind of normalize it back to 2019 levels. And that sort of allows us to on,
an ex-mortgage basis, to be continuing to drive positive operating leverage throughout each of those years which
is important.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Wanted to see if you could, Bruce, possibly give us your updated thoughts on M&A just given your capital levels
and given the opportunities that you're starting to see develop on the banking side and on the capital markets
side. Wanted to get your thoughts on both on the whole bank side as well as nonbanks, particularly I know you've
mentioned the capital markets opportunity. So, interested if you're exploring, deepening your banking capabilities
on that front. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Well, it was a relatively quiet year for us in 2020 not for lack of trying. So, we certainly looked at a number of
things and had a number of conversations. But we remain very disciplined buyers in terms of the financial profile
that we need to see and then also the strategic and cultural fit. And so, we'll continue to, I think, have outreach
and engage in those dialogues, and we'll see if we can get some things done in 2021.
Just in terms of our focus, we've been consistently focused over the last several years on augmenting our
capabilities in terms of acquiring fee-based businesses so we can do more for our customers. That was one of the
gaps that we had from the IPO days, was that we weren't at scale in certain activities that are quite important and
are important to our customers.
So, I think we've pretty much addressed the mortgage area. We've yet to fully address the wealth opportunity.
And so, we're still active in conversations in the wealth space. And then, also in M&A, we've gone a long way
towards cementing that capability here, but there could be selective opportunities for us to augment our industry
vertical approach with some boutique acquisitions.
In terms of whole bank, we, I think, see what's going on that there's a race for scale and there may be some
things that turn out to be interesting there. But we've been quite disciplined in our approach there and we've really
just prioritized organic growth, prioritize the growth of our digital bank. We'd have to see something that made a
lot of sense from a financial standpoint, customer base capabilities, geography, for us to move in that direction.
But we're certainly open to it and we'll kind of keep the periscope out and see if there's anything that makes
sense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately on the – regarding your merchant partnerships, just wonder if you
could give us an update there on how they've been performing? Have they've been performing as expected when
it comes to the returns from those programs and are you expecting to add more this year? Thanks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Short answer is, yes, they have. When you look at the credit performance of the merchant business, again
while we're not out of the woods on the environment around us, the delinquency on that asset has been flat to
down and the percentage of those customers that found their way into forbearance is negligible. And so, the

portfolio was operating essentially like there's no recession going on around us and that's a lot driven by the
positive select of the customer base and the frictionless digital experience that we created, that the payment gets
automatically drafted out of the customers' account every month. And so, we're very encouraged by the size of
credit performance. The return to the business are credit card-like, but the risk profile seems to be lower than
credit card-like. So, you're getting outsized returns from the portfolio than you otherwise would expect. So, we're
excited about that.
As I mentioned we're also excited about the growth that we generated in 2021. We had two or three key partners
entering the year. We're going to exit the year with 10 to 12. And as John teased, in about a week's time we'll
have a relatively large announcement about another big partnership that we got to play in the introduction of
Citizens Pay which is sort of our new platform that really takes that business to the next level. We're very, very
encouraged by the opportunity in the marketplace and our first-mover advantage. You're seeing more and more
talk about this in the industry. Retailers and merchants are now looking at this as a way that they can dramatically
improve their sales in a down economy. And so, we're getting more and more inbound calls from companies
looking for us to help them reengineer their sales process and try to give them a revenue boost. So, we're very
excited about this. We think it's very distinctive part of Citizens, and we remain poised to capitalize on the
opportunity.

John, can you share with us – obviously, you guys have been very clear about the outlook for credit which is good
for 2021 and loan loss reserve releasing that you and your peers are very likely to see because of the improving
economy especially in the second half of the year. Can you tell us what you think the loan loss reserve to loans
will get to? Because if I recall based on your data I think the post-CECL reserve level on January 1, 2020 was
1.47%. You're obviously well above that. Do you think that's – is that a targeted area that we should kind of look
to in the future or will it be something higher?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think it's a good question, Gerard. I mean, I think that it's a good sort of anchor point when you
look back at something in the neighborhood of 1.45% on day one CECL. The one thing that we think about
regarding that 1.45% is that we hadn't had a credit cycle for close to, I guess, around a decade leading into that
1.45%. So, there was a probability weighting that would expect a credit cycle to happen sometime over the
horizon of the CECL sort of projection.
And so, in some ways, we think that what's going on now there's – the decks are getting cleared out. We certainly
had a cycle and we're going through one. And so, in terms of the resting point for our coverage ratios, it's unlikely
to be higher than that. I mean I think it would be in that neighborhood. There are some arguments that would
suggest that maybe it could be a little lower. But maybe given mix and other things it could be a little higher. But
you've got to think about all those things and we wouldn't expect it to be much higher than that.
And in terms of timing, I mean your guess is thoughtfully as good as mine. But we do think that things improve
pretty significantly here in 2021. We're going to move relatively down pretty significantly from our current levels,
which are quite high. As you get into the end of the year, we're going to be heading towards that level that I talked
about. The timing of that is really – given CECL, it happens pretty quickly, I mean if the economic environment
continues to improve. And when you think about it, we got an improved economic environment just here in
January that wasn't even reflected in our results for the fourth quarter. If that trajectory continues, we could start
heading towards that level as you get towards the end of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add to that though. I think, Gerard, you have to look at this really over time. And I think we'll get
part of the way, so that we'll be somewhere between where we are in that 1.45% or, as John said, maybe slightly
better 1.45% resting place. A lot has to play out in terms of economic recovery and how much stimulus and all of
that. So, I think we'll make strides certainly below 2% and on the way towards getting down there but it'll be
somewhere in the middle and we'll have to see how things play out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. We like that trajectory for you and your peers. A bigger picture question for you Bruce, your outlook is
quite optimistic which we concur with, so we're with you on what we expect as well from you and your peers.
When you go down the elevator at night, what's the risk that you worry about because there just seems to be so
many positives over the next 12 months potentially for all the banks including your own and I always worry about
something out on the field, like obviously nobody knew the pandemic was going to be as bad as it was. But what
do you worry about when you go down the elevator at night?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I guess we're getting increasing comfort that with the vaccinations, with the stimulus that the economic
outlook is improving and that we will have recovery next year. So, I wouldn't – that may have been a big worry in
2020. I think it's less a worry today going down the elevator. I think you go back to managing other risks, for
example, the whole cyber and fraud risk that's out there, is something that is top of mind and all the banks are
spending a hell of a lot of time making sure that our customer assets are safe and the way we're running things,

data is safe, et cetera. So, that is I think a big focal point for us and other banks and I'd kind of keep that at the top
of the list at this point.
Anything else, Brendan? I guess competition would be the next thing is that, certainly, we faced intense
competition since the IPO from all-comers, from the mega banks, from peers, from smaller banks, from nonbanks,
fintechs. And so, continuing to really delight our customers and do a great job for our customers so they have no
desire to switch, given all the competition that's out there, it's one of the reasons that we've been really motivated
to go out and invest in technology, and invest in customer experience, invest in new capabilities, so we can do
more for our customers really to cement those customer relationships. And so, if I had to pick a close second, that
would probably be the second thing on my list.
Guys, anything else you'd add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just think that the industry going through such a transformation accelerated by COVID with digital, just the
speed and pace of executing on a very substantial change and I feel exceptionally confident about where we're
positioned. The market's moving fast. And I think the banks that can execute the best on that will be in the
winner's circle at the end of the next two years' time. And we're making the right investments I think, but it's a
quite sizable change...

There might have been a little drop-off coming from round one had round two not come in, but just the way we –
our outlook for round two which just started in earnest actually and is going quite well for us over the last 24
hours, and Brendan may actually give us a few comments on that. But, in general, pretty similar profile from 2021
compared to 2020.

Forgiveness, the way we account, as you may know, in round one, we have been amortizing over the two-year
period in round one the deferred fees. And so, the farther you get into this two-year period, the lower the impact
on forgiveness. And so, forgiveness is actually not a very big impact in 4Q and it won't either be in 1Q or 2Q as
well. It's pretty stable. And so, that's basically best way to talk about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Just maybe we could pivot and, Brendan, you could just offer a view on the latest PPP program because we're up
and running and accepting apps and we are off to a terrific start yesterday.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, absolutely. And the latest round of PPP started yesterday, as Bruce and John mentioned, embedded in our
outlook, has less than half of the originations that we saw in the first round. The first day was exceptionally strong.
We executed incredibly well. We ended overnight with a little bit shy of 14,000 applications. Technology worked
really, really well and pushed up a little bit over $1 billion in application. So TBD on the funding, but it's heavily,
heavily driven by PPP round one borrowers.
And so, we've got confidence the conversion rate will be pretty high existing customers of ours. So we're very,
very pleased by our performance on day one and we expect the demand to be pretty strong over the next couple
of weeks here. So we'll know more in the coming weeks on the size and if this pushes up higher than we thought.
TBD. It's hard to get a full gauge on the demand given the state of our small businesses. But all signs from day
one are very positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And then, for my next question, I guess it seems to be a trend that most banks are guiding to costs
higher than consensus expectations for 2021, largely driven by investment spend. Would you characterize your
investment spend as an acceleration or a pull forward of future strategic initiatives as a result of the pandemic or
something else? Or do you believe the $125 million in strategic initiative is a reasonable amount of new spend for
a typical year? And I have a quick follow-up after that if I can stay on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think we have worked really hard over the years to try to protect our investment spend in strategic
initiatives. So TOP has been a big contributor of delivering positive operating leverage. But it also allows us to
self-fund the things that we need to keep positioning us for future growth and growth in our top line. So I think that
$125 million feels right. And I think the banks that are going to come out of the pandemic well are the ones that
are continuing to look for opportunities to advantage their position in areas where they see opportunity and where
they have strength.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That makes sense. And then do you have an expectation for nonrecurring expenses or charges you may
incur as a result of the upside to TOP 6 in 2021? Thank you.

Hi. Great. Thanks. Actually, just staying on the NIM topic. If I got all the numbers right, it sounds like your full-year
NIM guidance is, call it, roughly 2.80%. Your first quarter is 2.75%, which means over the course of the year, your
NIM should actually improve pretty noticeably. Can you just talk about the drivers there? Is it either – and how

As we mentioned earlier, we are aggressively running down our term deposit levels and optimizing deposits in
general. So, you're going to get a nice mix shift in deposits that would drive some positive contribution towards net
interest margin.
And then, just pricing, outside of mix, our interest-bearing deposit costs we expect to fall. We're at 27 basis points
in the fourth quarter. We expect to drive that into the low- to mid-teens by the end of the year and that'll happen

again also gradually quarter-by-quarter as we go throughout the year. And then, the other item I'd highlight is that
with long end of the curve, we've got some steepening going on, maybe not as much as earlier in the month, but
certainly still some steepening that has occurred and more steepening that we think will likely occur over 2021.
So, therefore, that front book, back book drag that's been happening starts to – the magnitude of that starts to
also moderate as we put more money to work through loan growth. So, those are the drivers that I would highlight
throughout today.

If I can add to that too, Ken, I mean I think we're trying to show what the NIM is ex the excess cash and it's quite
significant. It's 17 basis points higher. And actually, Q3 to Q4 we were up a basis point but I think the analysts
community has been very, very, very focused almost to the point of being obsessed with NIM. The NIM number
with these elevated cash becomes a little less clear and so trying to think about NII really as the beacon here.
We're focused on managing NII, we're focused on trying to hold the underlying NIM. And then when we have all
this cash how do we put it to work smartly, how do we get loan growth, be cautious on securities as we discussed
earlier but really try to keep NII performing well. That's the shift I think that we're feeling here inside Citizens.

Kenneth Zerbe Q

Completely makes sense. And just a separate follow-up question, your NCO guidance, if you're already at 61
basis points and your guidance is sort of 50 basis points to 65 basis points, how do you see that playing out? I
mean should charge-off stay relatively stable sort of over the course of the year? Do you expect any particular
quarter like second quarter or third quarter to be a little more elevated sort of a hill shape versus a steady state
charge-offs? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, yeah, it's a little bit volatile on the commercial side as we saw back in Q3. So, you can get hit with a tall tree
and the numbers can move around a little bit. But generally speaking, right now, we've got really great trends in all
the credit metrics on the commercial side. So, I think the first half of the year looks really good where you have
the most visibility. I think going out into the second half of the year you've got to see what's – how fast do we get
to life as we knew it from the vaccinations. And then, how does that positively benefit commercial real estate. If it
goes well, then you could continue to see subdued levels. If you see some issues come to the surface because
things go a little less well, then I think that's a room for potential increase. But still, I think within under control kind
of in the realm of being under control.
And then, on the consumer side, we have kind of all-time great metrics in terms of delinquencies and performance
and we have had folks come out of forbearance. And interestingly, 94% of those people coming out of
forbearance are current. And so, we've been able to cross that bridge and not disturb the kind of really good credit
metrics we have. There's, certainly, now with additional stimulus and being targeted for the industries and the
people working in those industries most affected by COVID, there's more hope and ability for those folks to get
back on their feet. So, you could see, we, I think – we're thinking that pre this last round of stimulus and talk about
more stimulus that we could see an uptick in the second half of the year. But I think it's less clear that we're
actually going to see that and that can continue to kick out into the future than maybe just go away. So, I'd say
we're pretty sanguine at this point. But you have to expect the unexpected so that's why we have the range that
we do.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Kenneth Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Just want to sharpen the pencil a little bit on an earlier response to Amanda's question. But
specifically are you assuming for PPP forgiveness on round one and new origination on round two on your mid- to
high-single-digit EOP loan growth? Because it would seem like even the net number is something of a headwind
in 2021. So, if you could just help us fill in the gaps there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I got it and just talk to that. I mean, I think as I mentioned, year-over-year, the contribution to NII in 2020
from the PPP round one will be similar to the contribution we expect in 2021 from round one and round two
together on the NII line. And the forgiveness piece, which was potentially quite significant in 2020, is now no
longer so because we recognize a portion of all of those deferred fees every quarter as you click through. Every
quarter that goes by, we've been recognizing in NII a portion of what one might accelerate upon forgiveness such
that as you get into the first quarter that the numbers are not that great. They're single-digit millions. And so, from
that perspective, forgiveness is not a big story anymore with respect to at least the way we account for things and
we amortize the stuff pretty ratably over the two-year period. So, the contributions are stable year-over-year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would just add a little color on that is that the first program kind of stays level with the second half and
the first half of next year and that it's the second, the new PPP program that kind of prevents a falloff in the
second half of the year. So, if you want to think about it that way, we're kind of at relatively stable revenue levels
on the existing programs through the first half of the year. We would have had a falloff but now that we have the
new PPP, we kind of avoid having that falloff.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And one other point...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I guess my – if I could just interject a little bit here because we're kind of running out of time, sorry to interrupt, but
I guess my question – that's helpful color. My question was on loan growth though, not NII. The mid- to high-
single digit, it does – it would – presumably that has some forgiveness on the $4.5 billion and an accelerated
runoff of that which is a headwind. But you also have some new origination on round two. I guess my question is
net-net, how much of a headwind is that embedded into your mid- to high-single digit loan growth?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Just real quick in terms of dollars, as Brendan mentioned earlier, it's less than half of our originations on the
front-end. So, when you think about our average spot loan balances were about $4 billion dollars at the end of
2020 on this program, that falls to something in the neighborhood of $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2021.
So, you can basically get a sense for the fact that we're making up for that with the other categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, there's real headwind essentially. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, there is a headwind. We're overcoming it with the other categories outside of PPP. There's a shrinkage in
loan growth year-over-year that we had to overcome with other categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So, there's about $1.5 billion to $2 billion headwind net, i.e., forgiveness? How much is being – how much of the
round one is coming down versus how much new origination on round two net-net that is a headwind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
That's one of the reasons that we're guiding to high spot loan growth, but the average loan growth is less.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
That's one of the reasons.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Okay. Okay. Because it would seem that if I think about 1Q you're not going to – it doesn't seem like there
would be much growth and it would be fairly minimal in the first half of the year, which would imply the second half
acceleration that on the surface seems extremely rapid in the third and fourth quarter with annualized loan growth
being, I don't know the exact number, but being very, very rapid. And it seems, I mean I hear everything you say
but it does seem like you're really giving yourselves and the banks a lot of the benefit of the doubt that the
economic recovery will translate at a very, very rapid loan growth. So, I'm just curious if you – how strongly you
disagree with that logic?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2021
Well, we're standing by the guidance we're giving. And I think you have to recall we went through each of the
portfolios earlier in the call and we have probably more sales out in terms of an ability to capture loan growth than
our peers and we've demonstrated that consistently since the IPO.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just say on the consumer side, while an economic recovery is expected and will help, the originations that
we've embedded in our guidance we're ramping them up right now in today's current economic upside. I don't
know that we're betting on a massive upswing that's fully dependent on our loan growth. I think we can deliver.
We're going to start delivering it right now.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

Operator: And due to time constraints, we have time for one more question which will come from the line of Bill
Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your capital targets. By our math, your stress capital buffer was up
around 376 basis points in the December stress test, up about 40 basis points from the June stress test. And that
suggests required capital of around 8.25% or less, which is a fair amount below your target range. So, my
question is could we see your target range come down over time? I believe you mentioned, John, that the SCB is
not your constraint but rather your operating levels. Could you expand on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll just start off and Bruce may add in here. But yeah, I mean, I think our current target is 9.75% to 10%.
And the implied levels from SCB would be well below that. From the middle part of the year, from the June test,
we had an SCB of 3.4%. You add that to the required minimum of 4.5%, and you get a 7.9%. That's the official
SCB unless and until the Fed decides to change it and they have up until March 31 to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And if I could just interject, we think that's too high because they're not following PPNR correctly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Correct.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So we set pretty much lower than that. Even at 7%, it does come back to prudent and conservatism. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think target levels from where we want to see our ratings shake out, what we view in terms of
managing the risks of the platform would be well north of the 7.9%. So, it just doesn't come into play in a lot of
ways even though we do think it's too high. So, yeah, I mean, I think the other point we would make, we said over
the years that we don't think our platform is any riskier than our peer sets. And if the economic environment and
the group believes, if capital levels decline over time as we clear the decks post-pandemic, we wouldn't see our
capital levels needing to be higher than the average of our peers and who knows, we'll see. But right now, our
board, and management, and Bruce have worked on this target range, which we believe will serve us and
allowing us to navigate through the pandemic and [indiscernible] (01:05:00) there's a possibility.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one last one, I wanted to follow up on your comments
around the securities portfolio. Can you discuss what kind of reinvestment rates you're seeing relative to the
1.95% that saw this quarter? I was hoping you could discuss how much curve steepening we would need to see
for the downward pressure from reinvestment rates to abate, particularly since it looks like some of the dynamics
from QE have led agency MBS spreads to turn negative and you guys have a pretty sizable portion of your
investment portfolio in the asset class?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think reinvestment yields are in the, call it, the 1.20% to 1.30% range, and that's creating a, call it, 50 to 60
basis point front book, back book drag given what's running off. The back book runoff is in, call it, the 1.80% to
1.85% range. So that's been a phenomenon that's been occurring over the last couple of quarters. We are
watching OASs. OASs were positive last quarter. Even though yields are up OASs have tightened a little bit this
quarter.
As I also mentioned earlier, we get about $800 million of cash flow a month and from time-to-time we'll invest
cash flows in advance of coming months. And we did a little bit of that in June but we're not going to put a lot of

cash to work in this kind of rate environment unless and until yields begin to rise a bit more and OASs look a bit
more favorable. So, we're doing a little bit of investing there to get ahead of some things but not a lot.
