I'll now turn the call over to Steve Bradshaw.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2021 financial results. This quarter was
another in which our diversified revenue strategy was a key differentiator for us as we grew pre-tax pre-provision
earnings by 10% on a linked quarter basis and eclipsed $160 million in net income for the first time in the history
of our company.
Shown on slide 4, second quarter net income was a record $166.4 million or $2.40 per diluted share. That
represents growth in net income of nearly 14% from last quarter and a result of our long-term commitment to our
balanced earnings model and our breadth of business capabilities. The key items that drove our success this
quarter were another outstanding contribution from our fee-based business units, with total fees and commissions
up $7.3 million or 4.5% from last quarter. The contribution from our Wealth Management team continues to be a
differentiator for us, offsetting narrowing margins and housing inventory constraints that impacted our mortgage
company this quarter.
Net interest revenue stabilized as a similar amount of PPP forgiveness was recognized again this quarter, as it
was in Q1. Additionally, deposit costs reduction outpaced rate compression on loan yields and in our available for
sale portfolio. The increasingly favorable economic outlook, combined with improving credit trends, allowed us to
release $35 million of our loan loss reserve. And lastly, expense management remains excellent with total
expenses relatively flat linked quarter when you exclude the $4 million charitable contribution we made in the first
quarter that did not reoccur in the second quarter.
Turning to slide 5, total loans are down $1.1 billion for the quarter, but PPP loan forgiveness accounts for $727
million of that contraction. Core loan growth did remain a challenge this quarter as our energy and commercial
real estate customers continue to paydown debt or refinance in long-term markets. That said, we saw stable loan
balances in our core C&I book – Stacy's going to cover that momentarily – which reaffirm our belief that we are
poised for growth opportunities as the economy continues to rebound.
Average deposits were up nearly 3% this quarter and nearly 15% from the same quarter a year ago, as the
growth trend we've seen there for the past 18 months continues. Assets under management or in custody in our
Wealth Management business were also up, they were up 5% in this quarter. I'll provide additional perspective on
the results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Stacy Kymes will review the loan portfolio and our credit
metrics in more detail.
I'll just now turn the call over to Stacy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide 7. Period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $20.3 billion, down just under
2% for the quarter as we continue to see borrowers in some specialty winning areas continue to reduce leverage.
That said, certain areas of portfolio saw increasing pipelines and real growth that outpaced paydowns. Energy
balances continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in previous periods.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Both oil and natural gas prices have moved up swiftly in 2021, leading to improved credit metrics and providing
material cash flow for energy companies. US rig counts are moving up very modestly and are just a little over half
of what they were before the pandemic. As we move into the fall when capital budgets are established, I suspect
we will begin to see more drilling activity if prices remain near current levels. This would organically increase loan
demand.
Ancillary business from hedging, investment banking, and treasury were all very good for this segment this
quarter. Healthcare balances grew 2.8% this quarter, driven by our senior housing sector. Looking forward, we
remain very confident in our ability to perform both from a growth and credit standpoint in this portfolio as it
remains a leader for us.
Core middle market C&I today is at the lowest level of utilization as any measured period back to March of 2015,
which shows we have capacity to move up as demand starts to come back online, without it being predicated on
new customer acquisition. Overall, seeing the broad C&I portfolio begin to stabilize is a real positive coming out of
this quarter and bodes well for our outlook for returning loan growth later this year and in the next year.
Commercial real estate balance has contracted 5.7% this quarter. We continue to see borrowers use this low rate
environment to refinance to the long-term fixed rate nonrecourse market. 2020 was one of the real estate's lowest
years for portfolio turnover, as many of the permanent markets were cautious. As hose have opened back up, we
see some catch up activity that's inherently a sign of a healthy portfolio, but can create some quarter-to-quarter
volatility.
PPP loan balance forgiveness was substantial this quarter with $727 million forgiven, shrinking the portfolio by
nearly 40%. We expect to have another period of forgiveness activity early in the third quarter from the 2020
vintage of PPP before it slows in the remainder of 2021.
Looking ahead, we remain positioned well for loan growth later this year, and next year when economic activity
creates borrowing needs for working capital. We are hopeful the stability in our C&I book this quarter signals we
are turning the corner on loan demand in our core markets.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to improve as we move further out from the pandemic.
We saw meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio with non-performing assets and
potential problem loans both down significantly this quarter.
These factors, coupled with the rebound in commodity prices to multi-year highs and strong economic forecasts
for GDP growth and labor markets, led us to release $35 million in reserves this quarter.
Net charge-offs were $15.4 million or 30 basis points annualized, excluding PPP loans in the second quarter.
That's essentially flat from last quarter's $14.5 million. Net charge-offs averaged 32 basis points over the last four
trailing quarters, which is at the lower end of our historic loss range. As we look forward to the latter half of 2021,
we expect net charge-offs to be at or modestly better than the result of the first half of this year.
The combined allowance for loan losses totaled $336 million or 1.66% of outstanding loans at quarter end,
excluding the PPP loans. Non-accruing loans decreased $36.4 million from last quarter, primarily due to a
reduction in non-accruing energy loans.
Potential problem loans totaled $384 million at quarter end, down significantly from $422 million on March 31.
Potential problem energy, services and general business loans, all decreased compared to the prior quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
We will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have. We are generally positive about
the credit outlook for the remainder of the year. Future allowance levels will be impacted by economic activity,
commodity prices, asset quality and loan growth.
Turning to slide 9, you can see that our Wealth Management team had another outstanding quarter. Total Wealth
Management revenues were $131.1 million, up nearly 15% from the previous quarter. This includes the fee
income lines that investors see in our corporate income statement, brokerage and trading, and fiduciary and asset
management, as well as net interest income from loans and deposits in our Private Wealth group, and net interest
income generated as part of our brokerage and trading group.
Banking products and services for Private Wealth clients continue to be a particular area to highlight. The total
loan portfolio, bordering on $2 billion, grew 3% linked-quarter and 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago.
The deposit portfolio, ending the quarter at $3.7 billion, grew 5% linked-quarter and was up 13% compared to the
same quarter a year ago. Total net interest income also saw strong growth in this quarter, up 7%.
Total brokerage and trading revenues increased $10.5 million or 20% linked-quarter. This is largely due to a shift
in product strategy this quarter in our institutional trading and sales business, coupled with adding new financial
institution clients. Importantly, as we look forward, we believe the revenue from this shift in product focus and
expanded customer base is sustainable in the third quarter before modest seasonal declines as you get into the
fourth quarter.
Also in the Wealth Management space, fiduciary and asset management fees were up nearly 9% linked-quarter,
as well as from the same quarter a year ago. A portion of the linked-quarter growth is due to the annual tax fees
that are charged in the second quarter, but we still saw a strong growth in assets under management. And we
have seen the benefit of favorable equity markets increasing customer account balances. Sales activity remains
strong in this base as well.
Our relationship-driven business model is perfectly in touch with the clients' needs today as we continue to see
institutions and individuals retain the increased appreciation for financial advice gained through the last 18
months.
Transaction card revenue was up $2.5 million or 11% this quarter. This is largely due to stimulus measures and
the broader reopening of the US economy, as we saw both merchant and ATM transaction volumes increase this
quarter.
Deposit service charges were up $1.7 million or nearly 7% this quarter, primarily centered in our Commercial
businesses. Lower earnings credit rates due to lower interest rates resulted in higher service charges this quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased $15.9 million linked-quarter due to the broader economic factors currently
impacting the industry. Increasing average mortgage interest rates, in particular, were a factor this quarter as that
moved the mix between refi and purchase funding from 65% refi last quarter to 48% refi this quarter.
Industry-wide housing inventory constraints and the recent preferred stock purchase agreement, delivery limits on
second homes and investment properties imposed on Fannie and Freddie both impacted the quarter. In addition
to volume, the increased competition for inventory impacted gain on sale margins, which were closer to pre-
pandemic levels this quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
We expected mortgage revenues to dip this year due to changing environment, but our mortgage team is doing a
good job managing the transition to a purchased market. We are better positioned than most of our non-bank
competitors as the market shifts to more of a home purchase financing.
While this quarter's contribution was down from the record levels we saw throughout the past year, the rate
pressure did ease as the quarter unfolded. We still expect this business to be a significant contributor to our
diversified fee revenue strategy going forward.
Although not included on slide 9, I will also note that the net economic hedges in the fair value of mortgage
servicing rights and related economic hedges were a positive $4.4 million during the quarter. Other revenue
increased $6.9 million this quarter due to higher production level from repossessed oil and gas properties, which
was largely offset by increased operating expenses. Looking forward, this level of revenue and expense will
diminish as these properties are sold.
I'll now turn over the call to Steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Steven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 11, second quarter net interest revenue was $280 million, largely unchanged
compared to last quarter. Average earning assets decreased $354 million compared to the first quarter, and
average loan balances decreased $590 million. Available for sale securities decreased $190 million as we
continue to reinvest most of the quarterly cash flows from the portfolio. Average trading securities grew by $467
million to support our brokerage and trading business. Non-interest deposits grew $877 million this quarter, which
also helped support net interest income.
Net interest margin was 2.60%, down just 2 basis points from the previous quarter. The reinvestment of cash
flows from our available for sale securities portfolio was stable this quarter due to prepayments from commercial
mortgage-backed securities. However, the expectation is that there will be continued supply pressure due to a
reinvestment of this low-rate environment.
Additionally, we had continued success driving interest-bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points to 14 basis
points on average for the quarter. PPP loans supported net interest margin by 2 basis points this quarter,
unchanged from last quarter. There are many moving parts to consider, but we believe the extensive pressure felt
on net interest margin since early 2020 is beginning to wane. We think we could be nearing a bottom in net
interest margin but do not expect any positive migration there until rates begin to rise again.
With sooner than anticipated rate hikes now potentially on the horizon, it's important to recall how well we
performed during the last rate hike cycle from 2015 to 2019, in the top quartile of regional banks. While we can't
be assured to repeat that experience, we don't see much that would lead us to believe the experience will be
significantly different. In fact, there is even more liquidity in the system today than before the last increased cycle,
which should diminish the need for the market to move rates up quickly.
Turning to slide 12. Expense management remains prudent with total expenses down 1.6% linked quarter.
Personnel expense was essentially flat this quarter. A regular compensation decrease of $1.1 million was mostly
offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense. All told, we are very happy with our ability to hold the
personnel cost efficiencies earned through the pandemic and expect to do so going forward.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Non-personnel expense was down $3.7 million this quarter. Mortgage banking costs decreased $2.8 million due
to the decrease in prepayments, combined with lower accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation
costs and loan service for others. Data processing and communication expense decreased $1 million as a result
of reduction of system conversion expenses. Other expense increased $3.6 million, primarily due to increased
operating expense on repossessed assets. Also, of note, last quarter, we made a $4 million charitable
contribution to our BOKF Foundation that did not reoccur this quarter.
On slide 13, our liquidity position remains very strong. Our loan-to-deposit ratio declined from nearly 60% last
quarter to just over 57% at June 30, largely due to the significant decline in PPP balances this quarter. This
significant on balance sheet liquidity leaves us very well-positioned to meet future customer needs. Our capital
position levels remain strong as well, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12%, well ahead of our internal
operating minimum. With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchase,
optimistically repurchasing nearly 493,000 shares at an average price of $88.84 per share in the open market.
One additional thing of note is that we plan to redeem our $150 million subordinated debt issue in June of 2016
using existing capital. Given the strength of our capital levels, we have decided not to reissue this debt. This will
impact only the total capital ratio at the holding company level by 42 basis points, but will save the company
approximately $8 million annually on a go-forward basis.
On slide 14, I'll leave you with some general outlook for the near and mid term. We believe net activity and loan
growth will continue to improve with our company positioned for positive growth in the second half of the year if
borrower demand exists. We expect the overall loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances to continue to
migrate towards pre-pandemic levels.
Net interest margin may continue to move down slightly, largely from continued downward re-pricing in our
available for sale securities portfolio. We believe we are close to the bottom in our interest-bearing deposit pricing
at 14 basis points. That said, we believe the significant pressure on net interest margin seen in past quarters is
largely behind us now.
Our diverse portfolio of fee revenue streams should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue
pressure being felt in our spread businesses. We expect most fee revenue categories to grow modestly for the
remainder of 2021. We will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non-personnel costs,
with growth budgeted at low-single digits in 2021. Our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses
without sacrificing multi-year technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we feel good about our capital strength. We will continue looking for share
buyback opportunities, and plan to maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level. I'll now turn the call back
over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.

Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steven. As I mentioned at the top of the call, it was another exceptional quarter for BOK Financial. We
continue to do the right things in the right way for the benefit of our long-term investors, adding shareholder value
without compromising credit discipline or foregoing investment that might hinder the company's future. And as
witnessed by our credit outcomes and the outsized Wealth Management contribution this quarter, we continue to
do that in a prudent, diversified way.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
While this quarter was, once again, about the contribution from our fee-based businesses, the vastly improving
outlook for growth in our footprint as we emerge from the pandemic is driving customer confidence in a way we
haven't seen for quite some time. While supply chain and workforce disruptions might be hampering some areas
in the near term, economic indicators remain strong which portends well for the future.
With growth returning to our healthcare book this quarter and pipelines returning to pre-pandemic levels in other
areas as C&I, we are very optimistic about the restart of some of our largest growth drivers in the company.
Additionally, we were pleased to welcome back our remote workers this quarter and believe that the energy and
teamwork that's core to our company will also play a role in our growth expectations in the second half of the year.
With that, we're pleased to take your questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: And at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the loan growth. Obviously, some trends are improving but it seems
like there's still some pressure on loan growth. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about the third quarter
because it does seem like average loans could still be down in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you could
talk about some of the puts and takes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Peter, this is Stacy. I think the story for us, as you think about the second quarter and then going to the third
quarter, was really stability in our core C&I book. We've had growth in our wealth lending platform for a while now,
and that was a real strong story for this quarter and we think that will continue into next year. But if we can get
past the paydowns in energy and commercial real estate, I think you're going to see that core C&I begin to grow
as we get into the latter half of this year.
We actually saw it in May. We're hoping we could string two months together and then have something really fun
to talk about this quarter, but we backed up a little bit in C&I in the month of June. So – but we're – we really
reached the point where those balances are real stable at this point. We're seeing months where we pop up and
have some poor growth in the C&I.
Energy paydowns, it's hard to know when we've reached the bottom there. I think we're awfully close. But we've
worked through a lot of the issues there from a credit perspective that have created some of the paydown activity.
Those borrowers are flush with cash flow with prices much higher than what they would have budgeted at. As we
go into the fall, that's typically when E&P companies do their capital budgeting. I think that, at these price levels,
you're going to see more drilling activity which will create more demand on the energy side.
Commercial real estate's a little bit of a different story. We've had real consistent loan generation there even
through the downturn. But the capital markets, in many respects, were closed last year with COVID. And so, a lot

of those stabilized properties that can move to the permanent non-recourse side of things have done that. And so,
it's created some paydowns that created some lumpiness.
And when we looked at the quarter and how it was unfolding, I mean, really, the story for us was the C&I balances
were very stable that – it was really the headwind from energy and commercial real estate, which we think, if it's
not behind us, it's very close to being behind us. But when you talk to the core C&I guys about their pipelines,
about what they're seeing, about the borrower optimism. I can't remember a time when borrowers have been
more optimistic about economic growth and that's going to create organic demand.
But I think we're close. We're optimistic about the latter half of this year, certainly optimistic about next year in
terms of the ability to grow that core C&I portfolio. We mentioned in the prepared remarks about utilization rates.
Utilization rates in our corporate are the lowest we've seen in a long, long time.
So as we begin to get borrower need for capital, that's going to have an opportunity to grow and create organic
demand as well. So when the market provides the opportunity to grow, I think we're going to get our share or
disproportionate share because of how well-positioned we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's really helpful – very helpful. If I could switch gears about the securities portfolio, Steven, average
securities were down this quarter. And I just assume, with rates even lower, not really a lot of interest moving
excess cash into securities. I was just wondering if you could talk about the outlook for the securities and if you're
planning on replacing maturing securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
We are, Peter. We'll still have around $700 million, I would say, in cash flows off of the AFS portfolio each quarter
and our plan is to continue to reinvest that. Now, rates have moved down a little bit here, but we'll continue to look
for opportunities.
The quarter was down, I think, $190 million. I think that was just timing really. There's no particular strategy to
move that balance down. I think we want to continue to reinvest those cash flows on a go-forward basis and keep
the portfolio relatively level around that $12.8 billion to $13 billion kind of range in the AFS portfolio.

Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yeah. So I wanted to touch on deposit growth. I saw average balances were up in the quarter, but, on a period-
end basis, balances were down a little bit. And I want to just know what was going on there, if there are any
seasonal factors to note of? And what is the expectation for deposit growth for the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. I think, one, the entire industry is seeing enormous liquidity in the system and we've certainly benefited from
that; enormous deposit growth for us year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I think if you start to look at period-
end numbers, you get a lot of fluctuation between deposit balances and things that happen there.
We have a lot of customers who have benefited from stimulus funds that have come in over the course of the first
half of the year. Those will go back out – those are going back out. We've had some energy customers who've
done things where we've had an influx of cash for a period of time that goes back out to some place other than
the balance sheet.
And so, really, the focus for us is kind of the average balances because that really is more representative of kind
of the core growth there. I think if we knew the answer to what deposit balances we're going to do in 2022, that'd
be a helpful thing for all of us. I think the industry is going to struggle with that as we begin to formulate plans for
2022, specifically.
We have so much liquidity in the system today, it's beyond what any of us have experienced in our career. And
so, the timing of when that begins to flow back out into investment or out of consumers' pockets as the stimulus
continues to impact them as well is a fair question to ask.
And I don't think our crystal ball is much different than anybody else's. I mean, it clearly will begin to go probably
not as fast as we think that it will. It tends to be stickier. This time last year, third quarter, fourth quarter, we were
predicting a lot of those deposit balances would move out of the banking system. That hasn't happened. The
system has grown and we certainly have grown as well, and we're not paying above a market rate for sure to be
able to do that. It's just kind of organic relationship driven deposits there.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And I know the loan to deposit ratio is sub-50% now and I know this is hard to gauge based off how
you just answered my previous question. But are you hopeful that loan growth could outpace deposit growth later
this year and into next year? Is that the thought?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
I think if you look at our company, I mean, we've typically been kind of closer to 85% loan-to-deposit ratio
overtime. And I think what happens when you get the economy moving again, that you're going to have, both
sides of the equation, you're going to have loan growth and you're going to have deposit outflows; and the result
of that is going to be a loan-to-deposit ratio that's probably much more reflective of our history than the current
period is.
And so, clearly, the opportunity for that's going to create positive momentum around earnings. One of the things
that Steven alluded to in his remarks, I think, that's very important is how well-positioned we think we are when
the Fed does begin to move. I think there's a lot of net interest revenue that will come back into the forefront.
There's a lot of fee revenue in Scott's wealth world that will come back into the forefront whenever rates begin to
move a little bit. And there's been a lot of analysis that we've seen that kind of seems to focus on how everybody
is modeling an increasing rate environment when that day does come.
And I think, from our perspective, we've been through that. I think the actual results are probably a better indicator
of the future than how everybody's models are working because there's so many different assumptions that go
into that. And so, we would ask the community – investment community to really focus on who performed well the
last time there was an increasing rate cycle. And I think you'll find that we performed exceptionally well and have
pin-up earnings that will show up once rates begin to move.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, we have talked about – or you guys have talked about C&I utilization rates being still pretty low. Can you just
tell us what that percentage is in the quarter, and then what a more normalized level would be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
The core C&I was below 50% and if you look at kind of the history in that segment, something closer to 55% to
60%. And even that's a little bit misleading because you're – a lot of our core C&I is borrowing base driven with
accounts receivable and inventory. So those borrowing bases, those commitment levels can increase and
decrease depending upon inventory and receivable levels, which – so it's not a perfect apples-to-apples because I
think you'll see those commitments increase as well once – not just utilization increase, but the commitments will
organically increase once kind of a more normal economic environment exists.
So, I think there's a lot of organic opportunity. I'm not downplaying the customer acquisition process because
we're very focused on that. But I think there's a lot of it – of built up loan growth that will show up on the balance
sheet once the national economy kind of looks normal again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then on the buyback, it's great to see some buyback this quarter. The stock is cheaper today than
kind of where you guys bought it back in the second quarter. So, should we expect a step up in the buyback, as
you guys potentially get a little more aggressive and you have excess capital, the stock is cheap, should we
expect more buybacks going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we'll be active. I don't know if we'll end up spending the $40 million or $45 million that we did, like we did
this quarter. But I – we do have the capacity. We stay opportunistic with it. Scott and I work together on a daily
basis to figure out what we're going to do. And I think we'll be active as we were in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, finally for me, we haven't talked about any accretable yield levels from CoBiz is in the last couple
quarters. Is that down to a pretty small amount that it's not even worth mentioning, or what's the CoBiz accretable
yield level nowadays?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, in the first quarter of 2021, it was $4.5 million. And this quarter, it was $3.8 million. And we have about
$38 million remaining of accretable yield that will come in over the course of couple of years, I would say.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question is from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to kind of revisit the discussion about the loan growth outlook. My
interpretation of your comments on what's in the deck kind of suggest that the outlook for the back half of the year
may be a bit more modest than you'd previously expressed. Is that a fair interpretation from what we're hearing
today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
I don't think so. I mean, I think what we're trying to communicate is that seeing stability and even some modest
growth from – in some of the months inter-quarter inside of C&I was a real positive for us. And the total loan
growth headwind was really driven by kind of specific factors inside of energy where they are – have a higher
level of cash flow than what they would have anticipated probably when they were setting their budgets and
plans, and higher level of capital markets activity within our commercial real estate portfolio.
It's hard to predict when an energy customer is going to begin to drill and quit paying down debt or when
borrowers will not use the third party or the public's nonrecourse financing markets. I think – absent those
headwinds, I think you would have begun to see some real positive growth there. We're seeing good new
customer acquisition inside of energy today, and we – we're continuing to originate a good pace inside of our
commercial real estate area. Healthcare showed a good loan growth this quarter.
And so, I think that it's just hard to tell you with great certainty what quarter is going to show the loan growth, but
the underlying activity that you would expect to see so that – that would make you think it's certainly close, we're
seeing. And I'm optimistic we're going to see that. But I don't – I can't tell you that it's going to be the third quarter
or the fourth quarter or in July. It certainly seems like we're awfully close.
And the biggest thing to me was the real core stability in those C&I balances. And in fact, we were up a little bit in
May, down a little bit in June. But very stable there, which we saw as a real positive going into the end of the
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. Thank you. And then, just on the capital front, you talked about the buyback a few minutes ago. Just in
terms of kind of the target capital ratios, can you just remind us kind of where you would like to optimize the
CET1?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I like where they are today, at that roughly 12% or a little bit lower. I don't have any kind of idea that it's
going to move lower than that. I think we have sufficient capital and continue to pay a competitive dividend to be
in the market, as I mentioned earlier, on – actively in the market on buyback. And we'll have, I think, plenty of
capital that we'll build to support loan growth that comes back. So, I don't see a pull-down in the capital ratios. I
think they stay relatively level.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to circle back on the PPP. I think you've mentioned that PPP fees in 2Q were
similar to the 1Q levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
What's the dollar amount of this? I can't find that in my notes from last...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, the first – I'm sorry. The first quarter PPP fees were $11.2 million. And in the second quarter, it was $11.1
million. The interest that we recorded, net interest revenue on the PPP dollars was $2.4 million in the first quarter
and about $1.7 million in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess, switching over to the mortgage side. I guess, in 2Q we saw it impacted by
both volume and gain on sale margin headwinds. Do you think we're in a bottom here in 2Q or you think we could
continue to bleed lower from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, there's seasonality embedded in mortgage. And so, I think third quarter tends to be a good quarter. Second
quarter and third quarter tend to be your better quarters there, and I think we'll have a better quarter in the third
quarter. I think – now, the fourth quarter would be different depending on the rate environment and there's
seasonality that moves against you a little bit in the fourth quarter there.
But I think it's – relative to second quarter, I would expect third quarter to be similar or better and, frankly, a little
bit better based on kind of what we're seeing early in the quarter and believe will transpire there. Obviously, rates
make a big difference there but we've seen some backup there in rates which will help. We've seen some
changes around the adverse fee that the agencies were charging should help. I mean, there's some things that
are creating a bit of a modest tailwind for the third quarter, in addition to some positive seasonality impacts that
will happen there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And I think the press release mentioned that the realized gain on sale margin was around 2.75%, which was
obviously higher than...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
...the 1.55%. Yeah, are you trying to signal this is more of a longer-term or more of an intermediate-term level we
should think about for our forecast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
The gain on sale margin is awfully influenced by what the pipeline looks like and whether you're building a
pipeline or whether it's net over net declining. And so, I think what we are signaling the broader is that margins
last year and early this year were much wider than what is typical for the industry. I think that everybody was
managing the pipeline, if you will, in a manner that widened the margins. I think you're seeing margins coming
down as rates began to go up. And that's what we're signaling is that margins are not where they were pre-
pandemic, but that they are moving in that direction.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe starting on asset sensitivity. If I remember
correctly, during the last cycle, BOK employed hedges to remain somewhat asset-neutral. Is that a similar
environment or a similar strategy that's going to be employed in the future raising rate cycle with the kicker just
being added liquidity in the system? Or I guess if you could just maybe provide some color on how you're
positioning the bank heading into the net rising rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, I think, as Stacy said, we were asset-sensitive coming out of the last cycle. And we don't really see
any reason to believe we'd be much different. I mean, our modeling is hard to compare to other banks, but we
think we're kind of middle of the pack, frankly.
And you'll see some numbers when we come out with our 10-Q. I don't know exactly where they'll land, but I think
we'll be somewhere around 5% asset-sensitive, and that's on our calculation and our model. I think in the last
cycle, we actually outperformed that a little bit. But I'm not predicting that will happen, but I don't see any reason
to believe that it'll be a lot different than it was coming out of the last near-zero rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
And, in fact, there's an opportunity to even outperform our strong performance last time when rates went up
because I think there's more inherent liquidity in the system today. And so, the banks overall are not going to feel
as compelled to move rates up as quickly once the Fed starts to move on short-term rates. And so, I think that will
allow the industry overall to lag deposit rates perhaps even more than they did in the last time that rates went up.
So I continue to focus on actual results because there's a near-term period where you guys can go back and look
at how did banks actually perform the last time rates went up. And I think that's a better indicator of the future than
everybody's varied assumptions around deposit modeling. And so, I think that's what I would certainly continue to
point people to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I can just have one more follow-up on the loan growth commentary. Looking
specifically at your energy customers and the confidence that balances could start heading up in the back end of
the year. I guess just given how much liquidity your borrowers have as well and the fact that energy customers
are still paying down debt and refinancing.
I guess, what gives you confidence that when the capital budgets are established later this year, that borrowers
are going to choose to lever up and borrow to drive that growth rather than digging into their own pockets for at
least the initial period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think they're savvy financial people. A modest amount of leverage can enhance the return of their capital
investment. And so, that's been the case for a long time. And so, I think that we'll – I believe that we'll begin to see

that. I mean, you look out on the hedging curve, it's backward-dated, but you can still hedge above $60 for sure
out almost three years.
And so, I think you're going to see folks begin to look at, hey, I can lock in my cash flow. I know what it's going to
cost me to drill and I know how much I'm – of that I'm going to get back in that first three years because I can
hedge at that level.
I'm very optimistic. Our energy team is exceptionally strong. There's not a bank in the US that I would trade our
team for. And we're seeing lots of opportunities there, and we're going to get our disproportionate share because
we remain very committed to this space. And it's core to who we are. It's a big part of the economic development
of our footprint states in Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma. And we have every expectation to grow energy in the
latter half of this year and into next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Then, just finally for me, more of a modeling question. But looking at trading securities balances, period-
end versus average, average balance was a couple billion higher than period-end. Can you just talk to the
dynamics there? And is that something where balances are higher during the entire year-to-quarter and then then
dip down towards the end? And how should we expect that to impact NII in the coming quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, yes, we allow those trading balances to be, on average, a little bit higher during the quarter. We did that
intentionally to take advantage of the market and allow Scott and the traders in that group to generate some
revenue. I don't think you see those average balances go up really any higher than that. I think they're around
$7.5 billion, and we're comfortable with that level.
But we always look at the market. We look at the opportunities. We look at the balance sheet, and we decide how
much capital we want to allocate towards businesses. This particular quarter, we allowed a little bit more in terms
of the balance sheet that that group could use and reap the benefit of that. So we'll evaluate that every quarter.
But I don't see it going to much higher on average than that $7.5 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. And this is Scott. So, as Steven mentioned, we finished just under $8 billion, so about $7.8 billion, and
that's versus a $7.5 billion previous quarter and it's kind of moderated since. So I think that's a level that we feel
pretty good about. I wouldn't look for that to increase as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
But I think the big takeaway from that for us is we had a really strong quarter there, and we believe that we can
sustain that in the third quarter. That, as we think about the product mix and the customers that we've added, we
think that that's a level that we can sustain into the third quarter. Now, there's some seasonality in the fourth
quarter that will impact that. But, certainly, we think we can sustain that level of revenue into the third quarter.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Steven, question for you just on how you want us to think about the provision, talking about migrating to pre-
pandemic reserve levels. Is that – are you flagging Day 1 CECL as the benchmark for us? Is there something else
going on there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's right. I mean, in that $120 million to $125 million range was pretty much Day 1 CECL, that's
kind of pre-pandemic level. So, I guess, we're using those two terms and then in the same light. I think we migrate
that direction, so long as the economy continues to improve. We're very comfortable with our credit quality, it
continues to get better. All of the metrics internally, from potential problem loans, non-accruals, classified,
criticized, all those areas continue to decline. Charge-offs are right at the lower-end of the historical levels and
don't really see any change in all of that.
So – and if you get loan growth added to it, the mix, then I do think we migrate the percentage downward. I think
we're at 1.66% on a combined reserve when you exclude PPP, and that migrates – I don't know how long that it
takes, we'll just have to see. But year, year and a half, who knows, we'll migrate that direction, we believe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. You got my next question. So, I appreciate that, that's it's open ended. But I guess, another one, we've
talked of a lot about lines of business in terms of growth. Are there any differences geographically in terms of
what you're seeing on – in terms of optimism or re-openings may be the wrong term for your geography? But any
differences that you're seeing?

No, not that they're apparent. And I think that the same dynamics that exist in Kansas City are similar to what is in
Dallas. I mean, if you think about just our geographic footprint overall, well, we've got a great footprint for long-
term economic growth. If you think about Texas and Colorado and Arizona, awfully well-positioned in those states
that are going to have disproportionate economic growth, we think, over the next 10 years. So – but in terms of
the near term, there's nothing different that we see in the markets themselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Stacy, competitive environment in energy, has that changed at all, and people really pulled back? Are you
seeing new entrants come back in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
We're not seeing a lot of new entrants at this point. I mean, all the discussion about loan growth and everybody's
seeking that. I mean, I think at some point, you're going to have some folks relook at that and come back in. But
clearly, we're seeing good opportunity for us to lead deals.
We think about energy from a lending perspective, but there's probably not another segment that we have a fuller
revenue suite than in energy where we've seen our investment banking dollars go up, our syndication revenue go
up, our hedging revenue go up. I mean, our customer portfolio is the best hedged that I've ever seen into my
career here, and they're doing a lot of that business with us.
And so, from a full business perspective, that's been a – and continues to be a wonderful business for us. We're
not seeing some of the folks who left come back yet. You may. But clearly, we're seeing opportunities and we're
being rewarded for our consistency in this space.

One last one. I hate to ask it, but it – and I ask this respectfully, but how do you guys answer the ESG question? I

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A

I mean, because there are a couple of things, most of the ESG analysis that happens today is kind of at the
corporate level. So, what are we doing from an environmental – what is BOKF doing from an environmental
perspective, not necessarily what are your customers doing; and that is where ESG is today for the most part.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
But certainly, as it evolves, there'll be more in terms of what your customers are doing. But as we think about ESG
in our relationship to energy, you think about it a couple different ways. Number one, we exist in large respect to
provide capital to help those in our state do well. So, if you think about where our footprint is, energy is a big part
of that in Colorado, Texas, and Oklahoma.
But one of the most expensive taxes on people in lower income brackets is energy. And so, an inexpensive
source of energy that exist with oil and natural gas is clearly a positive. And if you've been – and I have been – if
you've been on rigs with folks who work in the Permian or some of those areas, they hunt and fish on those same
lands that they're drilling on. They care deeply about the environment that they're drilling on.
And so, this will evolve. I think that a lot of the technology that we think about with respect to energy will also
impact carbon-based energy. So, whether it's methane capture technology or things like that, I think that – we're a

that, and we're happy to provide capital to those who help produce that for our country.
