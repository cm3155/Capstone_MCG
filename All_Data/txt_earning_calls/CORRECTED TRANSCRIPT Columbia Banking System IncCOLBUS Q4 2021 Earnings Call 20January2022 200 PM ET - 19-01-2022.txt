Thank you, Katherine. Welcome, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results, which we released yesterday after the market closed. The
earnings release and accompanying investor presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
2021 was another record year for Columbia in terms of loan production, balance sheet growth, wealth
management fees and earnings. For the first time in our history, net income exceeded $200 million, assets
surpassed $20 billion, and $2 billion of new loan originations were generated outside of the PPP program. We
closed the Bank of Commerce Holdings acquisition on October 1, and on October 12 announced our pending
combination with Umpqua Holdings. The BOCH integration has progressed as planned and will conclude during
the current quarter.
The constant theme on every earnings call over the past two years has been our commitment to remain open and
laser focused on helping our clients keep pace with the changes affecting their lives and businesses. The efforts
to which our bankers have gone to support each other, and our communities has been impressive, and it's typical

of who we are, working to build strong relationships, being innovative and growing our people is the bedrock of
our culture. And within – it was in place long before COVID-19 has guided our operations throughout the
pandemic, and it will continue to propel us as we work to meet new challenges and grow.
So, we transformed from a $21 billion company into the leading regional bank in the West. I want to thank all of
our bankers for their dedication to keeping relationships with clients and each other at the forefront. We will
continue to work hard for each other, our communities and our shareholders. On the call with me today are Aaron
Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief
Credit Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer your questions.
I do need to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on
forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release, our website or our SEC filings. At this
point, I'd like to turn the call over to Aaron.

Thank you, Clint. Full-year net income of $203 million and EPS of $2.78 included a full quarter of earnings from
our Merchants acquisition of approximately $4.3 million. Our performance was a reflection of strong growth in
loans, deposits and fee income, combined with prudent spending and strategic investment. Excluding costs
related to the Merchants' acquisition and encore combination of $14.5 million, pre-tax, pre-provision income was a
record $282 million, exceeding the prior record set in 2020 by $12 million.
Fourth quarter earnings of $42.9 million, an EPS of $0.55 were a linked quarter decrease of $10.1 million and
$0.19, respectively, mostly due to the day two provision for the Merchants' loan portfolio. Quarterly pre-tax pre-
provision earnings declined by $1.9 million to $66.7 million with the decrease attributed to $9.6 million of higher
merger-related costs and $6.3 million less interest income from the PPP portfolio, partly offset by the full quarter
earnings from Merchants' operations. Total deposits exceeded $18 billion at year-end, up $2.1 billion from
September 30 and $4.1 billion over the past year. The Merchants acquisition contributed $1.7 billion to the
sequential increase, and our cost to deposits held steady at an all-time low of just 4 basis points for both the
quarter and the year. This was down from 7 basis points for all of 2020.
The Merchants acquisition added over $800 million of liquidity to the balance sheet, propelling the investment
portfolio to $8.1 billion, with 27% held in maturity and 73% available for sale as of year-end. The securities
investment yield increased on a linked quarter basis from 1.82% to 1.98%. However, both quarters benefited from
the prepayments of interest. Absent this, the investment securities yield remained level at 1.73%. Encouragingly,
new purchases during the quarter had an average yield above this level at 1.93% and the duration of 4.5 years.
The net interest margin decreased 12 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.05%, mostly due to a decrease in
the loan yields driven by a reduction in accelerated PPP fees and partly offset by higher yields on securities due
to prepayments interest. Excluding PPP fees and prepaid interest, the net interest margin declined 1 basis point
to 2.99%. The impact to margin from the Merchants acquisition was de minimis.
For the year, the net interest margin decreased by 48 basis points due to reductions in loan and investment yields
of 30 bps and 42 bps respectively, as well as greater liquidity on the balance sheet. PPP loans added 8 basis
points to the margin in 2021, driven by $19 million of accelerated fee recognition as loans were forgiven. This
compares to 2020 when PPP loans negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points, with only $6 million of
accelerated fee recognition.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
We believe our balance sheet is very well-positioned for prospective rise in interest rates. Given its asset
sensitivity, we see significant opportunity in terms of improving yields as the Fed begins to normalize monetary
policy. Currently, $2 billion of loans within the portfolio were at their floor, and we anticipate $658 million to
increase with a single 25-basis-point rate hike. Meanwhile, our deposit costs should remain among the lowest in
the industry.
Total loans rose by $1.1 billion during the quarter to $10.6 billion, with $1 billion coming from Merchants. Adjusting
for PPP forgiveness and day one Merchants balances, loans increased $228 million or 9% annualized. New loan
production was brought on an average tax adjusted coupon rate of $357 million, which compares to the overall
portfolio, excluding PPP loans of $378 million.
Noninterest income increased $282,000 on a linked-quarter basis to $24.2 million, with $776,000 for Merchants.
For the year, noninterest income decreased by $10.4 million, but when adjusted for the [indiscernible] (00:07:31)
share gain of $16.4 million realized in the second quarter of 2020, it rose by $6 million on the strength of card
revenues, financial services and trust income.
Noninterest expense increased $12.6 million on a linked-quarter basis to $102.6 million and included $6.4 million
of new run rate expenses for Merchants and an increase in acquisition and merger expenses of $9.6 million,
offset by the $2 million recapture for unfunded loan commitments. Our noninterest expense ratio declined to
1.97% for the quarter and our operating efficiency ratio decreased 3 points to 51%.
With the addition of Merchants, we expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to be in the mid-90s range
in 2022 excluding deal costs. Expenses could start the year a little higher given seasonal factors and without the
benefit of the Merchant Systems conversion planned for late this quarter. The provision for income taxes was
down slightly linked quarter to $13.1 million, representing the 23.4% effective rate.
The higher rate stems from certain nondeductible merger costs, income earned in California, and other factors
that true-up our full year effective rate to 20.9%. We expect our 2022 effective rate to be similar to the 2021 rate.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher M. Merrywell
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron. We had strong core loan growth in the fourth quarter powered by record production. Excluding
PPP loans, quarterly production of $640 million was a new all-time fourth quarter high propelling full year
production to $2 billion for the first time in Columbia's history. Normal seasonality provided a bit of a headwind
during the quarter with line utilization falling to 43%, and we continue to refill our pipelines and they remain to our
satisfaction.
Loans ended the year at $10.6 billion, which was up $1.1 billion or 12%. And excluding the PPP portfolio, up $1.3
billion or 14% during the quarter with $1 billion attributed for Merchants. Growth in CRE led the way during the
quarter with $307 million of production predominantly with rental and leasing properties, followed by C&I
production of $199 million spread across all sectors.
During the quarter, the mortgage team originated and sold $75 million of loans with the mix 30% purchased and
70% refis. For all of 2021, $353 million of mortgages were originated and sold. The quarterly production mix was
62% fixed, 29% floating, and 9% variable. The overall portfolio now stands at 2% PPP, 53% non-PPP fixed, 30%
floating, and 15% variable.

PPP loans were $184 million at the end of the year and Merchants added $40 million, with overall payoffs during
the quarter of $171 million. At year-end, deferred fees related due to the PPP portfolio totaled $3.8 million. With
the addition of Merchants, the geographic loan distribution is now 45% Washington, 31% Oregon, 12% California,
and 5% Idaho, with the remaining 7% in other states.
We rose to number one SBA position in the Seattle district and are now the leading SBA lender in both the Seattle
and Portland districts. Going forward, we have our sights set on being the leading SBA lender in all of the
communities we serve. As was mentioned, deposits grew by $2.1 billion during the quarter, with $1.7 billion from
Merchants. The deposit mix did not change, remaining at 60% business and 40% consumer at year end. The
product mix shifted slightly from 50/50 to 49% demand and 51% interest bearing. Clint mentioned the record
setting year that our wealth management group had, nearing $16 million in revenue. This has been the
culmination of years of building internal partnerships and our focus on deepening existing client relationships. And
we are very pleased with the progress.
Now, we'll turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. The primary driver of this increase of $12.8 million in the allowance for credit losses over the
quarter to $155.6 million is the increase in the loan portfolio from the Merchant Bank of Commerce acquisition. A
day one allowance for credit loss reserve of $2.6 million was added for purchase credit deteriorated loans in the
acquired portfolio and a $16.2 million provision was added for the remaining loans. These additions were partially
offset by a more favorable economic forecast and improvement in the credit quality of the overall portfolio.
The IHS market economic forecast is more favorable than last quarter, particularly with respect to unemployment,
which is a major driver for the model. Last quarter, the unemployment rate was expected to end 2021 at 5% and
remain above pre-pandemic levels through the end of 2022. The current forecast assumes an unemployment rate
in 2021 at 4.4% and remains at or below pre-pandemic levels throughout the forecasted period. The current
forecast for GDP continues to be healthy with a full-year GDP growth expectation for 2021 remaining the same as
the forecast last quarter at 5.7%. And growth expectations for 2022 only slightly lower than the forecast last
quarter at 4.3%. Despite the continuing challenges the pandemic has been causing, our borrowers have been
able to adapt to this new environment and have shown great resilience. NPAs for the quarter improved 2 basis
points to 11 basis points and pass-through loans were only 7 basis points.
Net charge-offs annualized were 13 basis points, and our impaired capital ratio improved from 26.2% to 21.7%.
We are continuing to see credit quality improve across the whole portfolio, and on the risk rating front, loans rated
watch or worse decline from $724 million to $626 million as of year-end. Okay. Back to Clint.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Clint, maybe just to start with and not to make a big deal out of this, but the lending team announcement that you
had this week, I think it's a pretty good proxy for a group that at least was aware of the pending merger with
Umpqua. And I guess maybe the timing of those discussions or did you – as you engage with those folks prior to
the Umpqua merger? And then secondly, just – there may be kind of talk about their attraction to the platform
given the merger and how their confidence kind of going forward, if you could?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I'll share with you what I can. In terms of the timing it was post announcement. And I think it's back to some
of the things that we feel, and you probably heard from Cort and Tory in the last hour is that what we're creating is
a franchise that hasn't existed in the northwest for 25 or 30 years. And for C&I bankers they want to be in an
organization where they know that they're going to be able to meet the needs of their existing needs of their
clients, but also grow the relationship as those businesses grow.
And I think that they saw, first what our capabilities are today on a standalone basis, as well as the information we
put out with respect to the combination with Umpqua. And they got excited by it and started the conversation and
they've hit the ground running. There's – I'm not going to share any numbers with you.
But even I was very pleasantly surprised by what they have in flight right now. They're keeping Andy busy,
keeping him off the ski slopes. So, that's one aspect of it. But I also want to share with you that we've done some
other things. We added a physical presence in the Phoenix market for our National Health Care platform, and we
think that's going to be very complementary post-close to things that Umpqua is doing with the announcements
they've made with hires in that market, we'll be able to fold that in and have a more comprehensive offering in that
market.
There's other markets that we're also very actively engaged in conversations and looking at other teams that want
to be a part of what we're doing. So, more to come on that later, but I do think it's a – I think it's a testament to
people that are in our markets, that are familiar with both our organizations, Columbia and Umpqua. And they see
that back to the comment that I've said many times is that we are more similar than what the market perception
has been.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Sure. Good perspective, I appreciate it, Clint. Just to shift gears, maybe attack Aaron a bit on the expenses.
Could – any chance you could sort of lay out how that mapped in the income statement where the merger costs
were assuming legal data processing comp, but any chance you could kind of discuss where those came from on
the merger costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I can break that down for you. And I think we said in the press release, it breaks down between the two
deals with – of the total of the $11.8 million, $7.7 million is related to Merchants and the $4.1 million is to Umpqua.
But by line item, it works out to about $4.9 million is in the comp and benefits line, about $300,000 is occupancy,
another $300,000 is in data processing software, $5.6 million is legal and professional, about $100,000 in
advertising and promotion, and then about $600,000 in the other category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And then just a follow-on to your, I think your guide you mentioned looking for a mid-90s run rate on a
quarterly basis ex the Umpqua transaction, maybe a little higher in the first quarter. So you've kind of talked about
expectations for 2022. I think if you think about growth rates, I think that sets us. But if we think about cost savings
into 2023, that target of $135 million, is that – what would you peg underlying expense growth rate in 2023? I
know we're getting way out there. But safe to assume there'll be some creep on a baseline ex the targeted cost
saves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I guess, we're kind of mixed in stand-alone and combined there. But the – I think that – and you've probably heard
Ron make similar comments on an earlier call. But we are – we're very comfortable with the expense save targets
that we've laid out. Certainly, expenses, all else equal, are likely to trend higher as a result of some of the
inflationary pressures that we're obviously well aware of and have been enduring, as well as the investments in
the business that we intend to be making on a go forward basis. So there is an element of expense growth in that.
We're – our internal targets for what we can achieve are better than what we've laid out in terms of the expense-
save guidance in the deal announcement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And Jeff, this is Chris, and I'll add some color to that, and at the beginning of this year, we increased our starting
wage to $18 an hour for our non-exempt teams. And as part of that process, and you've been with us a long time,
you've heard of how we offset and we're always looking for how we can cover that additional expense. And we
were able to find that offset through some of the financial things that we had. And so we feel really confident that
we've covered that increase to our starting wage, and it won't show up in our ongoing run rate.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The – I'll follow-up with you on that, Matt. Which I think we're tracking right in line with what we expect. In fact, I
think we might actually be a little bit ahead of what we're expecting. So we're in good shape, but I don't have that
number right in front of me at the moment. I can maybe try to pull it up before the call ends.

Matthew T. Clark Q

Okay. And then just – you may have hit this during your prepared comments, and I apologize if you did, but on the
better than expected cost control this quarter, ex-merger charges held in a lot better than expected. Can you

this quarter?

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Okay. And then, on the commercial real estate growth stepped up meaningfully this quarter. Can you speak
to the underlying properties you guys are financing and where you're sourcing the growth from in terms of
customers, whether existing or new?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, it's a combination of both. And it's not straying from anything that we have typically done or looking at
owner user, as well as other types of projects that are out there as well. But nothing that falls out of moving away
from our historic portfolio and what we would normally do. But I will say, there is a good mix of existing clients as
well as, due to our approach, we continue to attract new clients from other institutions. And that's got a really
positive outlook as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, just on the loan pipeline, if you could quantify it and how it compares to last quarter or year-over-
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We're still very pleased with it. Of course, it's down slightly after a record quarter as we've had previous record
quarters. I think the piece there is while it's down slightly, we have all the confidence with what we've talked about
previously of a new team coming on and just the focus of our bankers of being external, out in the market, talking
to our clients, talking to prospects that will rebuild that. And the prospects are good for this year by all means.

Just – I'll start on the growth side, I mean, growth exceeded forecast, record fourth year originations. Digging into
the numbers, it almost looks a little bit better when you look and see that payoffs and paydowns were pretty
materially higher. Just curious whether there's just some noise in the payoffs and paydowns line from the Bank of

Commerce deal and essentially normal season – seasonal activity at the year-end or whether there's any other
trends you're seeing. Just kind of taking this into account with the improving origination activity, less loan
participations given the combination with Umpqua, does this imply that we could actually see potentially
accelerating growth just given the continued strong originations and normalizing payoffs ?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes. There's a lot in there, David. I would say, to try to pull it apart a little bit, I've been very pleased with the
activity from Merchants, or I should say the lack of payoff activity, the process that we went through and retaining
the teams, retaining Randy Eslick on the – as a leadership down there. We've held on to the clients. Many of them
are excited about the opportunity to be with a larger organization to be able to take of their needs. They don't
have to look anywhere else and that's only going to get a chance when we move forward with the Umpqua
combination.
Now, bringing it back more to our legacy piece of it, we did have a fair amount of payoffs and paydowns during
the quarter of some CRE types of transactions that building sold, things of that nature. Obviously, as you
mentioned, the good news is the teams are active and they're out, and the originations are more than offsetting
that.
I think rising interest rates, so as they materialize, we could start to see house pay-downs to be somewhat muted.
I would say, though, that I'm cautious on businesses will still sell, properties will still sell and things of that nature.
So, I think all signs are pointing in the right direction. We just have some – we have a little ways to go before we
see how it actually materializes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then just touching on deposits so getting deposit growth has remained extremely
strong, just curious how you think about deposit growth as we go forward. Do you think loan growth might start
outpacing deposit growth as we head into next year or just given the increasing contribution from C&I, would you
perhaps see outsized deposit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Deposit growth is one that we've we spent a lot of time looking at. I would love to tell you we have the exact
crystal ball that we can predict what's going to happen. I think the story there really is we've attracted the
deposits. We've attracted new clients. We haven't changed our philosophy about how we price. So, we're winning
these relationships on these deposits based on our capabilities, based on our bankers and their relationships and
the solutions that they're providing. I think that puts us in a really good position should rates start to rise, that we'll
be able to maintain kind of our historical cost of funds that we've had and how we follow that up. But I think that
what was really in there is, we have a lot of liquidity and we'll be very mindful as we start to see where the flows
go from money being spent. I would caution that all the money being spent is staying in the system and it comes
right back around into another client's account, typically.
But more importantly, I'm going to point you back to our bankers are winning business and that's bringing on new
relationships, and many of them are significant. And so, that's going to be a piece that, if we started to see some
deposits leave, I'm pretty confident we're going to continue to win that type of business and it should be able to
offset it, all things being equal, that's where I would look at that aspect.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And I'll just – David, I'll just add. With all the deposit growth that we've had and the last two years, we've done
that, and it hasn't changed what I think is some structural advantages that we have in our deposit base. Roughly
half non-interest-bearing, 60% business-oriented. And we had for 2021, again, another strong year of deposit
growth at 4 basis points for cost of funds. And so, I think that quality, high-quality deposit franchise that we've
been known for a very long period of time, it's actually been strengthened and not diluted by the growth. And so
it's a good first-world problem for us to have, which is how do we deploy that liquidity. We could have outstripped
loan growth. And so we'll see, there's a lot of activity going on. I think Chris is trying to contain his excitement
about the economic activity in our existing markets. And then the focus that we have with our Umpqua
combination and the momentum that we still have, each as separate companies and our strategy around having
the integration management office to insulate our client-facing bankers from all the integration activities. I think
we've seen that play out over the last three months. And I think we're going to see that momentum continue to
carry well into 2022 and 2023.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's a really good point, and kind of dovetails into my last question. I was hoping to get kind of an update on
how the update – on how the Umpqua merger, those discussions are going. And just whether you – I was hoping
you could provide us with a little bit of color and detail around the increase in [indiscernible] (00:33:00) office and
just some of the things that that team is working on currently to help ensure a smooth integration and, again, like
you said, preventing the disruption on the producer side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. So, Chris was in my office before the call, and we were talking about an existing client relationship that
wants to expand what they do with us significantly in anticipation of our combination with Umpqua. We also had
another conversation about some production teams. Eric Eid comes into my office and he's talking about vendor
selection, how the process for the redundant facilities or the excess facility space that we have, something like
even our HRIS system, which sounds like it's not just payroll. It's how we train and develop our people and the
integration throughout our company, and so thinking about the employee experience as we go through the
integration. So Chris is very focused on the client piece and others. It's a whole executive team. But I'm just giving
you some illustrative examples of the types of things that they're working on and how they're staying, I guess,
staying in their lane and executing on that vision of insulating the client-facing bankers from any distraction.
There's a lot of activity around planning towards the day one close. And converging processes and policies and all
of those discussions are taking place. Chris and then on the Umpqua – from the Umpqua team, Tory, they're not
totally isolated from this. They do sit on the steering committee that we have. And so, they're involved but they're
not consumed by it. I'll tell you that Eric and then his counterpart at Umpqua, Drew. They are consumed by
integration planning activities right now.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi there, Jon Arfstrom, RBC. How's everybody doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good. How are you, Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Good. Question for you Aaron, just on the margin. In the release, it feels like you're almost optimistic on the
outlook for the margin or at least less pessimistic if you set rates aside, how do you feel about just the prospect of
margin stabilization, maybe some of the puts and takes you want us to think through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're getting close. I would highlight that that in the quarter, we had a pretty good amount of what
we called prepay income on the mortgage, on the bond book. And yes, the – that was about $4.7 million. So
we've got a pretty good bump from that, that's about where we have a little bit of that each quarter. So, that was
about three times what we might ordinarily see in a quarter. So that helped in our on our investment securities
yield during the quarter. The loan yields in the quarter. If you look at where the tax adjusted coupon was ex-PPP
was $378 million and the new loans came on the book at $357 million, which was about the same level as the
prior quarter. That does bounce around quite a bit. But so – the new loans are coming on still below where the
portfolio is, so I think there's still a likelihood for some pressure there. But I think that we're getting closer to a
bottom or inflection point. And I think very importantly, obviously, the tone around the likelihood of rate hikes,
we've already seen it exhibited in the – at the longer end of the curve, the tenure is up prematurely over the past
quarter. And we're seeing that too in our new bond purchases already. And hopefully, we'll start seeing that in –
on the loan side as well, though that's likely to take a little longer and we could ultimately see a little bit of slight
compression before the real benefit of higher rate hikes materialize.
But we, obviously, have a fantastic funding base, but the balance sheet is very asset sensitive. We have really
good disclosure in the deck. I would point you to actually a new slide that we put in. It's slide 16...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Slide 16.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
...investor presentation because it's – we've historically presented a pretty conservative picture in terms of our
betas but – and what's assumed in our interest rate sensitivity. And so, we provided some additional beta levels
going down as low as 15, which even still is above the beta that we exhibited during the last repricing cycle.
So, I think that will give you a better picture of just how powerful higher rates can be to our net interest income as
we hopefully get the benefit of that.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. I was just going to – you answered my follow-up on that because it just feels like maybe your deposit base,
like others, is a little bit different at this point than the last cycle.
And I'd probably take the bet on lower betas at least early on, but I think that's good information.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:39:29). And also, it has – to go back to Clint's earlier comment too about the strength of our
noninterest-bearing deposits and how our clientele is truly differentiated with our commercial focus, are – the
percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits, the total – percentage of the total increase during the last great rising
cycle, and there's not a lot of institutions to concur that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Andy, one for you on the provision, it looks like absent Bank of Commerce, we would have had
another negative provision or reserve release. How do you – how are you feeling about overall credit and there's
anything that you would call out other than growth that would impact the provisioning going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Your conclusion is correct. We would have had a release. Obviously, we're feeling pretty good with where
the portfolio stands. We enjoyed a lot of healing during the quarter as well as during the year. I think that the
economic forecast is beginning to stabilize. And as you know, CECL is very dependent on the economic forecast
that you used.
So as that stabilizes, it'll create less volatility in the model. And I think that the provision will become much more
stable as well quarter-to-quarter. So in general, I feel good about credit quality, and I feel optimistic about the
levels of provisioning that we would have to do even given growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Thanks, everyone. That's all I had.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.

for closing remarks.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Actually, before we go. I just want to respond to Matthew Clark's question on the cost saves on the merchant
steel. Year-to-date, we have realized $2.3 million annualized in terms of the cost saves. By the end of this quarter,
I think we should be around [indiscernible] (00:41:49) about 80%. 80 – a little over 80% of what we've targeted.
And at this point, our expectation is that we do better than target on a cost saves. So we're tracking as expected
and looking good on that front. I'll turn it over to Clint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
