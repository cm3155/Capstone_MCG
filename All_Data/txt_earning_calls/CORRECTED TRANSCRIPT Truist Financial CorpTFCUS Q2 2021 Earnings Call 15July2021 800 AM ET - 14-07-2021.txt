Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ankur, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We really appreciate your support. So, it's a really strong
quarter, which reflects our diverse business mix, our consistent risk management. We did have a negative
provision. And importantly, I would point out investments that we have made in insurance, investment banking,
wealth and digital capabilities, and excellent progress in our conversion.
As you've heard us say before, we believe culture continues to be the primary driver of our success. I will point
out that, today, in these times, our purpose really resonates with teammates and others as our purpose of
inspiring and building better lives and communities is motivational and satisfying to our teammates being involved
and helping make the world a better place.
We're now focused, you may be interested, in knowing and helping each of our teammates align with our culture
on a personal basis because we find that engagement really excels when people are aligned with a personal
purpose and a cultural purpose. Our EO team is highly focused on cultural integration and activation, and is a
primary focus for all of us.
If you're following the slides, if you look on slide 5, just want to point out that, for us, purpose is not just a banner.
It's the way we live. It's truly trying to inspire and build better lives and communities. We focused a lot of attention
especially now and increasing on DEI. I would point out some of the major investments we're making in our
communities.
Example, this quarter, we contributed a combined $200 million to the Truist Foundation and the Truist Charitable
Fund to support important work of our organizations across our diverse markets and communities. We're very
excited that we were able to invest $22 million in Atlanta's Mercy Care, which is a fantastic federally qualified
health care for homeless program. We expanded our partnership with Operation HOPE with a $20 million
investment to help provide more education, insights and tools to help more people build better lives. And we
invested $2.5 million in a grant to the National Institute for Student Success to improve the financial education and
graduation rates for underserved students. This is a fantastic program.
But it's not just about philanthropy. It's about the way we live around here every day. So, I'm very proud that we
released our inaugural Supplier Diversity Impact Report, which outlined a $1 billion total economic impact through
supplier diversity relationships in 2020. We're at 114% prorated on our goal for our three-year $60 billion
Community Benefit Plan, which is really helping our communities. And through second quarter 2021, we've
originated about $17 billion of PPP loans, which really have supported our business clients and employees and
our communities.
We're very active and increasing our engagement with regard to ESG. Very focused on energy and sustainable
related financing where, in the second quarter, continuing from 2020, we've invested $2.4 billion in clean energy

and sustainable related financing. Look forward soon in the next few weeks for the second Truist CSR and ESG
Report, which I think you will enjoy.
So, now, if you'll flip with us to slide 7, I just want to point out some of the key performance highlights. With a very
strong quarter, we had taxable equivalent revenue of $5.6 billion, which was up a strong 4% sequentially from first
quarter. We had $5.6 billion in taxable equivalent â€“ we had the revenue. And net income was $2.1 billion, which
was up 30% linked. Very proud of our $1.55 diluted EPS, which was up 31% sequentially and a strong 89% over
last year. Return on average tangible common equity adjusted was a very strong 24.7%. But even if you take out
the reserve release, it's still a really, really strong 20.9%, which is driven by strong performance in insurance,
investment banking, wealth, card and payment fees and our commercial real estate related income.
We had strong performance in terms of revenue. As I said, it did drive a 2% increase in adjusted non-interest
expenses due to incentives. But frankly, this is exactly the kind of expense increase we like to have. When you
put that together, revenue and expenses, we had a solid adjusted operating leverage of 2% and our adjusted
PPNR was $2.5 billion, up 6% compared to last quarter.
Our asset quality is great. We performed well in CCAR, which allowed us to be in a position to propose a 7%
increase in our dividend. We record $0.48 per quarter. Our merger integration is going very, very well. And top
performance and improved economic conditions give us confidence to reduce our CET1 target to 9.75%. And
Daryl will talk more about that. So, our total performance for the quarter we think was very, very strong and very
comprehensive, which we feel very, very good about.
If you flip with us to slide 8, I just want to point out a few of the selected items that impacted adjusted income.
First, we had merger-related and restructuring charges of $297 million, $228 million after-tax, which was a diluted
impact of $0.17. Incremental operating expenses related to the merger, I'll point out again, these are merger-
related expenses, but don't meet the technical definition of merger-related and restructuring charges, but they are
not in our run rate going forward. That's $190 million, $146 million, again, after-tax, and $0.11 diluted negative
impact. As I mentioned, we did have a $200 million contribution to our Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable
Fund, which had an $0.11 impact.
I would point out in the merger-related and restructuring charges, included in that is a $111 million after-tax
accrual related to our voluntary separation and retirement program, which was a program that we offered in June.
We had approximate 2,000 teammates that elected to participate. These were totally voluntary decisions on their
part, and I want to really thank and appreciate those teammates for their commitment and support to help us build
a foundation of Truist. This program does help us reduce cost and create capacity to invest in needed services for
our clients. It's really part of our overall intense focus on reconceptualizing our businesses. To thrive in today's
world requires a deep commitment to continuously reevaluating yesterday's activities and expenses associated
with that so that we can afford to invest in new activities for today's demands.
With that, let me turn it to Bill to talk about some [indiscernible] (00:09:07) our key trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr.
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everybody. As you can see on slide 9, we continue to experience robust
demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and more effective ways to transact
and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid and mobile. Since the second
quarter of 2020, our active user base has increased by 9% to over 4.1 million active clients.

[ph] Beyond the (00:09:36) digital growth stories, it's a lot more than that. It isn't just one dimensional. In addition
to growing active users, we're deepening our relationships as we accompany clients along their digital journey. By
providing the premier digital experience, we build trust with our clients. They then entrust us to facilitate a broader
range of transactions. A great example of this is in mobile payments where Zelle transactions were up 60%
compared to a year ago.
We're also excited about the rollout of our new digital experience that's beginning now ahead of our physical
conversion. After completing a successful internal pilot, we're beginning to migrate the Truist digital offering to a
small number of clients. Rollout will happen in a series of waves throughout the back half of the year. We
anticipate that up to 0.5 million clients could be on the digital platform by the end of this month, with more to be
added in each successive wave.
On the right, you can see just one example of how we're using digital to meet clients where they are in the small
business space. A single sign-on focus for clients with personal and business accounts is a significant benefit,
allowing our small business clients to toggle back and forth seamlessly between their business and personal
finances. Our clients will also be able to customize their dashboard and notifications so they can focus on what
matters to them.
In addition, our fraud detection technology will help small business clients with fraudulent transactions for a more
secure banking experience. The attractiveness of our overall approach is that we've created a common platform
for retail, wealth and small business, which creates agility and a seamless client experiences, but the experiences
are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment.
Now allow me move to slide 10. [indiscernible] (00:11:29) loan growth remained challenging in the second quarter
given strong liquidity levels in the marketplace and amongst our clients. Supply chain disruptions and low levels of
rates which are driving high levels of refinance activity. Average loans decreased $6.1 billion compared to the first
quarter, driven by $3.3 billion decline in commercial loans and a $2.2 billion decline in residential mortgages.
Average C&I balances decreased $2.4 billion, reflecting a $1.3 billion impact from PPP forgiveness and $1.2
billion from lower dealer floor plan outstandings. Nevertheless, we're encouraged about potential green shoots in
C&I.
Excluding the impacts of PPP and dealer floor plan, C&I loans grew modestly due to an increase in production
and stable utilization late in the quarter. Several of our markets in specialty saw growth, particularly middle
market. June production in corporate institutional group was the highest it's been since the merger. And June
production in the commercial community bank was the highest it's been in 18 months, if you exclude April 2020,
which was obviously unusual due to elevated line draws.
Our revolver exposure continued to grow by month, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building
capacity for investments or expansion. Average consumer loans decreased $2.7 billion as a result of ongoing
refinance activity in our residential mortgage and home equity and direct portfolios. Residential mortgages held for
investment decreased $2.2 billion as prepayment speeds remained elevated despite some moderation from first
quarter levels. We're expanding our correspondent capacity and transferring some correspondent production to
held for investment to support future growth. We also believe prepayment speeds will continue to moderate.
Indirect remains a bright spot due to growth in our prime, marine, RV portfolios and LightStream.
Overall, loan growth remained elusive in the second quarter both for the industry and for Truist. As indicated
earlier, though, we're seeing evidence of things beginning to turn and our execution is improving at Truist with a
keen focus on balance sheet diversity and prudent risk management. Long-term, loan growth is an output and

highly correlated to economic growth, and we firmly believe the economy particularly in our key markets is on a
very solid footing and on an expansion trajectory.
Allow me turn to slide 11. Average deposits increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter, largely due to the
continuing effects of recent government stimulus. We experienced strong deposit inflows while maximizing our
value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as average total deposit cost decreased 1 basis point sequentially
to 4 basis points. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with clients.
During the second quarter, we had a record personal checking account production and added more than 51,000
net new accounts, which attest to the strength of our franchise. We also do an excellent job retaining clients as
attrition rates from recently closed branches continue to be significantly more favorable than planned. We believe
these favorable client dynamics reflect our robust markets, strong digital commerce production and solid
execution by our teammates in the retail community bank.
And with that, Daryl, let me turn it over to you for our financial performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Continuing on slide 12. Net interest income decreased $40 million
largely due to $32 million lower purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points.
Lower purchase accounting accretion was 4 basis points headwind. Core net interest margin decreased 9 basis
points due to the continued build of excess liquidity, which was approximately $18 billion this quarter as well as
the impact of persistent low rate environment. Asset sensitivity increased modestly due to the increase in DDA
and the favorable deposit mix changes, partially offset by the increase in the investment portfolio. I would also
note almost 60% of our asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve, giving us solid upside when short-term
rates begin to rise.
Continuing on slide 13. Our diverse business mix is a key strength and continues to provide revenue momentum
in a low rate environment. Adjusted non-interest income grew 11% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, driven
by record results in multiple fee businesses. Insurance income was a record $690 million, driven by a strong
organic growth in new business, excellent retention rates, and a firm pricing market. Organic revenue grew 15%
versus a COVID-impacted like quarter and we continue to forecast very healthy organic growth. Given the various
uncertainties that exist in the marketplace, this is clearly a good time to be in a business that helps clients
manage risk.
Fee income from investment banking reflected strong results in syndicated finance and M&A while trading income
was offset by $60 million swing in the CVA. We have been consistently investing in and building our corporate
and investment banking business for over 15 years, and this quarter's results are a reflection of that. Record CRE
income was driven by strong structured real estate transaction activity. Our strong performance is also a
testament to the CRE team's experience and deep client relationships.
Other income benefited from valuation gains on our longstanding partnerships related to our SBIC funds and also
investments we've made through our Truist Ventures unit. When small businesses win, our communities win. So,
we are thrilled with the success we have had over many years with our SBIC program.
Continuing on slide 14. Interest expense increased $401 million from the prior quarter. Drivers included a $200
million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation and Truist Charitable Fund to support our purpose to
inspire and build better lives and communities. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges and
6

incremental operating expenses increased $171 million, largely due to the voluntary separation and retirement
program that Kelly mentioned earlier. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2.1%, modestly due to higher
variable compensation related to the stronger performance of our fee businesses and overall strong corporate
performance. Adjusted non-interest expense was also favorable relative to adjusted revenue growth, driving
sequential positive operating leverage this quarter.
Turning to slide 15. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio as well
as a stronger economy. Non-performing assets decreased 2 basis points. Net charge-offs decreased 13 basis
points to 20 basis points, a pro forma post-financial crisis low. Lower charge-offs reflect improvements in our
indirect auto and C&I portfolios as well as an uptick in recoveries. Our ALLL remained strong at 1.79% with
excellent coverage ratios. Due to the improved economic outlook, our provision was a negative $434 million and
released $560 million of reserves.
Continuing on slide 16. Capital remained strong. Our CET ratio increased to 10.2%. Our total payout ratio was
78% and included $610 million of share repurchases. We continue to optimize our capital stack by redeeming our
Series H preferred stock. Our latest CCAR results reflect our prudent risk management and resiliency under
stress. Truist had the second lowest loss rate in our peer group as well as above average stress PPNR relative to
peers. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was reduced to 2.5% from 2.7%. Our strong CCAR results, improving
economy and merger progress provide additional capital flexibility. Our board will consider proposal to increase
the dividend by 7% to $0.48 per share in its July meeting. We also intend to manage to approximately 9.75%
CET1 ratio over the near term, which will reflect approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of potential capital
deployment, either through repurchases or acquisitions, over the next five quarters.
Turning to slide 18. We are making steady progress in our integration plan and our risk profile improves with each
conversion. During the second quarter, we successfully converted our wealth trust platform. We are very proud of
our wealth, digital and technology teammates for their hard work in completing this conversion and brokerage
platform conversion in February. More impressively, our advisors continue to produce positive net organic asset
flows, which combined with strong market conditions produced excellent results in wealth management fee
income. We also performed extensive testing to prepare for the upcoming core bank conversions.
After each milestone, we reflect on what we've learned, apply those learnings to the future integration activities.
This reduces the risk and helps us ensure we get better with each step of the integration. As you look to the third
quarter, much of our focus will be on the final preparations for the conversion of our heritage BB&T clients to the
Truist ecosystem later this year. This will be followed by heritage SunTrust conversion in the first quarter of 2022.
Continuing on slide 19. We are committed to achieving $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make
progress across those five categories. Third-party spend is down 10.3% versus the baseline and now exceeds
our revised target of 10%. In retail banking, we remain at 374 cumulative branch closures and are on track to
achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022, including 39 closures we are expecting in
July.
Non-branch facility space is down 3.8 million square feet and we're closing in on our target of 4.8 million. We
appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track to achieve these goals. Average FTEs
decreased 11% since the merger announcement and would decline even further given the VSRP program.
Technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We are also making
critical investments in digital and technology. Since the merger closed, we have doubled our digital agile teams
7


Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
and tripled our total agile teams, which makes us nimbler and improves our speed to market, enhancing our client
experience.
Turning to slide 20. We still expect to incur total merger costs of approximately $4 billion through 2022. We have
incurred cumulative merger costs of $2.7 billion through the second quarter, reflecting considerable integration
work on slide 18. Looking ahead, we expect these costs to decrease significantly after our first quarter core bank
conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022.
Continuing on slide 21. Our core non-interest expense was $2.952 billion in the second quarter. This calculation
removes the effects from asset value changes for our retirement plans, our insurance acquisitions, and higher
variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance. This makes it much more comparable to
the baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Based on the trajectory of our ongoing cost save initiatives,
we are on track to achieve our fourth quarter core expense target of $2.94 billion. We are fully committed to this
target and we are confident in our ability to meet it.
Now, I'd provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total net interest income to be relatively stable versus
linked quarter, as one additional day combined with moderate loan growth excluding PPP offsets declines in
purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue. Core net interest margin is expected to be relatively stable.
However, reported net interest margin will continue to decline as a result of diminishing purchase accounting
accretion. Fees should remain healthy, given investments we've made in our businesses, robust market
conditions, and continued economic recovery. It will not be as strong as second quarter performance. This is
partially due to insurance seasonality, but we would expect solid growth compared to third quarter of last year.
Adjusted expenses should be relatively flat linked quarter, but would decline in fourth quarter as lower personnel
costs are realized from the VSRP program. We expect the net charge-off ratio to be 25 basis points to 35 basis
points, given the continued strength in the economy. Also, if the strong credit quality performance continues, we
would expect further reductions in our loan loss allowance ratio.
Overall, we had excellent operating quarter as strong fee income more than offset modest lower spread income
and outpaced expenses to drive 2% sequential operating leverage.
Now, let me hand it over to Kelly to discuss our value proposition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Just to make a couple comments with regard to our value proposition this quarter focusing on our markets and
capital. We are really very, very pleased that 70% of our net new accounts are opened by new households. We
think this shows market share gains and migration in our markets and our digital advantage as about half of our
new accounts are opened online. All of this interestingly is happening in the face of large number of branch
closures that Daryl described where our client retention is a very strong 98-plus percent, which is really fantastic
in any type of merger.
As mentioned, our CCAR performance, our lowered risk in the economy, reduced risk in our conversion process,
which Daryl discussed, gives us great confidence to propose a meaningful increase in our dividend to a record
$0.48 and reduce our target CET1 to 9.75%. Just wanted to emphasize that again to make sure you get that
because that's important.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
We also are very confident in achieving, as Daryl said, our $1.6 billion net cost saves based on a number of
initiatives that are driving the reconceptualization of our business, expense reductions and our industry-leading
profitability. We believe that the combination of that will support our investments in future strategies and leading
technology investments.
Then, finally, if you'd just flip to slide 23, just want to make a couple of points that how the metrics and numbers
support that value proposition. As we said before, we have a really exceptional franchise. We have the highest
projected population growth compared to our peers and our marketplaces. We have really good fee income
diversity with our investments in insurance, investment banking and wealth. We are really uniquely positioned
from a profitability perspective with our adjusted diluted EPS at $1.55, up $0.89, adjusted return on average
tangible common equity at a strong 24.7%. And we have strong capital, as Daryl described, as well.
So, if you look at the quarter overall, it was a strong quarter based on a strong culture. Great markets, awesome
team. There are plenty of challenges out there. The pandemic is getting better. The economy is getting better.
And overall, at Truist, we fully believe our best days are ahead.
Ankur, let me turn it back to you.

Thank you, Kelly. Before we move to Q&A, though, I'd like to quickly turn it to Bill who'd like to share a few
concluding thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr.
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
I might make you feel a little uncomfortable, but â€“ so bear with me. So, given this is Kelly's last and 50th earnings
call as CEO, I just want to spend a few minutes highlighting his legacy. Just incredible positive impact on BB&T,
Truist, the banking industry and our communities during his 49-year career in banking. I could take hours to do
this, but I won't, given that we only have a few minutes, but I thought this group of analysts and investors would
appreciate who've followed his career.
Kelly joined BB&T in 1972 and I thought it was great irony that earlier this week he spoke to our leadership
development program, individuals and teammates who joined just the same way you did, Kelly. When he speaks
about the benefits of a growth mindset, positive thinking, choosing to be happy and seeing opportunities and
change, just like he just did, he speaks from his personal experience and his heart. Kelly's humble roots give him
a genuine appreciation for all people. They've driven his Seeds of Hope initiative and played a key role in our
value of caring, which says every one and every moment matters. He's also the driving force with our happiness
value. Positive energy changes lives. And he exhibits that daily for our teammates and for our clients.
Kelly became CEO in 2009 in the depths of the global financial crisis. BB&T was one of the few banks to remain
profitable through every quarter through that crisis. When he began at BB&T, it was a small bank in Eastern North
Carolina with about $250 million in assets. When he became CEO, the bank had $152 billion in assets and today
Truist has $520 billion in assets. Market cap is four times during his tenure.
Always a forward thinker, Kelly is a purpose-driven leader who steered BB&T through tremendous change, not
just to survive, but to thrive through the Great Recession, multiple economic downturns, and now through a global
pandemic and our merger of equals. In addition to traversing tumultuous business headwinds, I admire he's never

lost sight of his personal purpose, which is to make a positive meaningful difference in the lives of as many people
as possible. His empathy, compassion and leadership had tremendous impact on just to name, in fairness, a few:
financial education for more than 1 million high school students through the Truist Financial Foundations;
childhood literacy which is a passion of his through a new reading app called [ph] Word4Us (00:31:17), which is
just getting started; community service through the Lighthouse Project, positively impacting the lives of more than
20 million people since its inception in 2009.
Kelly has always had an interest in and a commitment to leadership development. It's the foundation for the Truist
Leadership Institute in Greensboro. Many of you have been there. It has been renamed The Kelly S. King Center
in his honor. It not only trains executives to become better and more self-aware leaders, but it also offers
customized training at no cost for principals and have certified many, many students at no cost through our
Emerging Leaders curriculum, which is provided in partnership with over 80 colleges and universities.
Kelly is known for saying there's no facet of society that cannot be improved through better leadership. Before our
merger, I knew Kelly well. I also listen to these calls, Kelly. Many of your 50 calls. We joined forces with a concept
that we could truly build a purposeful company that stood for something better and outperform with consistency
over the long term. Kelly, you were the perfect leader to start us on that journey. Your inspirational leadership was
a positive catalyst for all of you.
So, with a heartfelt thank you for your leadership, your contributions to Truist, to our industry and personally for
our friendship. I look forward to our continued partnership and collaboration with you going forward as you
transition to the role of Executive Chair for our board of directors.
So, now we can turn it over to Q&A. Kelly, thank you.

I did just want to note that this is also Daryl's 50th conference call. So, congratulations to Daryl. But thank you,
Bill, for that. I just wanted to say to our audience that has supported us over all these years, it has been an honor
and a blessing to have worked with thousands of Truist teammates over all these years to serve our communities.
And I really, really cherish that opportunity.
I'll also just say to all of us that banking is an honorable profession, which serves to help build better lives and
communities every single day. I am humbled and proud to have been a part of it. Thank you for your support. We
appreciate it. And as I've said many times, I truly believe our best days are ahead.

Good morning, Kelly. Good morning, Bill.

Hi, Gerard.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
To start off, on behalf of many on this call, Kelly, I would also reiterate Bill's fabulous comments about your career
and congratulate you on being an outstanding community, spiritual, and commercial bank leader. I think you will
be missed by many. So, congratulations.
On questions, maybe starting with you, Bill, can you give us some further color or elaborate on the green shoots
that you guys are seeing in the loan growth area for possibly the second half of the year? Daryl touched on it as
well. And where you're seeing some of this potential growth coming from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Gerard. As I mentioned, production in June in CIG and CCB was sort of hitting some high point. So,
we started to see a little bit of an inflection point. In CIG, a lot of that came from industrials, healthcare, tech that
probably doesn't surprise you. I mean, I think as we think about the infrastructure that's ahead of us, I think
energy is a potential for the future. I'll put that a little bit a question mark. That's probably the light green of a green
shoot. And CCB, really good progress in our middle market, a lot in our verticals. Senior care, I think that's really
coming back strong. Our dealer network. So, despite the outstandings, our exposure to dealer is going up and
then just sort of our government services. Again, I don't think those are surprises. Those are probably core parts
of our economy.
Overall, revolver commitments were up. So, as I said earlier, I think the capacity of our clients to invest. When this
will come, I think that's sort of a question. I don't think it's an if. I feel like we're in a good position, whether that
manifests itself so much in the second quarter. Remember, we still have some headwinds with PPP. But our
tailwinds, I think the dealer part will rebound. I mean, you'll see the supply chain start to normalize, whether that
happens at the end of this year or first of next year, I don't know, but that will rebound. The economy particularly
and our markets utilization and just, as Kelly mentioned, our just core execution just gets better every day. So, I
think those are tailwinds.

Very good.

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Gerard, if I may add. Bill and I and others have been on our regional visits virtually so far this year. And
we've talked I guess, Bill, to hundreds of offshore business clients and the feedback, and I think it's a really big
deal, universally, has been extremely confident and positive. They're all talking about projects that they're working
on. It is, as Bill described, beginning to show up in green shoots. I personally think it will really begin to show up
as we head into the third and fourth quarter and certainly under guard a strong 2022. But the confidence level is
very, very high.

Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Gerard, this is Chris. I might just add that we had 16 of our 22 regions that were actually positive in C&I growth
less dealer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And maybe shifting over to Daryl. You talked a little bit, Daryl, about the possibility of bringing the loan
loss reserve down. You mentioned that in the DFAST test you're the second best in terms of the â€“ on the credit
losses. I see, if I recall, your day one reserves back in January of 2020 were 1.61%. Can you give us maybe
some color and maybe Clark as well about the outlook that could that reserve level fall below the day one, now
that the outlook might be even stronger today than it was in January of 2020, excluding the pandemic situation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gerard. What I would tell you is, is that when we established our CECL day one
number, we weighted our pessimistic scenario of 40%. I mean, if you look at the economy now and the growth
that we're seeing and the outlook, our weighting is much less than that. So, as the economy plays out throughout
this year, there is a chance that we could pierce through and maybe go over or go under our CECL day one
number that we started with in January of 2020 from that perspective. I think you have to take it quarter-by-quarter
and see how it's performing. But right now, the economy seems to be going on really strong and any momentum.

Hi. You don't have revenue synergies built in your final numbers, but it seems like you might have some revenue
synergies here. So, specifically I'm asking of the record in insurance and of the record in investment banking, how
12

much of those revenues are driven by cross-selling versus just the core organic growth? And I have my insurance
analyst colleague at Wells Fargo Securities to ask on that second part. Elyse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elyse Greenspan Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Go ahead.

Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
No. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elyse Greenspan Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I was just going to build upon my question on the insurance side, just hoping â€“ you guys had an impressive
organic growth quarter, hoping to get an update on your outlook for the rest of the year, how things can trend
versus the 15% this quarter [indiscernible] (00:40:28) within retail and wholesale [indiscernible] (00:40:31)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
All right. I'd be happy to do that. Maybe Bill and I'll take the IRM question first and then I'll jump back and answer
your question, Elyse. From the IRM perspective, I will tell you it is going really well. We have been for the past 18
months in the behavior building kind of phase. When I look at this quarter, I see very strong contributions from the
commercial community bank to our strategic side, which is the CIG for capital market services, I see a very strong
up 20% in a growth perspective, I see mortgage up in the mid-30s. And CIG, which is back to insurance and to a
few other areas, up well over 100% in terms of growth.
In fairness, we have some other areas that have some opportunity, but I like what I see and I think what we're
building really is the right foundation for a behavioral jumping off point across the company. It is something that
Bill and I have been personally monitoring and working with each one of the business lines. And we're in kind of
still of a build-out process from terms of understanding sort of what's possible. And we're really trying to push our
line of business leaders to think bigger because we think the opportunity is very substantial. And Bill, I don't know
if there's anything you want to add to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think Chris said it exactly right. And remember, Mike, I mean, these cut across a lot of different parts and
we like to think about the term of integrated relationship management so that it cuts across clients and we're
meeting client's needs and working backwards. But just I'll give an example sort of in the commercial community
bank, we've doubled the number of transactions that we did in the quarter versus last quarter. And these might be
where we were Left Lead, this might be where we were in M&A transaction, and the pipeline is also about double
where it was before. So, as a percent of the growth â€“ as a percent of the total, it's a smaller percent. As a percent
of the incremental growth, it's a larger percent. And I think that's going to continue to grow the momentum, the
cultural alignment, all the parts that we built as part of One Truist I just feel â€“ I feel great about it and I think that
momentum will continue. And you'll see it in just â€“ the way I think you'll see it is versus revenue synergies
specifically, what you'll see is incremental growth relative to [ph] uppers (00:43:10).

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And so, coming back, Elyse, to your question, and I just preface this with comments that we took sort of a
white sheet of paper to this business back in early 2018 brought in a consultant and really begin to break the
business down and look at all the opportunities to put the pieces back together. And I think what you're seeing
here is a three-year â€“ end of a three-year period of where we have really taken a lot of steps to build back a
business in the most effective way possible in a really good operating environment. So, I would have to say this is
fundamentally the best quarter I have seen in this business in my career, and I've been working in this business a
long time. And we are, by the way, cranking off as we conclude the first three-year period. We're kicking off
another three-year period because we think there's more that we can do and will do to improve this business.
But to get to your question, what's really driving organic growth is, as you know, pricing in the industry I think
probably peaked in the fourth quarter of 2020 or first quarter this year, it was sort of in the up 7% range where,
now if you read all the industry information coming up, call it, 6% kind of range. But we really believe while rates
have moderated a little, we believe that it's still going to be very positive throughout the balance of 2021. You
might have potential for a little slight moderation, but we still think it's very strong in the up category, in the up mid-
5% to 6% kind of category. And we just entered hurricane season, by the way, and the fall was wildfire season, so
you never know. It could just hold or even increase from there, depending on what happens.
Our client retention in retail is at 91.8%, and that's up 1% over the last year. And in a hard market environment, it
favors wholesale more. That is very much a positive. Our wholesale business is 86.1%. It's up 2%, also very
strong. But we are continuing to see risk shift from the standard market that supports retail to wholesale. Probably
the most notable driver of organic growth was just our new business production and that is driven just by core
GDP growth. And so, we're in the up portion of the V right now from an economic perspective. And so, 24.5% new
business growth is double the best I've seen historically. Year to date, we're up 19%. So, we get organic growth
rate â€“ total growth rate of 18.8%; but when you strip out acquisitions, organic of 14.8%.
We are including in this quarter $29 million of revenue from prior acquisitions. That does not include Constellation,
which we just closed on July 1. But it includes, if you look at annual run rate, it's about $130 million of prior
acquisitions we did through a number of seven or eight through the back half of last year and the first part of this
year. So that's sort of the organic growth question.
But to get to your outlook question, just remember, we are going from our seasonally strongest quarter of the year
to our seasonally weakest quarter from second to third. So, we expect commissions to be down about 8% going
from second to third. And there's still certainly uncertainties, but we just think the environment looking forward is
still very favorable when you think of improvement in the economy with a GDP and improving employment which
really drives our EB business, increasing pricing as we just said and up sort of 6% range and then we benefit from
the shift to the E&S market via our very strong wholesale business. That's why we operate a diversified model
quite frankly.
We think pricing is going to continue to be strong. You see sort of the drivers in the industry this quarter umbrella
in excess is up 11.6%, D&O is up 11%, commercial property, which we have a disproportionate exposure to, is up
9.6%, that's really good for us. So, we expect for the third quarter high single-digit organic growth in our weakest
quarter. That would be the highest growth that I've seen historically. Period. But we're expecting high single-digit
growth in our weakest quarter, which I think is fantastic for the business.
And just remember, we did close Constellation July 1 and that adds $160 million in revenue and really helps us
form one of the largest programs divisions in wholesale units of any wholesale provider going forward.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Chris, just a quick follow-up on that. The $160 million is additive, so your 8% QQ is not including that
acquisition. Just want to clarify that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, it is in our forecast. So, what you're typically seeing â€“ I mean, last year, you'd have seen second to
third, we would drop maybe $75 million. This year, you would have seen a $90 million drop. But with the addition
of this number, you'd see something like a $50 million because you've got $160 million annually.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

there to note out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
There's expense synergies. So, this business, actually, the margin is accretive to our overall margin. So, I think

Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And generally, Betsy â€“ generally, it's about a 12-month integration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. No, you've done a great job at improving the operating efficiency of that business over the past several
years. So, congratulations to you on that. I did have a couple other questions. First off, imitation is often the best
form of flattery, and there's plenty of people imitating you on your specialty finance lending focus that has been a
hallmark of TFC for many decades. Could you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that business and
where you want to be leaning into growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Absolutely, Betsy. And thank you for saying that. That has been a focus of ours. We really think of it in terms of
point-of-sale. And when we talk about insurance in wealth and CIG, we probably should add sort of a point-of-sale
focus through our core Sheffield and we also have LightStream now, we have a group of partnerships that are a
little bit more indirect.
Things have clearly changed with our consumers. They no longer come to their bank to purchase their items.
They buy it on the spot and they want it just that way. And now, they want it digitally just that way as well. So,
we're working on all the above. And I think we have opportunities within our current business to expand verticals
like hearing aids and do more in the way of trailers and that kind of thing. So, there are opportunities there. But I
think we're also looking at other opportunities to expand like in the home improvement space would be a good
place. There's a lot going on there. So, it's an area we're really focused on and something that we're really excited
about. And it's an industry that has in the north of 20% kind of growth rate. So, we're very excited about the
opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, Daryl, just a couple for you. One, ticky-tacky one is just on the fees you mentioned down
sequentially. We talked about the insurance seasonality, but up year-on-year. Could you just remind us what kind
of base level fees you're looking at year-on-year? Cause I thought there was some one-timers in it last year. I just
want to make sure I'm on the right base.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
If you look at it versus prior year, we'll probably be up anywhere from 5% to 10% range in that neighborhood. We
did have some other income in there from our venture capital portfolios there. But to be honest with you, we
continue to invest in that, and that continues to be part of run rate as we move forward. So, it's going to be lumpy
back and forth, but it is going to be continuing to grow over time from that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just on the NCO ratio guide of the 25 to 35 basis points, I think you came
in this quarter around 20 basis points or so and credit looks great. So, is this you being conservative with the 25,
35 basis points, or is there something in the book that you would suggest you're expecting a little bit of a
deterioration Q2 on the ratio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Betsy, this is Clark. It's primarily seasonality. In the second half of the year, we always have some seasonality
uptick in some of the consumer portfolio. So, we're assuming we'll have some of that normal trend. And I would
just also say this was an outstanding quarter. We did have all-time lows in our things like our auto business. We
had really low C&I and higher recovery. So, we had some really strong tailwinds this quarter. But all that being
said, we still feel like we're going to have very strong loss performance as we move forward given what we see
today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. And Kelly, it's been phenomenal working with you over the past several decades.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just want to circle back on the expense target for 4Q, the $2.94 billion. I guess, first a
clarification. Does that include the impact of the insurance deals or I would assume we got to top it up for the one
that just closed and maybe the others too?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. In our deck, we have that waterfall slide where we actually take our adjusted numbers and we back
out three things. Our non-qualified numbers, we back that out. We back out insurance acquisitions and run rate to
try and compare back to what we looked like in 2019. And then with the huge growth that we've seen in our CIG
area and our wealth area and our insurance area, just organic growth, that's great to have those revenues, but
those revenues do have expenses, but those are good expenses. We're adjusting for those as well. So, that's
what we're adjusting to, to try to get back to what we looked like when we put the merger together in 2019.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. That slide 21 or page 21 was very helpful. But when we see the 4Q 2021 adjusted expenses, will it be the
$2.94 billion or we have to add that $20 million for insurance plus one that you just did?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's going to be the number â€“ the $2.94 billion will be the number on the right at the end of the waterfall.
That's a core expense. It's not a run rate number. The run rate number is the adjusted number which basically
backs out your merger and restructuring charges and your incremental MOE. That will tend to basically come
down dramatically after the first quarter of next year when we finish our core bank conversions and go away
totally by the end of 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Sorry. So, just to clarify, when we see the 4Q cost base, we'll take out the merger charges, we'll take out
the incremental cost, and should we still focus â€“ will we see the core number or the adjusted number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
The adjusted number is the run rate number on a go-forward basis. All core does is basically try to back out â€“
because we're a dynamic company that's constantly changing and growing and doing things, we have to back out
our expense bases that basically have benefited over the last two years of coming together. So, we're trying to
show you that we're getting the $1.6 billion off of that original expense base, but not penalizing us for the
additional fee revenue growth that we received over the last couple years and acquisitions that we've done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. All right. That makes sense. Sorry to make you go through all that. And then as we kind of think through
next year, do we take that â€“ the 4Q level, annualize it and obviously you got some more cost saves coming,
maybe a little seasonality in 1Q. But can you run rate that 4Q level and then be lower than that for next year full
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:56:34) $1.6 billion cost saves, so we'll get that by the end of 2022. We have a lot of things
going on in the company right now besides those five bucket of savings, which we're making tremendous

progress in. Kelly talked about the voluntary separation and retirement program that we announced. That
basically â€“ we have some teammates that volunteered to go away. Basically the first wave of that will happen on
9/30. So, you'll see the impact of that in the fourth quarter. That will continue to come down over the next couple
quarters. The waves probably are three or four waves overall to get everybody that volunteered to go â€“ to exit the
company.
And then Kelly and Bill talked about basically going through all of our processes and adjustments that we're
making to come together and get more efficiencies and scale. When we came together in 2019, we knew what we
knew then. We know a lot more now. And we're continuing to make our company much more efficient and
improved. And we'll have savings from that all through 2022. But to be honest with you, we're creating fuel that
basically would not only fall to the bottom line, but we're also continuing to make a lot more investments in our
businesses in wealth, insurance, CIG and other areas. And we're also investing in technology and digital with
these savings that we're getting.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Hi. I wanted to follow up the new capital target, Daryl said, creates $4 billion, $5 billion of incremental
excess capital. I just was wondering, Bill or Kelly, how you're thinking about that between M&A opportunities and
share repurchases. Any thoughts you could share on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, John, our waterfall of priorities has not changed in all these years. And that's what we would think that stable
long-term investors would appreciate. The number one is always organic growth that's highest payback for you
shareholders. The second is our good stable long-term increasing dividend payout. Third is M&A and we have
good opportunities there. And that's been very, very encouraging. And fourth is buyback and we're willing to do
that aggressively when it's appropriate.

Okay.

William Henry Rogers, Jr. A

And, hey, John, just to emphasize that and Kelly said it, I mean, and you see in our results, I mean, our organic
opportunities are significant. So, what we see with our markets where we see our ability to invest, so that's going
to be priority one and it continues to enhance.

Okay. And then just to follow up on that. Is it a target we should think about kind of for the next year or so? Is that
how you're thinking about like kind of maybe moving down over the next year to that 9.75%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think, John, what we've said consistently is, as the risk of the merger comes down and our confidence in
the economy goes up, we'll evaluate that target. So, I think we're going to be on that trajectory. And I mean, it
would be logical that our confidence is going to improve on the merger and improves every day. Daryl outlined a
pretty good chart of the things that we've been doing. And then we'll all look and see how the economy is doing.
So, we don't want to ever time bound that decision. It's really time bound by what's happening in our company
and what's happening in the general economy.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just on the M&A front, I know you just indicated that you see some good opportunities there.
Could you just give us your updated thoughts on that front? What type of M&A are you most interested in? And
then, separately, curious to get your thoughts on President Biden's Executive Order, which seems to be implying
greater scrutiny around larger bank deals. I want to see if that makes you think any differently about future deals.
Thanks.

Yeah. John, on the M&A side, I think we'll be consistent with the things that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the
insurance side, we've had really good experience there and I would expect that to continue. We talked in Betsy's
question about some of the enterprise payments, some of the opportunities we have there, some of the point-of-

sale. I mean, things that have been important to us strategically, digital perhaps, but things that have been
important to us strategically will be consistent. I mean, we won't go sort of off-track from our core consistency.
And as it relates to President Biden's thing, as it relates our business, I mean, let's take â€“ maybe take a large
bank M&A off the table. We've already done one of those. So, we feel really good about that. But as it relates to
our business, I mean, this really plays well to our sort of core middle market business. I mean, if you think about
the place where we offer advice and where we see activity in the future, we think we're actually really, really well-
positioned.

Great. That's helpful, Bill. And then, separately, just on your systems conversion, can you just give us a status
update on where you stand on your core deposit conversion system? Just I want to confirm, are you definitely
moving to a new system and not a legacy system when it comes to the core deposit banking system? And then,
where are you on that progress, in that actual â€“ that part of the tech migration? Thanks.

William Henry Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Daryl outlined in that one chart sort of all the different components that we're doing as it relates to the core
conversion. We outlined in there, in the fall, we'll convert the heritage BB&T clients in the first quarter we'll convert
the core FCI clients. And that's on a much more agile platform than exist today. So, we're going to have a lot more
flexibility in the things that we can do and the movements we can make and the assimilation of acquisitions, the
ability to leverage APIs and do more things with that platform. And we are absolutely on track. I mean, as you can
imagine, we are monitoring this on a daily, hourly-type basis. We're in just about in the dress rehearsal part for the
fall. We're well into the UAT and SIT testing and feel good about where we are.
