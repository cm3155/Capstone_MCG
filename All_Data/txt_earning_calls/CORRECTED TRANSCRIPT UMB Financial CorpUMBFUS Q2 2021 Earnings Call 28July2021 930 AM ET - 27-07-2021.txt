Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our strong second quarter results, again,
demonstrates the benefits of our diverse business model and our investment thesis, which includes above-peer
loan growth and solid net interest income and fee income growth in all environments, something that we've been
able to do for many years.
Second quarter highlights include 19% average loan growth on a linked-quarter annualized basis, excluding PPP
balances, and a 21% increase in fee income. Additionally, we announced that the board approved a $0.05 or
15.6% increase in our quarterly dividend.
As you saw in our release, our provision expense was higher than previous levels due to strong loan growth and
elevated charge-offs, which were driven entirely by one commercial factoring relationship. Excluding this credit
event, we would have had net recoveries in the quarter.
The underlying quality of our loan portfolio remains strong, with nonperforming loan balances down 24.1% from
the first quarter. As we've shared in previous quarters, we have refocused our factoring efforts, targeting largely
transportation companies and small receivables. And we are comfortable with the characteristics of this portfolio.
Looking ahead with what we know today and the quality we see across our portfolio, we expect charge-offs to
come in closer to our historical level of about 25 to 30 basis points for the full year of 2021. Sentiment in our
markets continues to move towards more normalized levels and our customers remain cautiously optimistic.
While keeping a close eye on the trajectory of the pandemic, modified loan balances are down to just a handful of
loans, and those are slated to be resolved in the coming months. As with many of our peers, we've begun the
transition to return our workforce to the office. Our banking centers have reopened. We've begun to do more face-
to-face client meetings and are working towards staggered returns of our non-branch teams after Labor Day.
While we have maintained our high-level productivity and customer service in recent months, much of that was
fostered by relationships [ph] up until summertime (00:04:01). I'm excited for the energy, camaraderie and
collaboration that comes with seeing each other on a day-to-day basis and with our customers more regularly.
Turning to our second quarter results, net income was $87.4 million or $1.79 per share. And pre-tax, pre-provision
income on an FTE basis was $138 million or $2.83 a share. Slide 18 shows the primary drivers behind our results.
And I'll provide some high-level comments, then turn it over to Ram for more detail.
Net interest income increased 3.6% from the first quarter, as the positive impact and the strong balance sheet
growth was mitigated by lower PPP income and some modest margin compression. On a year-over-year basis,
net interest income increased 12.8% despite a 31-basis-point decline in earning asset yields. Our track record for
relative outperformance in asset growth and the opportunities we see for that to continue should allow us to grow
net interest income over time.
Fee income for the quarter increased 21% on a linked-quarter basis, impacted largely by a $7.2 million gain in our
position in Tattooed Chef, compared to a $16.1 million loss in the first quarter. This gain included realized gains
from the sale of 3.5 million shares of Tattooed Chef as well as a mark-to-market adjustment on the remaining 1.2
million shares.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
As I noted earlier in the year, equity investments similar to Tattooed Chef are part of our ongoing strategy to
provide capital financing to our customer base across all credit structures. And while we don't expect them all to
have similar size, we will continue to see liquidity events from time to time, including a couple smaller pre-tax
gains this quarter, which totaled $5.2 million and are included in our $15.5 million in investment security gains.
One such investment, a combination of mezzanine debt and equity, yielded an internal rate of return of 41%. This
included 114% return on the equity portion of our investment upon the sale to another entity.
Our focus on expanding our fee income businesses continued, and we saw success across the company.
Institutional banking provided more than half that fee income in 2021. Both of our traditional corporate trust and
specialty trust teams have experienced phenomenal growth year-to-date, with new business dollar volumes
increasing 68% and 109%, respectively, over the 2020 levels. We've seen a resurgence in aviation financing
activity, and our location in Dublin provides additional opportunities to capitalize on these trends internationally.
Fund services, assets under administration now stand at $379 billion compared to $286 billion a year ago, and
fund services' contribution to fee income has increased 30% over that time. In Investor Solutions, we continue to
add fintech partnerships, which we've highlighted on slide 39, and this has been the best six months on record for
public finance, with 52 deals closed year-to-date, an increase of 79% compared to 2020.
Turning to Private Wealth, we now have $16 billion in customer assets, and we're on track to exceed sales
volumes from 2020. We're beginning to see activity in our new family office offering, and we have a solid pipeline
there.
Moving to the balance sheet, slide 24 is a snapshot of our loan portfolio, showing strong 19% annualized growth I
mentioned earlier. Growth in C&I came from a variety of industries across our book this quarter. Importantly,
approximately two-thirds of that growth was from new borrowers. Commercial line utilization ticked up slightly to
32% following a couple of quarters in the high 20s.
In CRE, multifamily and industrial projects led the growth during the quarter and we continue to make headway in
our expansion markets with Utah among the top three. Average residential mortgage balances increased 6.2%
from the first quarter to $1.7 billion. Funded mortgage loans for the quarter increased 33% to $276 million,
including $39 million in the secondary market. Total top line loan production for the quarter was $1.3 billion
outside of PPP balance changes, with payoffs and paydowns of 4.7% of loans.
Looking to the third quarter, we see a robust pipeline in both C&I and CRE as we see opportunities to continue to
gain market share in many of our underpenetrated markets and verticals.
On slide 26, we've updated our exposure to sensitive industries. As we moved further through the pandemic,
we've adjusted this list to reflect both the characteristics of our portfolio and the evolving outlook for various
categories. Changes this quarter include the removal of Retail CRE based on our borrower performance and the
composition of our book, which is almost 50% [ph] anchored (00:09:18) by grocery stores.
Loans in the remaining two categories, hotel and senior living, totaled $928 million or 5.7% of total loans,
excluding PPP. After our typical analysis of mitigating factors, including strong sponsors and guarantors, we feel
that approximately $472 million or just under 3% of our loans warrant a closer monitoring. As always, we are in
constant communication with these borrowers.
Our average loan-to-deposit ratio remains 61% for the quarter and was 64%, including our held to maturity
portfolio, which tends to perform similarly to loans. Our differentiated customer base, which drives diverse sources

of funding and revenue, comes with larger deposit balances. And deposit growth this quarter was driven by
Commercial Banking and Investor Solutions, along with the continued impact of recent stimulus payments.
Finally, as I mentioned, the board approved a 15.6% increase in our quarterly dividend. This will increase our
dividend payout ratio while still maintaining our priorities for use of capital. Our number one focus is to grow
shareholder value through investing in growth, both organically and opportunistically through acquisitions.
To wrap it up, we continue to see positive momentum across the company, and I'm pleased with our second
quarter performance. And I'm excited by the opportunities that we see in the second half of the year.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram for a few additional comments. Ram?

Ram Shankar
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Mariner. Net interest income of $201.1 million represented an increase of 3.6% from the first quarter.
We realized $9.2 million of PPP fees. And the PPP contribution to the second quarter net interest income was
$12.4 million compared to $13.4 million last quarter. At quarter end, our PPP balances stood at $766 million,
down from $1.4 billion at March 31. Approximately $18 million in [ph] unamortized (00:11:25) fees remain at the
end of the second quarter.
Average earning asset yields decreased 4 basis points to 2.70% due to 6-basis-point declines in both loan and
security yields and asset mix changes, including the $137 million decline in average PPP balances.
Our levels of liquidity remain elevated with our Fed account, reverse repo and cash balances comprising 14% of
average earning assets with a yield of 30 basis points, down slightly from 32 basis points in the first quarter. The
3-basis-point decline in net interest margin on a linked-quarter basis was driven by repricing pressure and mix
changes in both the loan and securities portfolio as well as the lower PPP income I noted.
We continue to deploy a portion of excess liquidity, as well as cash flows from our securities book into our AFS
portfolio, as evidenced by the $2 billion increase in average balances from last year. Portfolio composition and
activity trends are shown on slide 29. And during the quarter, we had cash flows of $437 million at a yield of
1.77%. And we purchased $1.1 billion of securities that yielded 1.4%.
So far in 2021, we've executed just over $900 million of fair value hedges with varying delayed starts and seven-
year terms on average. These are designed to mitigate earnings and capital impact in a rising rate environment.
These hedges are matched to long-dated municipal bonds and fixed a portion of index funding cost and involve
making fixed rate payments in exchange for receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements.
Looking ahead, the margin trajectory will largely depend on levels of liquidity, pace and timing of PPP forgiveness,
and reinvestment rates on cash flows in the securities portfolio. Overall, we would expect some additional modest
margin pressure in the second half of this year.
Noninterest income for the second quarter was $131.6 million and contained a $7.2 million pre-tax gain on the
valuation of our TTCF investment, compared to a $16.1 million pre-tax loss in the first quarter. Mark-to-market
adjustments on the remaining 1.2 million shares will continue to flow through the securities gain and losses line
item within fee income.

Other drivers to fee income for the quarter were the additional gains from our capital corporate initiatives that
Mariner mentioned along with an increase of $1.4 million in bankcard fees, offset by lower trading and investment
banking income and $1 million reduction in trust and securities processing income.
As you'll see on slide 22, fund services income increased during the quarter, offset by the impact of the sale of
Prairie Capital Management announced last quarter. The full details of our various fee income line items are
shown on that slide and Mariner commented on some of the growth opportunities we have in several of those
businesses.
Noninterest expense trends are shown on slide 23. Expenses were essentially flat from the first quarter at $201.3
million as the increases outlined there were largely offset by seasonal decreases in payroll taxes, insurance and
401(k) expense, as well as lower bonus and commissions. Our effective tax rate for the first six months of the
year was 17%. For the full year 2021, we anticipate it'll be approximately between 16% to 18%.
We continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total risk-based capital at 13.84%, CET1 ratio at 11.91%
and leverage ratio at 8%. Our tangible book value per share increased 11.9% during the last 12 months to $59.96
at June 30.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of
the call.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just to start, can we start with the factoring loss? Can you give us any details around that? That seems like
a larger loss. I'm guessing it's probably not tied to the targeted transportation and smaller receivables if it's not
large. And then after that, could you also let us know what portion of the book is still maybe a part from
transportation and smaller receivables after this charge?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jared. I guess to sort of level set the whole deal, I take you to page 28, and just for all those on the call.
It's a really great page to sort of summarize what credit really looks like at UMB. And you'll notice on that slide that
the past four quarters, there were no losses, especially [ph] when they were factoring loss (00:17:04). And in this
recent quarter, without that loss, we would have 9 basis points of recovery for the quarter.
And as in previous comments we've made about factoring, dating back to the first original loss we had, this was
an acquired business. We changed out the management. We've refocused the business, as you said, on
transportation and smaller receivables. And so that – I guess I'd say that's all still true, still the case. We've
refocused the business, this particular credit, as was identified back then.
And I guess I'd just [ph] repoint (00:17:52) you to – everything has been changed, altered and we feel good about
the business that's left. It's a very small business. And it is, as you said, we focus on smaller and transportation
credits. And really, overall, the reality is significant reductions in our nonperforming on the company, an excellent
quarter inclusive of this loss. And we expect to get back to our historic charge-off rate by the end of the year, for
the full year of 30 basis points or less in charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Was that loan included in nonperforming or classified loans before the charge-offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
It was not. It was not. And – yeah. So, that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
...echoes the performance of our nonperforming loans. So it is that much – even that much better, sort of
describing the whole portfolio. I think 2018 does really a nice job of just talking about our long-term trends and our
track record. On the call with me are the two guys that do that with me. One has been with us 34 years [ph] on 25
and Jim here's (00:19:05) 27 years. So, it's the same team doing the same thing, managing at the same way for a
very long time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just to finish this component up. Are there any other components of factoring that were identified
in 2018 that are more along the lines of this loss or the loss back in 2018?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No everything that's left in the portfolio are conforming factoring loans and are all performing.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe shifting a little bit to expenses, it's good to see expenses came in on target from commentary
before. Going back to fourth quarter, you had expressed some potential optimism for positive operating leverage
this year. Do you think we're on track to potentially see that on a full-year basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, if you back out PPP in future periods, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Back out the revenue or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, next year – you don't want to compare next year to this year with the PPP gains, right? So if you
back that out, I would say yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess [indiscernible] (00:20:27) just looking at – can you give any update on expectations or
drivers for AUA growth as we go forward through the rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, that's, at some level, hard to predict. A lot of that has to do with what's going on in the marketplace with
asset values. If you're talking about new business specifically, the pipelines remain very, very strong across all
those businesses. So I'd say pipeline, very strong. Asset values is another is another question, but [ph] definitely
(00:21:01)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
New business in our Private Wealth Management group is up 20%, and that's new business from new customers,
not including market action on the organic book. We've seen unexpectedly strong sales activity, and when I say
unexpectedly, just because we're still in the COVID environment, which shows our sales forces getting out there
and finding new business and being able to have face-to-face appointments, which has been part of what has
made it successful over time. So that has been nice to see.
The fund services business is – continue to be strong. There have been some delays in conversions just due to
our clients being back in the office as well. But we have signed contracts and a strong backlog there also.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Nate. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Pretty impressive loan growth in the quarter and it's encouraging to see [ph] apparently (00:22:32) C&I line
utilization increased in the quarter. I think that is ahead of kind of what we see from some other of your peers so
far in the quarter. So would just love to get some color on the drivers for the increase in line utilization this quarter
and just the overall C&I growth, that was again impressive, and just kind of the outlook for overall loan growth in
the back half of this year ex-PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks. It's interesting, the loan growth question. I've been following the comments myself. And I actually –
I'm just as interested as to why others aren't seeing loan growth as to why people are interested as why we are
seeing loan growth. And my comments around that are we've – at the backdrop you've got a huge stimulus in the
market. You've got PPP funds. At the company level, you got a monster level of liquidity. You have recovering
economy. And for me that's the backdrop for loan growth. So I've actually struggled to understand why others are
talking about not having loan growth.
So for me, it's just sort of the basic backdrop of a nice recovery as a backdrop for our loan growth coupled with
the fact that what we've said for years now is we're underpenetrated geographically and underpenetrated
vertically. And we don't budget our loan growth based on multiple GDP like a lot of banks do. We do ours based
on the ability of our loan officers to build, to execute on our pipelines and gain market share.
So with that backdrop for our pipeline and what we've seen and then able to demonstrate year in, year out, that's
what drives our loan growth. It comes across all categories and is in the prepared comments, the C&I side, three-
quarters of that was new business from new customers.
On the line utilization, I wouldn't get too excited one way or the other about that. [ph] I would – that's (00:24:24) a
point in time that thing can go bounce around a little bit. What I would say is it's stable. I wouldn't point too much

one way or the other. It's up slightly on a point in time basis, but what I'd say is it's stable. And so those would be
my big comments there about it. It's business as usual for us on loan growth. And I think that we typically give you
a quarter ahead look and Jim commented on that. It looks as strong as it has been and just not nothing new on
the loan growth front.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
And we did mention, Nate, that we anticipated more closings in first quarter that did roll to second quarter. So that
did have some impact on the outsized growth for second quarter, but third quarter remains strong. And we've also
seen a lift from our consumer mortgage business that we've placed on the balance sheet as well, roughly $100
million. So, that's been additive also.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then just maybe shifting to capital, we'd love to get some updated excess capital deployment
priorities, what you're seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities as well? And just any thoughts on the buyback
with a little bit of a retreat in sector-wide valuations recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, in our prepared comments, we talked about our priorities. The increase in the dividend was really, what I
would call, a catch-up dividend increase to get us kind of level set with the kind of experience that our
shareholders have been used to from us. So, that's what that was, sort of a catch-up, get us back to our payout
ratio that we've historically demonstrated.
As far as just the regular use for our capital, we would very much like to find a way to deploy capital to grow our
business. Obviously, with the loan growth that we have, that's the place it's going to go first. And secondly, we
love to find M&A activity, M&A opportunities. It won't come as a surprise to you that there's nothing to announce
to you, but we were asking for it. We would very much like to add value to our business through some M&A
activity.
And all I can say about that is we remain active. We remain – we're making phone calls [ph] we're pounding the
street (00:26:57) using shoe leather, building relationships and doing everything we can. But we're not going to do
something just to do something, right. So, it's got to be something that fits culturally and really adds value. We're
not going to do what I call a ticker tape acquisition, one – just to announce something. It's got to fit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Looks great color. If I could just ask one more on overall balance sheet dynamics. As the PPP forgiveness
process continues to unfold, it looks like some of your commercial clients are working through excess liquidity and
drawn online [indiscernible] (00:27:38) expectation sort of deposit flows and just the overall size of the balance
sheet over the back half of 2021 as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, that's the million-dollar question in it. We debate that ourselves internally. So it's almost hard to answer that
one when everybody on the phone on my end would probably give you a different answer. But I think we've –

there's definitely excess liquidity on our balance sheet. Whether that's $1 billion, $2 billion or $4 billion is
anybody's guess.
And so I think there's some excess liquidity on our balance sheet, but from our vantage point, we are always
focused on deposit growth and we always have the ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet that is off-
balance sheet [ph] if that were ever (00:28:35) something we needed. The other thing to think about for us, which
I think is kind of unique in the space, is our loan to deposit ratio is so low to start with. I'm not sure it really matters
how much excess liquidity we have because really if some of our order roll off, our ratios would just look better
anyway.

Hey, [indiscernible] (00:29:17). This is Andrew actually on for Chris McGratty [ph] that's asking question

Hey, Andrew. Hi, there.

Andrew Leischner Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just wondering, so I noticed your fee income came up a little higher than expected. Can you just go into, I guess,
the [ph] pieces of fees (00:29:34) this quarter and what that run rate looks like going into the back half of half
year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean high level – and I'll let my team jump in if they want to add color. But high level, I'd say, it came
really across the board. So in all of our asset-based businesses, there was great business development, new
client activity. The markets have been stronger than I think we all thought they would be. Certainly in my shop, we
have felt that way.
So really across all the asset-backed, asset-based businesses, the activities are very strong. And in our corporate
trust business, with the economy opening back up, aviation trust businesses come back on, yeah, I mean, just –
really, really saw it across the board in all of our businesses. Jim mentioned strong asset growth, client growth in
our Private Wealth business. You want to add anything else, Jim?

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we had additional swap income this quarter. Commercially, we saw additional growth with the [ph] KCA –
we announced that in our capital markets group, the KCAS (00:30:49) another win in that group where we saw –
you saw that fee income on what page would that be in the deck, 22?

Mariner Kemper A

In the equity return on another investment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
In another private investment, obviously, not as large as Tattooed Chef, but obviously outsized return for our
investments. And really – and [ph] manifests (00:31:20) really across the board. Those would be a couple of the
key highlights and then off the fee income on account fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would like to come back to [ph] KCA still (00:31:32) you've seen the returns from Tattooed Chef. We don't
expect to see those kind of returns in that business every time, but you should expect to see us see liquidity
events in our equity investments on an ongoing basis and [ph] as evidenced (00:31:49) by having one in this
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Leischner Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Great. Thank you. And then just one more on the tax rate. It looks like it came in a little higher than last
quarter and the previous two quarters. What do you think is a good run rate for the tax rate going forward? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. We would say 16% to 18%, Andrew, for the full year 2021. Every quarter, we adjust the tax rate based on
just expected earnings and everything else. So tends to jump around a little bit, but for the full year, I would say
16% to 18%.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Hi. Just a question going back to the discussion around fee income. The public finance and trading line
continues to perform, I think, fairly well. And in the past, you've talked about the upside of that business with

greater infrastructure spending. So I just wonder if you guys could kind of quantify it. The infrastructure bill ends
up getting done. Kind of what's the earnings power that's yet to be realized within that line going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
That's really hard to judge. They're still debating it in the first place, then you got to go through appropriation, then
it's got to get distributed to state levels and then they got [indiscernible] (00:33:15) a pretty long path. It's hard to
tell you when we might see that. So I don't know when we might see it, certainly, not in the next quarter. I mean, I
don't know when we'll see that stuff. It's still – hasn't even made out of Washington yet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
We can tell you though that we have approved and we are adding additional associates in that area, or – and we
have seen success that's been documented as far as our activities, and we do anticipate it being beneficial for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean some of what we've seen there, too, is taxable municipals have made their way into the
marketplace in a meaningful way, so that some of the business we've been underwriting is taxable municipals. So
the market is changing, and there's a lot of liquidity. I think the real key here is, regardless, there's an enormous
amount of liquidity. So institutions and banks are needing to deploy it.
The commissions are different based on the kinds of securities that are being traded and built and sold. But
there's a lot of activity still because of the liquidity, and that's what you're seeing. And I think you'll continue to see
that probably up till the time through until the time that we do benefit from what might happen from infrastructure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And just one other question around expenses. With the institutional segment still performing well, I'm
curious if there's shift in kind of the structure of incentive compensation. I believe historically that business has
had a higher variable comp component to it, historically. So I'm just curious if any of that's shifted more recently
that kind of supports kind of how expenses have been a little bit more controlled in terms of overall growth
recently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No. I would actually say the opposite. Some of the expense growth that we do have is from paying out on
commissions and sales.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.

So it's been more controlled than the other areas in the – in this -what expense increases we have had because
of sales activity. We've tried to be more balanced over time to make sure that our sales officers are bringing in the
business that we – all the different types of business that we offer. So that's where we continue to tweak our sales
incentive, is to make sure that our officers are – become more generalists and specialists when it comes to selling
all that we have to sell. And Jim...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. No. We make sure that our incentives are balanced with what is in the best interest of the bank such as
additional incentives [ph] cross (00:36:09) even though we – I don't know the industry likes this term very much
anymore as far as cross-sell activities, but we make sure we're partnering with the other lines and exposing
different lines of business to different customer bases where they can have referral activity that makes sense.
We were rewarding that activity more handsomely than in the past, which – where it benefits the bank. But just
like any organization, we constantly evaluate our programs, but they have not changed drastically or we're not
seeing pressure from the market to do that. We believe we're extremely competitive, and actually the employer of
choice for all our divisions. [ph] That's a little plug for UMB for NA (00:36:58).
