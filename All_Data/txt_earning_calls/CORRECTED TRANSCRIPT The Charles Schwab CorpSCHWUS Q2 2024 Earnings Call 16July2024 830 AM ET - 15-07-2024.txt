Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Jeff Edwards
Managing Director & Head-Investor Relations, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Schwab 2024 Summer Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards,
Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick

Walter William Bettinger
Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our July business update. Earlier this
year, we spoke about 2024 being a transition year for the firm. We define this year as transitional for a series of
reasons. We were anticipating completing the last transition groups from the Ameritrade acquisition, and we
anticipated that former Ameritrade clients would move from negative asset flows to positive levels of net new
assets. We further anticipated that former Ameritrade retail clients would begin to utilize Schwab capabilities in
the areas of investment advisory, financial planning and banking. We anticipated the investment advisors who
formerly used Ameritrade for custodial services would also begin to bring net new assets to Schwab. And their
evaluation of our service levels would improve rather dramatically. We anticipated that Schwab users of
StreetSmart would begin to take advantage of the powerful trading capabilities in the thinkorswim platforms. From
a capital standpoint, we anticipated that we would organically build capital throughout the year toward over our
long-term objectives.
From a financial standpoint, we anticipated improving, albeit somewhat uneven, earnings results during the year
with Q4 2024 delivering somewhere between $0.80 and $0.90 and then with strong growth continuing into 2025
and beyond. Halfway through the year, this definition of a transition year is being realized, again as we
anticipated. And all of these issues position us for a strong period of growth in client metrics and financial results
in the coming years. So with these critical indicators of success unfolding in such a positive manner, let's take a
quick look tactically at how the second quarter of this year looked. Inflation showed some encouraging signs of
moderating closer to the Fed target of 2%, which continued pushing a select number of primarily technology
stocks ever higher during the quarter. Investor sentiment remained solidly positive at quarter-end, with investors
purchasing stocks throughout the quarter and overall trading activity was a bit higher than in the prior year.
And as we stated earlier, as we anticipated, we completed the last client transition group during the second
quarter. That's almost $2 trillion in assets, 17 million client accounts, and over 3.5 million daily average trades all
done with attrition levels that are well below other integrations in our industry, as well as our estimates at the time

of the acquisition, which were 5% to 6% asset attrition and 4% revenue attrition. And while it's still somewhat
early, the client response to the combined platform has been even stronger than we anticipated.
Promoter scores for former Ameritrade retail clients are now increasing about 50 points, nine months post
conversion date while the promoter scores for Advisor Services including the former Ameritrade advisor clients,
have returned to pre-conversion levels. Impressively, former Ameritrade retail clients who converted in 2023 are
already bringing in assets on a net basis. However, their level of net new assets still remains below our target
range. Clearly, this illustrates that we're reaching an inflection point as attrition continues to abate and we rebuild
back to firm-wide net new asset levels in our targeted 5% to 7% range.
And lastly, former Ameritrade retail clients are already making up about one-third of our overall enrollments in
advisory solutions, an early illustration of the power of combining the two firms and their interest in Schwab's
broader offering of wealth management solutions. Our overall client engagement was solid in the second quarter,
with the equity buy/sell ratio at about 1.1, while daily average trades remained at relatively high levels for a
second quarter and above the same period from last year. Meanwhile, we've seen a large increase in interest
among our clients in our managed investing solutions.
So overall key client metrics continue to be solid. Net new assets year-to-date were over $150 billion, including
Q2 asset gathering of about $60 billion, up 17% from the same period last year. Again, still somewhat below our
long-term goal of 5% to 7% through an economic cycle. But growing closer to that figure as the impact from
former Ameritrade client attrition begins to wane. New brokerage accounts were, again, almost $1 million, I'm
sorry, 1 million accounts during the quarter.
Now looking deeper at the types of clients we're attracting, these new-to-firm households continue to set us up
well for the long term, with almost 6 out of 10 new clients under the age of 40. And investment advisor clients of
all sizes continue to entrust their client assets to our custodial services. For years, we've emphasized that Schwab
Advisor Services is the Premier offering for RIAs of all sizes, and we are equally committed to each segment of
advisors and these net new asset results are particularly encouraging as they reflect our success serving again
every size advisor.
Let me take a brief step back to take a more big picture look at Schwab and the growth trajectory we've been on
for over 50 years. From our origins as a discount broker, we have continually listened to client needs, as well as
anticipated client needs and added services and capabilities along the way. What is key is that we have always
done so in a Schwab Way, Through Clients' Eyes at a great value and without the clients having to accept trade-
offs. We call that modern wealth management and when we look to the future, we believe this formula will only
serve to build our market share larger and larger.
Of course, one of the key capabilities we've added along the way has been banking services to meet the needs of
our clients on both sides of their personal balance sheets. Now, some have asked us, after the regional banking
crisis of 2023, whether we remain committed to serving our clients' banking needs and the answer is a definite
yes. That said, we have studied our approach to offering banking services in recent quarters and wanted to share
a few additional perspectives on how we see banking unfolding in the future at Schwab.
Offering lending services to our retail clients and the clients of the investment advisors we serve is important.
Arguably, it's critical as it meets client needs and deepens relationships in a meaningful way. Most of our
significant competitors have the ability to assist clients with both their investing needs, as well as their borrowing
needs. We believe firms that do not offer lending services are at a strategic disadvantage that will show itself
more and more over time. So we are committed to offering quality lending services in a manner consistent with

how we lend today exclusively for our clients residential mortgages, HELOCs for clients who have their first
mortgage with us and pledged asset lines.
And to support lending for our clients, we continued to invest in both technology to make the application and
approval process streamlined and efficient, as well as experienced bankers who can help shepherd the more
complex loans through. From the standpoint of the investments we make at the bank for deposits in excess of
those needed for lending to our clients, over time and by that I mean years, not months or quarters, we would
envision some shortening of our overall balance sheet investment portfolio duration. That could lead to some
modestly higher earnings volatility through an interest rate cycle, but should help reduce volatility of our capital
levels and the need to access supplemental borrowing when interest rates potentially rise rapidly.
One of our objectives is to increase our emphasis on attracting transactional bank deposits, like checking
balances with our award-winning checking product. This would serve as a means of increasing liquidity and
further stabilizing our overall deposit base. And we envision the potential to increase our usage of third-party
banks like TD Bank and others to achieve the following goals; deliver extended FDIC insurance for clients; lower
our capital intensity and improve liquidity subject of course to obtaining economics from the third-party banks that
makes sense for us. Net, these various actions should lead again over time to a bank that is somewhat smaller
than our bank has been in recent years, while retaining the ability to meet our clients' banking needs, lower our
capital intensity, and importantly, protect the economics we are able to generate from owning a bank.
So while we see some modest changes in the way we manage and operate our bank, one thing you can count
on, we will continue to operate our business in the Schwab Way. Making decisions Through Clients' Eyes, offering
clients great value and delivering service and advice to our valued clients without asking for any trade-offs.
So Rick, let me turn it over to you for some more discussion on our efforts as well as results during the second
quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Wurster
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Thanks, Walt, and good morning, everyone. With the successful completion of the Ameritrade conversion behind
us, we are looking ahead to an exciting new chapter as we continue to advance our four strategic focus areas.
And we will do so from a position of strength, having fully combined the best of Schwab and Ameritrade to offer
our clients a no trade-off experience. Our ability to increase our scale while also continuously driving efficiency in
our operations remains one of our key competitive advantages. The Ameritrade integration is a clear example of
how we have vastly increased our scale while cutting costs. And by the end of this year, we'll realize the
remaining 10% of run rate expense synergies from the acquisition.
Over time, our growing client base, our cost discipline and our ongoing investments in technology will continue to
help us reduce our cost to serve our clients, in the same way it has over the past decade as we decreased our
cost per client account by 25%. Excuse me, and by around 50% when you consider inflation. We plan to build on
this competitive advantage. We will invest in technology, including artificial intelligence that will ultimately help us
lower our costs. We will implement operational enhancements and process transformation so we can serve our
clients even more efficiently than we do today.
And as we continue to increase our scale and enhance our efficiency, we'll reinvest in our clients over time and
support our growth for the long term just as we've done historically. Win-win monetization is about meeting more
of our client's total financial needs by offering the ease and convenience of having them bring more of their
financial life in one place, we're also able to bolster our revenue growth and our wealth business is growing

quickly, and this is a win for clients as client promoter scores for our advice solutions are among the highest at the
firm. So these are our happiest clients and it is a win for us. Year-to-date, we've attracted nearly $25 billion in
managed investing net flows, a 56% increase over last year. And we see strong net flows across our spectrum of
solutions. And you can see the growth on this page, 40% in Schwab Wealth Advisory, 53% in Wasmer Schroeder
and a 127% in Schwab Personalized Indexing.
By offering our clients a broad spectrum of the wealth solutions they need, we're also supporting growth in our
fee-based revenue streams as you can see with the growth in our revenue on the right hand side of this page.
Looking within our wealth solutions, I wanted to do a bit of a deeper dive into our Wasmer strategies. These fixed
income strategies provide clients with a wide range of tax exempt and taxable solutions. Clients also have access
to a dedicated team of portfolio managers and portfolio personalization capabilities, all at a lower cost than
competitive offerings. With total assets under management of $25 billion, we've seen assets in these strategies
grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23% since our acquisition in July of 2020 and have grown by nearly
80% in the last two years where we've had a higher interest rate environment.
This year-to-date alone, we've seen net flows of $4 billion demonstrating that these solutions are indeed meeting
client needs.
Turning now to client segmentation at Schwab, we will always meet the needs of a wide spectrum of investors
and RIA firms, but we also need to serve our distinct client segments. And strong relationships are the foundation
of our ability to do this. When we build relationships by meeting client needs and meeting clients where they are,
and with the service models, tailored education and the specialized capabilities they need, we will retain our
existing clients and attract new ones. RIAs, which are one of our key client segments. We strengthen our
relationships with RIAs of all sizes through an unparalleled offer that helps each of them grow, compete and
succeed. For example, we offer advisors, turnkey asset management solutions, flexible technology, and highly
specialized business consultant teams all at an incredible value with zero custody fees and no intention of
changing that.
Turning to our retail business, high net worth retail clients are another important segment where the power of
strong relationships is clear. Our high net worth retail investors who have a financial consultant bring in more than
3 times the average household net new assets, 2.8 times the managed investing net flows and have better TOA
ratios and notably higher client promoter scores compared to retail high net worth clients who do not have an FC.
Continuing to invest, so we can build and expand on these valuable client relationships will help support our
growth over the long term.
Our fourth strategic focus area is the brilliant basics. We know that if we can make it even easier for our clients to
do business with us and if we can deliver on the basics for our clients in every interaction they have at Schwab
will build loyalty and our delighted clients will grow their wealth with us and refer their friends and family members
to us. One example of how we're delivering on this for clients is the enhancements we continue to make through
the best-in-class Schwab Mobile App. We know clients and third parties like it today. Our mobile app has a 4.8
star rating on the App Store, and for the second year in a row, Corporate Insight has ranked us the Number 1
mobile app experience among brokerage firms. And we continue to invest in and enhance that experience. We're
introducing features our former Ameritrade clients love like the recently launched customizable dashboard. Other
recent and planned enhancements will simplify the client experience by reducing clicks and expanding on our
customization capabilities. that can influence asset gathering in the near term, things like the macroeconomic
environment, seasonality and some behavioral differences we see in the former Ameritrade client base, we
believe our through the cycle growth recipe remains intact. Over the longer term, we expect will continue to see

5% to 7% annualized M&A growth from existing and new clients, bolstered by delivering on our four strategic
focus areas.
As we've shared, 2024 is a transition year, with strong client engagement, a successful integration, continued
progress on our strategic focus areas and opportunities to introduce our client base to the best of Schwab and
Ameritrade, we remain well-positioned to continue serving our growing client base and delivering profitable long-
term growth to stockholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Well, thank you very much, Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about the exciting results we've already seen from the
Ameritrade integration and the opportunities that it enables. Our strong momentum in the market and the success
we've enjoyed in attracting a diverse mix of clients, the progress we've made and continuing to enhance our
leading-value proposition, at the same time that we continue to drive greater efficiency throughout our business.
And finally, our commitment to continuing that journey, combining ever greater efficiency with sustained
investments in improving the client experience.
My time today, I'll review our solid financial performance in the second quarter and over the first half of the year.
I'll provide some high-level perspective on what we're seeing with regard to our clients' transactional cash. And I'll
share an updated scenario for 2024. The important point is that we are proceeding through what we've described
previously and what Walt talked about at the outset as a transitional year, but frankly, at a slightly faster pace than
we'd anticipated just six months ago. With our organic growth rebounding towards historical levels, a continued
moderation of client cash realignment activity despite seasonal pressures and the impact of very high investor
engagement, sequential growth in our net interest margin, continued expense discipline with adjusted expenses
basically flat year-over-year, excluding some unusual items. And finally, a steady increase in our capital levels,
both our regulatory levels and those inclusive of AOCI. And all of that sets the stage for what we expect will be
more of a return to normal, the unlocking of our core earnings power, and frankly, a much simpler financial story
in the quarters and years ahead. But one featuring strong growth in revenue and earnings in the back half of 2024
and over the next several years.
As Walt mentioned the first half of the year has been characterized by strong equity markets, increased client
engagement and solid organic growth. We saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and
Nasdaq, as well as key drivers of our business performance, including margin balances up 15% from the end of
2023, trading activity up slightly from the first six months of last year and as Rick mentioned, a real surge in
interest among clients for our advisory solutions. Our clients' transactional cash balances are typically pressured
in the first half of the year by engagement in the markets in January and February and then tax season in April
and early May. And that was no different in 2024. But even so, we continued to see a moderation of the rate
driven client cash realignment activity.
Now, that backdrop helps support solid financial performance in the second quarter with revenue up 1% year-
over-year to $4.7 billion, adjusted expenses in Q2 were up just under 2% year-over-year, but that included several
onetime and/or unusual items without which our adjusted expenses would have been down more than 1%, with
an adjusted pre-tax margin of roughly 41% and adjusted EPS of $0.73.
Turning our attention to the balance sheet, total assets dropped by 4%, driven primarily by tax-related outflows
and the continuation, albeit at a much slower pace of the client cash realignment activity we have experienced for
a little over two years. And the overall level of realignment within bank sweep and Schwab One in the quarter was
down about 50% versus the same quarter in 2023. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen strong growth in
7

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
margin utilization to start the year and to support that activity, we redirected about $5 billion of client cash from the
banks to the broker dealers. That caused our level of supplemental borrowing to rise slightly in the quarter. But I
want to emphasize again that this is a good thing. We are more than happy to absorb a bit more borrowing on
which we're paying just over 5% to support margin loans on which we're earning just under 8%.
And finally, despite rates that increased slightly during the quarter, our capital position continued to get even
stronger with our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, again, reminding you that's the one that's inclusive of AOCI and
therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI – AOCI opt-out. At Schwab Bank now well
over 6% and just under 6% for the company overall. Meaning we are marching steadily towards our new
operating objective for capital.
Now, despite the influence of typical seasonal pressure to start the year, coupled with atypically bullish, very
bullish investor sentiment, client cash balances have largely trended consistent with our expectations, despite
rates remaining higher than the Fed and the market predicted earlier in the year. And all indications support that
we are in the very late innings of client cash realignment activity. In fact, over the course of Q2, client-driven
outflows from bank sweep, despite the seasonal tax payments have been less than the cash flow generated from
our investment portfolio, which in the absence of any or other actions on our part, would have led to continued
declines in supplemental borrowing.
Now, with new client acquisition and organic growth returning to our historical norms and all signs suggesting that
the Fed funds rate is likely peaked, meaning in the absence of this catalyst, we expect the utilization of investment
cash alternatives such as purchase money funds and CDs to stabilize and then eventually decrease over time.
We believe we're nearing the point where aggregate transactional cash balances should flatten and then
ultimately resume growing again.
Now that solid start to the year lays the foundation for what we expect will be an even stronger end of the year,
propelling us into growth through 2025 and beyond. We now expect our full year revenue to range between flat to
up 2% versus 2023 or roughly in the middle of the mathematical illustrations you may recall we shared back in
January. And as I shared back in May at our Investor Day, we now expect our adjusted expenses to be
approximately 2% higher than 2023. And as a reminder, about half that change from the previous guidance is due
to unanticipated one-time items such as the FDIC surcharge and the regulatory accrual. With the remainder
coming from the increase in the SEC 31B, which is again as a pass through expense and therefore P&L neutral.
But to use the transitional wording again, that analyzed view masks the progression in earnings power by the end
of the year. We're expecting flattish earnings from Q2 to Q3. But assuming the Fed cuts rates in September, as is
widely expected, we could see our NIM reach the mid-2.20s in Q4 on its way to approaching 3% by the end of
2025, which we believe will support adjusted earnings per share in the middle of the $0.80 to $0.90 range we
outlined at the beginning of the year, with our earnings power building in 2025 and beyond.
And despite long-term rates moving a little bit higher during the quarter, our capital levels are climbing steadily
and we continue to expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to approach our slightly updated
operating objective of 6.75% to 7% on a consolidated basis by the end of 2024, at which point it becomes more of
a live conversation regarding whether and how we want to do further capital return. Our number 1 priority for
capital is always to support business growth. Now to the extent that we have capital in excess of what is needed
to do that, we have throughout our history taken steps to return that to stockholders. That can be through
increasing our dividend, which generally rises alongside earnings, that can be by redeeming outstanding
preferred to create additional dry powder for the future, especially preferreds that might be or might become
relatively expensive, and that can also be, of course, through stock buybacks, which we do opportunistically.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2024
There is one additional consideration right now, which is to the extent that we have outstanding supplemental
borrowing, we may choose to utilize some of the liquidity we'd otherwise use for buybacks to reduce some of that
bank level debt. And doing that reduces our reliance on non-business as usual funding sources and given the
relatively higher cost of the supplemental borrowings, it's likely more accretive to earnings in the near term, while
preserving the capacity, the ability to implement stock repurchases at a later date. So by doing that, we can kind
of have our cake and eat it too. Now those of you who've followed the company for a while know that we don't
tend to communicate bold, long-term financial targets. Rather, we continue to talk about our long-term financial
formula, a relatively simple and straightforward formula that is based on our clear and straightforward business
strategy, which we articulated, as you know, as Through Clients' Eyes.
And what makes that financial formula simple and straightforward is it's based on a set of pretty reasonable
assumptions for Schwab at least, around organic growth, revenue growth, expense containment and capital
return, assumptions that we have delivered through the cycle over multiple decades. Our last two-plus years that
formula has admittedly been obscured to an extent by the impact of rising rates and what that has done to client
transactional cash balances. But with rates seeming to plateau and client cash realignment moderating, while
organic growth returns to that historical level, we're nearing the point where that simple and straightforward
formula, that simple and straightforward financial story should become more clear. One that, without making some
big leap of faith, combines strong organic growth, strong profitability, and substantial capital return.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Would you like me to go to the first question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeff Edwards A
Managing Director & Head-Investor Relations, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yes, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Well, great. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks very much for the presentation. Maybe just Peter, can you talk about your
view on how you may cut deposit rates as the Fed cuts? And I guess first, first and foremost is your assumption in
your targets based on, I guess, how many Fed cuts are based on that? And then can just maybe just talk about
how you might reduce deposit – your direct deposit rates and sweep and the banking deposits as the Fed cuts,
essentially the deposit beta to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Sure. So thanks, Brian. So the scenario that we – that I outlined is based off the Fed cutting rates a single time in
the rest of this year in September. In terms of deposit betas, I wouldn't necessarily assume that deposit betas are
symmetrical. If you look historically, deposit betas tend to be a bit higher on the – in the easing cycle than they are
in a tightening cycle. And so, while we certainly haven't made any decisions exactly about what we'll do with
deposit rates, I think that's a reasonable expectation.
And we also, would expect that as rates come down, the cost of any replacements of supplemental funding that
we have to access comes down as well. And we'd also expect that, on the margin that rate cuts would over time
bring about higher levels of clients transactional cash as the incentive for them to utilize alternative solutions like
purchase money funds and CDs become somewhat less.

Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Kenneth B. Worthington Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. In terms of the use of third-party banks like TD, how much
of your bank assets might migrate to third-party banks over time at sort of steady state? And how would you
expect the economics to compare to the fees that you currently earn on a money market fund or in the Schwab
Bank spread over rate cycle? And I guess lastly, given the Wells' comments on Friday, is there risk that using
third-party banks might risk regulators having an opinion on the yields passed on to certain end customers in the
advisory or other segments of your business?

Yeah. So I think it's early to have definitive answers on the first set of questions that you asked. Although if you
research our IDA agreement with TD Bank, it probably gives you a good direction with respect to the economics.
The economics can be very attractive for us in terms of not needing to have capital relative to those deposits. And
that's where I would probably direct you to, to look in terms of the economics of that. In terms of the level, we want
to make sure that we maintain sufficient deposits at our bank to again fund the loans that our clients want and
then have appropriate levels of liquidity over and above that.
With respect to the Wells Fargo issue, we have provided money market fund, sweep cash and – or money market
yields on bank cash for all of our fiduciary-driven investment advisory solutions already. So I don't really see the
Wells Fargo report having any kind of meaningful implications for us. We've been doing this for an extended
period of time already.

Kyle Voigt Q

Hi. Good morning. Just maybe on the Ameritrade attrition abating and net new assets getting back to that 5% to
7% level as they have grown historically. I guess with the knowledge of doing prior brokerage integrations, albeit
on a smaller scale than the Ameritrade integration, do you have any expectation of when you could get back into
that range? And typically, when do you see attrition effectively fully abate after the last migration, which we've
obviously just went through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Wurster A
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Well, let me start by saying, first thanks for the question, Kyle. Let me start by saying when we look at our Schwab
client base, we continue to grow within that 5% to 7% organic growth rate that we target over the long term. So
what – when you look at the company level metrics, what's keeping us from the 5% to 7% overall is, in fact,
behavior of the Ameritrade clients. And the great thing that we're seeing is we are seeing a change in their
behavior and it's in line with what we would expect, which is first we need to stop clients from leaving the firm and
from Ameritrade flows being negative. And I think we're in the process of that happening. Walt referenced the
significant improvement in client promoter scores. That's true both on the retail side and the advisor side. So client
promoter scores are getting higher. As those client promoter scores are getting higher, we're moving from
outflows from our Ameritrade clients to inflows.
What we then need to do is to move a client base that hasn't had client flows quite in line with where Schwab
organic growth rate has been historically. We need to move them from being positive contributors to net new
assets to contributing at the same level as Schwab, as our Schwab organic growth rate. And the way we'll do that
is by introducing our Schwab model to Ameritrade clients, the financial consultant, the relationship model, the
service, the advice, the consultants that we bring on the advisor side, all of that we believe will help accelerate the
Ameritrade net new asset formation.
So we're confident we can grow in the 5% to 7% range. We continue to do so on the Schwab side today, and
we're right where we'd expect to be in terms of the process of moving Ameritrade clients from being net detractors
and net new assets to now being slightly positive. And then we anticipate by introducing our model to them, to
build and to grow them to the same level as Schwab clients over time.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Peter, I was hoping you could elaborate on your assumptions of what's going to drive the
sequential growth really after being flat in Q3 to Q4. And, specifically things like margin balances, which are
growing, but as you said, are drawing more short-term funding. So curious about short-term funding levels plus
some of the other assumptions in that Q3 to Q4 ramp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So we can – certainly, we can follow up with – we have a number of assumptions on the page there and
you're welcome to follow up with the IR team in terms of some of the details. But broadly speaking, as I mentioned
previously, the assumptions are as a single Fed cut in in September, client cash realignment activity that
continues to moderate. We'd expect it will flatten and then again, ultimately resume growth and then more of a
continuation of the general, relatively conventional assumptions around equity, market appreciation, margin
balance growth that goes along with that and so forth.
In terms of [indiscernible] (00:39:51) borrowing our carry, of course, is to pay that down as quickly as we can. But,
the pace at which we pay that down is dependent on the level of margin balance growth. And if we see – continue
to see more margin balance growth, we will, as we always do, want to make sure we support that growth and at
times that means moving some cash out of the bank – some client cash out of the bank over to the broker dealer.
But again, that is – we welcome the margin balance growth. It's good for clients. It means where our clients are
engaged that we are supporting our active trader community which is a very important segment for us.
It's a very profitable interest-earning assets. So we're more than happy to support that, even if it means that it
delays to a certain extent the pay down of supplemental borrowing, it's accretive from a NIM standpoint, accretive
from a net interest revenue standpoint and so forth. So that's why – it's why it's really I think I'd caution everyone
not to focus on supplemental borrowing, just, in isolation in a vacuum because it's influenced by other factors as
well.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, Peter, you had outlined a couple of different self-help levers. I mean, the first is the
potential to migrate additional cash off balance sheet in the future. I actually wanted to focus on the potential
opportunity to accelerate pay downs of the high-cost liabilities by repositioning the securities portfolio. And was
hoping you could just unpack what are some of the constraints that we should be mindful of when thinking
through the potential opportunity? And is it fair to assume that you would likely wait until you're at your capital
target, at which point you would maybe consider pursuing that path?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So thanks. Thanks for the question, Steven. So, I would say I know we've gotten this question, we've got
this question a fair amount and our thinking on repositioning it hasn't really changed. We certainly understand the
benefit of that on accelerating the pay down of supplemental borrowing, accelerating the net interest margin
accretion, earnings accretion that we expect to happen over time.

At the same time, we're very cognizant of and very mindful of doing anything that would jeopardize the trust our
clients place in us, especially for the sake of bringing forward something that we expect will happen on its own.
And so that's why we haven't done that. So I would say it's not something we by any means rule out altogether.
But it's also not something where we're looking to do in the near term.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to follow up on the question around the shift to third-
party banks for as a place for deposits. So just at a high level, I'm curious if you could explain to us the strategic
shift here, because, we spoke about it a year ago at the last what used to be the winter business update, now is
the Investor Day, although I guess in 2023, it was at a different timing and there was a defense of using the bank
subsidiary. So what led you to shift there? And then maybe just like timing wise, when should we expect this to
happen? And how do you strike the – you referenced, that you want liquidity above the need to fund the loans.
You know how should be thinking about what the bank will actually look like once things settle out and you take
this journey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter William Bettinger A
Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Brennan. So, as I indicated, we're talking about years, not months and quarters. And we just want
to foreshadow that over those period of years, we think that there may be approaches that are more efficient in
terms of rewarding our clients, as well as rewarding our stockholders than maintaining 100% of the deposits at
our bank. We want deposits, as I indicated, to be sufficient to cover the loans that we intend to do for our clients
that provide quality yields, deepen relationships, and we're able to do at exceptionally low-credit risk, as well as
having liquidity beyond that.
But we all recognize that deposit flows can be very volatile depending on rate environments and we have in place
one agreement already today that provides us substantial flexibility for our client deposits with exceptional
economics for us without the need for capital. And we think that there are other opportunities to consider
expanding that. Again, I want to emphasize through the prepared remarks I made that this is all subject to the
economics of doing so. But we do think there are meaningful opportunities to lighten some of the capital load over
time, again, measured in years, not months and quarters, that will provide us additional flexibility and also let us
extend FDIC insurance to higher levels for our clients.

Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. So I mean, I think I would think about that in terms of the pace of cash flows off the investment portfolio as
sort of in the $10 billion to $11 billion a quarter somewhere in that range of as the portfolio, the size of portfolio
goes down that it's reasonable expect that that level of cash flow goes down as well, sort of commensurate with
that. But sort of as a general rule of thumb over the next several quarters I think is a reasonable expectation.

Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. Well, so a lot of the things we're talking about for the
last several quarters are related to kind of self-help levers and improvement in the company's earnings power. I'll
ultimately start with improvement in the deposit trajectory of the business that'll help supplemental borrowings,
capital returns, et cetera. So maybe help us sort of refresh now that you've had the business with Ameritrade for
some time, how are you thinking about the normalized framework for growth in Schwab's deposits, sweep
deposits, whether it's a percentage of net new assets or some other metric. But I guess also considering that even
if we do get rate cuts, the Fed funds rate in the market rate is still going to be probably meaningfully higher versus
kind of the available capacity of yield that you and the industry offering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah, thanks, Alex, for the question. So, I know there's a lot of focus on kind of month-to-month, even at times,
week-to-week changes in deposit flows. I think it's important to maybe shed a little bit of context. You know, so
first is, deposit flows over a short period of time are influenced by net new assets, of course, and the cash is
brought in from new accounts. And then what clients do with that cash and that can be rate-driven allocations that
they make to purchase money funds, CDs and so forth. They can also be into engagement in the market equities,
mutual funds and so forth. And so that can create some variability. We have seen a strong engagement in the
markets. And when we look at the rate-driven activity among our clients that continues to go down.
The second point of context I would make, which is that, you do see variability in those flows from, frankly, from
day-to-day or month-to-month, and we can see $2 billion or $3 billion of net inflows or outflows on a particular
day. And so when you just look at a month's numbers, depending on what day of the week the month ends on, it
can influence the level of transactional cash that we report on, on a monthly basis. And I'd say, June was, sort of it
was comparable to May. July, as you know, has started off stronger. It's still early. It's about halfway through the
month so, we'll see how the month ends. But it is started off definitely stronger than in terms of deposit flows than
May.
In terms of the long term, to get into your question of the long term, we would expect in a stable environment that
client and transactional cash grows with the growth in accounts and the growth in total assets. We actually
recently did a study to look at clients who opened their accounts roughly 20 years ago. And what we see over
time is as those clients increase the net worth in their accounts, increase assets in their accounts, their cash
balances go up, and they actually stay at a relatively constant percent of the assets in the account.
And so I think, as you are modeling our transactional cash over a long period of time, over years, I think it's
reasonable to expect that that transactional cash grows with the growth in assets and the growth in accounts.
When rates are rising, that growth will be a little bit slower. When rates are falling, that growth will be a little bit

faster. But I think over time in a stable environment, that's a reasonable expectation over, again, over multiple
years.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter. The first one is just in terms of the
Ameritrade metrics you mentioned in terms of [ph] not (00:50:35) up to the 5% to 7% growth rate that you're
experiencing on the legacy platform. Can you scale and size the two relative asset pools that we're speaking to.
And then the broader question I have is, just as you're thinking now about migrating the growth of the bank, how
should we be thinking about the end state of the size of the bank? And does this change your capital return
methodology?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Wurster A
President, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Let me start with the Ameritrade part of the question. We brought over about $2 trillion of Ameritrade client assets.
We're at $9.4 trillion overall. So Ameritrade is clearly an important part of our business. Looking at the longer
term, it's important to remember the enthusiasm we have for the combination of the strength of Ameritrade and
Schwab. We're talking a lot about short-term dynamics around cash and net interest margin and things like that.
We have an incredible franchise that we've just spent four years putting together the best of everything
Ameritrade had to offer with the best of everything Schwab has to offer. And the behavior we're seeing from our
clients is exactly what we would expect.
We went from clients who experienced a lot of change and might have had dual relationships at Ameritrade and
somewhere else, making the decision that this wasn't where they wanted to be. And so we did see some attrition.
That attrition was well below what our expectations were. And now we're seeing what we'd expect to see in the
next phase, which is client satisfaction from those clients that were moved, who had their experience changed,
improving dramatically. We're up 35 points in our advisor services business in terms of our overall client promoter
scores following the conversion.
And on the retail side, nine months after a client moves, their satisfaction is up 50 points. So we have built a
platform that both sets of clients love. And now what we get to do for the long term and for the foreseeable future
is deliver our mission of making a difference in our clients' lives through a platform that's never been stronger on
the retail side and the advisor side than it had been – than it is right now today.
And so we're confident in our long-term organic growth rate. We think the behavior we're seeing is exactly in line
with what we would have expected and are very optimistic for our future growth.

practices evolve with more account types over time that capture these money fund equivalent yields?

Chris Allen Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the 3% NIM outlook for 2025. Just wondering, what are the
parameters that you're baking in to get there, did this entail any of the changes that you talked about around the
balance sheet strategy in terms of shortening duration as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford A
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Chris. So the 3% approaching 3 – NIM approaching 3% by the end of 2025, the primary driver of
that is again, a moderation of the client transactional cash realignment activity and the pay-down of the
supplemental borrowing that is very, very accretive to our net interest margin. In terms of, whether the comments
that Walt provided have any influence over that, I just reiterate what he said, which is that is something that's
evolutionary, not revolutionary. It's going to play out over multiple years. And so it doesn't influence at all really the
– that more near-term outlook that we have for the end of – towards the end of 2025. Thanks for the question.

Oh, great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just got a question about lending and obviously it's been an area
you guys have been talking about both on the Investor Day and then today as well. Just thinking about kind of
where Schwab is, your 40 basis points of client assets, I think you highlighted that the industry [indiscernible]
(00:55:48). So just would love to get some color around where you – how much of that gap you think you could
actually close just with your, I guess, suite of products? Number 1. And number 2, what you're comfortable going
through in terms of the mix of the balance sheet, especially just given some of the evolution of the balance sheet
we're talking about today as well? Thank you.

Walter William Bettinger A
Co-Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
Well, thanks for the question, Devin. We certainly think we can expand our lending capabilities and the way we're
focused on doing that is by creating the easiest, most straightforward, client-friendly process in the industry. And
we've seen that on within our Pledged Asset Line program, where it's now 1.7 days average cycle time to get our
Pledged Asset Line. It's actually less than a day for individual and joint accounts, but our more complex ones
drive up the average time.
85% of those originations are now done digitally. These are major enhancements. And we're making other
enhancements to our mortgage process, to the way we lend to our higher net worth clients and the experience
they have. So we're trying to build an experience that makes it such that our Schwab clients never want to borrow
somewhere else. They want to borrow from us. So we do think there is lots of runway to close that gap. And we're
quite bullish on our – on the opportunity here. And we are in a – in an interest rate environment where there's not
as much borrowing as we've seen historically, not as much rolling over of loans and things. But we are confident
that we've built the process, the experience and the offer that we should be for our clients an exceptional place to
borrow. And that includes our industry leading rates for clients that have assets with us.
Final comment I'd make is it's also a terrific way to add to the service that we provide to our advisor clients. Our
advisors for years have been asking us to do more lending because they don't want to have to introduce another
into the relationship. And increasingly, we're able to meet their needs, which delights them. And we think we'll be
able to do more of that over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter B. Crawford
Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Charles Schwab Corp.
All right. Well, I think it's my opportunity or my time to close. You know, I want to thank all of you for joining us this
morning and hearing our thoughts on the business and the opportunity in front of us. You know, I think it's very
easy to focus on very near-term tactical measures and, is, client cash realignment activity, plus or minus $1
billion, our supplemental borrowing, our net interest margin in terms of – which we measure in terms of basis
points and those of you who follow the company for a long time know that we manage for the long term and we
have a very long-term orientation. We – our faith in our clients, our faith in our strategy, our confidence in that
strategy really helps us remain focused on the long term.
And Walt described this year at the outset as a transitional year. And I think as we sit here halfway through the
year, we feel really good about how that transition is going in terms of our strategic positioning, in terms of the
completion of the Ameritrade integration and the satisfaction of those clients in terms of the organic growth, the
capital levels and even the financial performance, and we certainly recognize the journey is not over by any
means, but we're feeling very confident about where we are and where we're going. And thanks, everyone, again,
and we'll look forward to speaking with you again in October.
