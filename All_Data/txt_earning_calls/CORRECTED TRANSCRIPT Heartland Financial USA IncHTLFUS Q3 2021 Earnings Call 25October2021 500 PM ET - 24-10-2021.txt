Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
For the next few minutes, I'll touch on the highlights for the quarter. I'll then turn the call over to HTLF's President
and CEO, Bruce Lee, who will cover business performance. Then Bryan Keag, our EVP and CFO, will provide
additional color around HTLF's results. And also joining us today is Nathan Jones, EVP and Chief Credit Officer,
who will be available to answer questions regarding credit.
Now, on to the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2021. I'm pleased to report that we had another solid
quarter. Net income in the third quarter available to common shareholders was $53.9 million compared to $45.5
million for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $8.4 million, or 18%.
Diluted earnings per common share was a $1.27 compared to $1.23 for the third quarter of last year, an increase
of $0.04 or 3%. Year-to-date earnings per share is $3.88, which is an increase of $1.29 or 50% over last year.
Annualized return on average common equity and average tangible common equity for the quarter was 10.32%
and 15.14%, respectively. And year-to-date, that's 10.95% and 16.34%, respectively. Annualized return on
average assets for the quarter was 1.19% and year-to-date, 1.25%.
Net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 3.34% for the quarter and 3.41% year-to-date. Our
efficiency ratio was 60.38% and year-to-date, 58.05%. Bruce and Bryan will share more detail on these ratios in
their comments. Well, book value and tangible book value per common share continued to increase, ending the
quarter at $48.79 and $34.33 respectively, that's a 6% and 4% increase respectively from a year ago. Tangible
common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, just short of our goal of 8% to 9% and all regulatory capital ratios
continue to be very strong bolstered by our issuance of $150 million in sub debt during the quarter.
Well, at this month's board meeting, HTLF's board of directors approved an 8% increase in its quarterly cash
dividend, raising it from $0.25 per share to $0.27 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. The
dividend is payable on November 30, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15,
2021. This marks the third increase in 2021 and results in a 35% total increase over the prior year's quarterly
dividend level of $0.20 per share. The board also approved a preferred dividend of $175 payable on January 15,
2022 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2021.
I will now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, HTLFs President CEO, who will provide an overview of the company's
operating performance and credit. Bruce?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Lynn. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you HTLF's solid third quarter results. We
continue to see strong growth across our markets and we're already seeing results from the investments we've
made in talent and technology for our lending teams. In the third quarter, total assets grew to a record $19 billion,
an increase of $625 million from the linked quarter. Assets are up $3.4 billion or 22% from a year ago. Asset
growth is driven by our strong momentum in commercial and consumer loans, and we continue to see significant
growth in deposits and service fees.
Let's start with loan growth highlights. Loans grew $263 million across our portfolios excluding PPP, an increase
of 3% from the linked quarter, exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $220 million. We saw continued strength
across our commercial loan portfolios. With the exception of construction, all categories showed growth during the
quarter. From the linked quarter, commercial and industrial increased $19 million or 1%. Owner occupied real
estate increased $195 million or 10%. Non-owner occupied real estate increased $33 million or 2%. Our Ag
portfolio increased $5 million or 1%. Construction decreased $40 million or 5%. We added 226 new commercial
relationships during the quarter, representing $116 million in funded loans and $16 million of new deposits. We're

focused on executing our talent acquisition strategy. In California, we added an agro finance team of 22 people.
It's an excellent team that includes relationship managers, treasury management officers and credit professionals
and strategically adds to our growing agribusiness in the Central Valley of California.
The strength of our agribusiness group complements our other HTLF specialized industries' teams that have
expertise in healthcare, specialty manufacturing and distribution, food and beverage and professional services.
We're also extending our reach in several high-growth markets in the Midwest. We have opened offices in St.
Paul, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids and are scheduled to open two offices in the western suburbs of Chicago
this quarter. We have added 13 commercial bankers at these locations.
Our commercial pipeline is 16% higher from the end of the second quarter, and we expect to grow commercial
loans in excess of $200 million in the fourth quarter. I'm traveling regularly and meeting with our clients and
bankers. It's exciting to see firsthand our clients' creativity, resilience and optimism. Headwinds remain and clients
are managing challenges from supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages and wage pressures and inflation.
We're very pleased with the pace of PPP forgiveness with PPP1 loans 99% of customers [ph] and dollars (09:42)
have already completed the forgiveness process. As PPP2 borrowers become eligible to apply for forgiveness,
we are seeing a steady pace of activity. We also had strong growth in our core consumer base loan portfolios
which encompasses both consumer and residential mortgage loans, increasing by $50 million from the linked
quarter and greatly exceeding our forecast of $20 million. We expect continued growth albeit at a slightly slower
pace in forecast $20 million of growth in core consumer-based loans in the fourth quarter.
Turning to deposits, non-time deposits totaled $15 billion at quarter end, an increase of $465 million or 3.2%
during the quarter. Demand deposits increased $238 million or 4% to $6.5 billion. Savings deposits increased
$227 million or 3% to $8.4 billion. We saw total deposit growth for the 10th consecutive quarter. Total deposits
were a record $16 billion, an increase of $407 million from the linked quarter and $3.3 billion or 25% from a year
ago.
Our already exceptional deposit mix improved even further, 41% of deposits are in non-interest-bearing accounts
and 93% in non-time account balances. Our deposit pricing strategy continues to serve us well. Total deposit
costs remained low at 8 basis points, a decrease from 16 basis points one year ago, helping us weather
continued pressure on our margins.
Turning to key credit metrics. Nathan Jones, our Chief Credit Officer, and his team used a disciplined credit
approach that has delivered strong credit quality across our portfolios. Non-performing loans decreased $2.1
million from the linked quarter and represented 84 basis points of total loans. Non-performing assets, as a
percentage of total assets, decreased to 46 basis points from 50 basis points in the linked quarter.
Other real estate decreased to $4.7 million from $6.3 million in the linked quarter. Delinquency ratio decreased to
12 basis points from 17 basis points in the linked quarter. Nonpass-rated loans decreased to 9.2%, a decrease of
1.2% for the quarter.
Lastly, in the third quarter, we reported a net recovery on charged off loans of $1.3 million or minus 5 basis points
of average loans. We are strategically investing for growth through our talent acquisition strategy. We have
expanded and strengthened our commercial teams. We are providing them with best-in-class technology while we
continue to engineer processes for speed and scale. We are also establishing a $15 per hour minimum wage for
all employees beginning November 1. We actively listen to our customers through our bankers in structured
research.

In partnership with [ph] Greenwich (13:40), we conduct commercial customer experience research to identify
opportunities to satisfy emerging needs. Through this dialogue, we collect market intelligence to inform our
strategies and investments. We're on track to deliver more service enhancements and digital functionality that will
enrich the customer experience. We're expanding our document management capabilities to reduce
administrative burden for our customers and bankers. We're adding more convenience features like online
appointment scheduling and live chat.
We are partnering with Temenos for robust consumer online account opening, loan origination, and digital
onboarding, and we're excited about offering custom digital experiences in the future through our customer portal
that's currently in development.
These enhancements enable us to continue to optimize our branch network. Since 2019, we have closed or
announced plans to close 23 branches or 16% of our network. Importantly, we retained 95% of the deposits from
these locations. We continue to look closely at our footprint and expect a further reduction of 7% in the network.
HTLF is in the process of finalizing an evaluation of consolidating our separate bank charters into a single charter
to drive efficiency, improve agility, reduce expenses, and enhance scalability. We are well-positioned to
consolidate our bank charters. We already successfully operate a well-integrated shared services model, and
consolidating charters will yield additional benefits, including driving efficiency and reducing redundancies
realizing significant expense savings focusing existing resources where they add the most value, simplifying
regulatory and financial reporting and adding greater capacity to better serve our customers.
Two key tenets of our evaluation are, first, our banks will maintain their brand identities and retain local decision
making, local leadership, and local boards. Second, HTLF will maintain its strong and sizeable presence in
Dubuque, Iowa. Currently, HTLF – current HTLF operational and administrative functions will continue to be
largely staffed and run from Dubuque. When completed, we expect to achieve annualized revenue opportunities
and expense reductions totaling 3% to 5% of our current cost base.
While other institutions may have achieved greater savings in their charter consolidation initiatives, our savings
may be somewhat lower as we already operate a well-integrated and mature shared services model. We expect
to communicate more details when the evaluation is complete later in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, I want to acknowledge our employees. I'm proud of how they continue to adjust, adapt and advance. I'm
grateful for their hard work and dedication. It has strengthened our company and delivered strength, insight and
growth to our customers, communities and shareholders. Together, we are HTLF.
I will now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, HTLF's Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance
and financials.

Bryan R. McKeag
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. I'll begin today by referencing our earnings release, which details another
solid quarter for HTLF with earnings per share reported at $1.27, loan growth of $263 million, excluding PPP loan
forgiveness, improved credit metrics, and continued deposit growth.
Before I go into my comments, I would remind you that you can find additional information on the quarter in the
third quarter investor presentation, which is available in the IR section of HTLF's website.

So I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which was a $4.5 million benefit this quarter and
primarily driven by improved underlying credit metrics highlighted by loan upgrades exceeding downgrades, a $2
million decrease in non-performing loans, a record low level of loan delinquencies, and $1.3 million in net
recoveries on previously charged-off loans.
The economic outlook factors used to develop the allowance were largely unchanged from last quarter and still
retained a measured level of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for lingering economic
headwinds that are yet to be resolved.
At quarter end, the total allowance for lending-related credit losses, which includes both the allowance for credit
losses on loans and unfunded commitments, stood at $131.5 million or 1.33% of total loans. When the PPP loan
balances are excluded, the total allowance stands at 1.39% compared to 1.47% at June 30, 2021. At quarter end,
unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled $21.5 million or 23 basis points of total
loans, excluding PPP.
Moving to the rest of the balance sheet. Investments grew $921 million this quarter and comprised just over 40%
of assets with a tax equivalent yield of 2.17%, a duration of just over five years, and generates $70 million to $75
million of monthly cash flow. Borrowings increased $214 million to end the quarter at $637 million or 3.36% of
assets. The increase this quarter includes both the issuance of $150 million, 2.75% fixed rate sub-debt, and the
retirement of a $21 million, 5.43% fixed rate holding company loan.
The tangible common equity ratio decreased 19 basis points to 7.89% at quarter end. The decrease was a result
of 16 basis points decline due to the decrease in market value of investments and another 26 basis points decline
due to the significant balance sheet growth this quarter. These were partially offset by a 22-basis-point increase
from higher retained earnings.
Heartland's regulatory capital ratios remain strong with Common Equity Tier 1 at just under 11.5% and the total
risk based now over 16% with the inclusion of the $150 million in sub-debt we issued this quarter. So the balance
sheet continues to be very strong and well-positioned.
Moving to the income statement, net interest income totaled $142.5 million this quarter, which was $1.3 million
higher than the prior quarter. PPP, interest and fees recognized this quarter was $11.2 million which was
unchanged from last quarter. We exited the quarter with just under $17 million of unamortized PPP loan fees
remaining on our books. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis this quarter was 3.34% that's down 7
basis points compared to last quarter. During the quarter, a 10-basis-point decline in investment yields was
partially offset by a 2-basis-point increase in loan yields and a 1-basis-point drop in interest costs. This quarter,
the net interest margin includes 8 basis points of purchase accounting accretion, which was down 1 basis point
from the prior quarter.
Non-interest income totaled $32.7 million for the quarter from last quarter, that's down $440,000 from last quarter.
Total mortgage banking revenue was up $1.2 million, which was offset by security gains, which decreased $1.3
million compared to last quarter. In addition, service charges were $400,000 higher and trust fees were up
$200,000 representing 3% increases in each category compared to last quarter.
Shifting to non-interest expense, non-interest expenses totaled $110.6 million this quarter, up $7.3 million from
last quarter. Excluding acquisition, integration, restructuring and tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, core
expenses increased just over $6 million to $108 million compared to $102 million last quarter. The increase is
attributed to several items, including a $3.4 million increase in salary and benefits costs related to the addition of
6

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
the new lending teams, some wage inflation pressure, and higher benefit costs as our employees have started to
utilize the healthcare system at more normalized levels.
The remaining increase is primarily due to FDIC insurance assessments, which rose due to higher deposit levels
and higher costs for security, legal and account losses related to increases and claims and productivity this
quarter.
Looking ahead to the final quarter of 2021 and into 2022, we believe HTLF will continue to deliver strong results
highlighted by loan pipelines that remain strong, leading to an expected growth rate ex-PPP in a 2% range per
quarter as the economy continues to strengthen. Remaining PPP loan forgiveness will happen largely over the
next two quarters. We anticipate that PPP reductions will be replaced by non-PPP growth. Non-time deposits
growth is likely to slow into the 1% range per quarter.
Net interest margin will continue to be pressured. However, net interest income excluding PPP fees is projected to
grow modestly as earning assets grow and mix improves going forward. Provision for credit losses are expected
to remain low for the next quarter or two and then begin to normalize as loan growth continues, the economy
stabilizes, and COVID and supply chain issues subside in 2022. Non-interest income, excluding investment gains
or losses in total is expected to be flat next quarter at about $31 million. We expect to see year-over-year lift in
core non-interest income in the 10% range next year.
Core expenses are expected to remain flat in the $108 million range next quarter. We intend to manage core
expenses to a modest year-over-year increase in 2022. However, persistent or increasing inflationary pressures
could be a difficult headwind. We believe a 22% core tax rate that excludes new tax credits is a reasonable full
year run rate assuming no tax law changes.
And lastly, we expect the TCE ratio will climb back above 8% next quarter as we get a 20 basis points to 25 basis
points increase from retained earnings. However, a continued upward movement in interest rates could weigh
negatively on the ratio.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bruce for questions.

Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A

Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Hi, Jeff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Just a question on the charter collapse. I guess, analysis, it's still to be determined, but there sort of the trigger
on that, I mean, that's certainly been discussed for years and you've stayed on that platform and really I guess
effectively not a lot of changes, just interested in trigger for the timing of that. I know that you've done a lot of
internal work for years now. Just wanted to kind of get a sense for the timeline of kind of why now in that
discussion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So, Jeff, this is Bruce. I think a couple of reasons. First of all, we had to make sure that we had a
foundation internally so that we could actually execute on a charter collapse. We actually have that in place now. I
think the second thing is we've gotten larger. That also was one of the factors as well, and we just felt that this
was the right time to do it, especially with the pressure on both margin and expenses that this will be an
opportunity for us to continue to reduce our efficiency ratio over time, and we've also been reducing the number of
physical branch locations as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the other thing I would add, Jeff, is when we do acquisitions, and have been doing acquisitions into our
model, a model that has one charter and the ability to do bigger deals and set them the way that we want within
the company will be easier if we don't have to worry about the separate charter demarcations. And so that will
make it easier along with other internal things in our back office.

Yeah. And just to follow up on Bryan's comment, our last acquisition, AimBank, they had geographies that
stretched across two states. So, based upon our model, we had to split their operation into our two separate
charters with some of the assets going into New Mexico and some of them going into Texas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yes. No, makes sense. Excited to kind of hear the results of that. And maybe just, Bryan, then I would – the
expense guide is maybe absent. Any decision on that to come in the fourth quarter? Is that fair to say? Or would
that have much impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. And I would say the impact is likely to come more towards the end of when we get the charter
consolidations done. So, I think it's going to be a little bit of a lag before you start to see the impact on our run rate
from the consolidation. There probably will be some one-time expenses that we'll incur to get the consolidations
done as we go through. So, could be a little lag before we see the benefit. Still working on the timing and what
other things, we have to make sure we've kind of cleared the deck of a couple of projects and then we can get
going assuming we finalize the process here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So, your modest increase in the 2022 would be absent that – and like you said, maybe some upfront costs
and the savings that you potentially identified would kind of be a 2023 event. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Late – I would say, yeah, late 2022 into 2023, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Maybe one last one on expenses. It just seems a little elevated. I know the projects that you've – and
appreciate the slide on the number of items that you're working on. Was there any lumpy pull forward in this
quarter that would suggest that tracking these projects is a little difficult from quarter-to-quarter? But was this on a
higher side? Given your guidance it sounds like flat and then moderate next year, but maybe just give us an
update on the timeline of kind of where you are on that internal spend and work on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yes, I think a couple of things. So, we still have one quarter left in 2021 and I think the consulting part, so what we
[ph] expense (31:25) as we do these projects, we'll probably have one more quarter to go, and then we expect
that should start to slow down as we really then concentrate on the charter consolidation as one of our main
projects. So that should come down. We do have a little bump up in temp costs, again, trying to get some of these
projects to completion before we start the consolidation. So, I would say those are two things that happened on
the project side, professional fees, and some of it was in the salaries and benefit line as well.

The rest of the cost increase, a lot of it was we added the landing teams that Bruce talked about. So that was one
component. And quite frankly, we have been getting a benefit from our employees not doing as much in the
healthcare area, staying at home, not visiting the doctor, not doing some of their normal healthcare. And so, we're
seeing that starting to open up. We're seeing the claims starting to pick up, and a lot of that is normal people
going back and using the healthcare system. So, those new teams and the healthcare costs, I think, are going to
stick. And so that's why I'm thinking some of this cost to be a little bit stickier than other.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think the way to think about it is if you look at the upper left-hand corner, those are the things we're really
trying to do better and those are the things that the customers are asking for first. So we really thought that we
11

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
would turn this around a little bit and not focus on what we thought the right thing to do was, but what did the
customer's expectations, what expectations do they have? And so then also on the right-hand – upper right-hand
corner, those are also things that our customers were looking for. In sort of the bottom half, a lot of this is more
on, what I would call, the efficiency side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think, Terry, just to add on that, I think what we're really working hard is to get that [ph] acquire (35:43)
and fill that top one, the account analysis that [ph] work of trying (35:47) to get done before the end of the year,
the account opening and maintenance, and the online products. We're trying to get those done before we start to
collapse the charters so that is all ready so that as the charters move together, that functionality just grows across
the footprint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think the other thing, Terry, and it goes to a little bit of the elevated expenses Bryan already talked about as well
is getting some things done first. We wanted to get the customer-facing things done first to provide value for that
customer experience. So then next year, we can really focus on this charter collapse and installing Temenos for
the – on the retail side because we believe that will be a game changer for our customers and internally.

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just one last question on expenses, the $108 million in the modest growth next
year, that modest growth up that run rate, not the full year number in 2021. Is that correct?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I would say, actually, we're trying to have it be very modest of this $108 million. Because, again, as we go into
next year, I think some of the consulting and some of the things we're doing will come off. But, again, I think it's
modest over the full year probably relatively flat to hopefully slightly down from where we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
[indiscernible] (37:44) – and as I said, the one headwind that concerns me is all the inflation that's out there and
all the wage inflation, things like that that we all in the industry are going to deal with. So, that's probably the
biggest hurdle to get where we want to go right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Certainly. Yeah. Then on the – securities portfolio continued to add some this quarter. [ph] You don't have as
(38:14) much cash as you did a few quarters ago, but what's the appetite to continue building that portfolio and
what have you been adding there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So I think in terms of growth of the portfolio, our hope is that the growth will slow considerably and maybe
flatten out as we can get this loan engine, these new teams humming. We like to be able to convert basically the
cash flow a little bit off the investment portfolio and certainly the cash flow it's coming off of the forgiveness right
until back into loans. So if we can do that, you may not see earning assets grow a whole lot for a quarter or two,
just more reposition and then after that, we should see earning assets grow as PPP forgiveness is over. And
then...
[indiscernible] (39:08)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. In terms of [ph] what we're adding (39:11), it's probably what most banks are adding, it's fairly low credit
Ginnie Maes, those sorts of things. I don't know, probably in the [ph] 1.5 to 1.75 (39:23) range in terms of yield
right now, hopefully getting a little bit better with the 10-year moving up, but we tend to play a little bit shorter of
the 10-year mark. So it helps a little bit. We really need the front end of the curve to come up for us to get the real
benefit from our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Definitely. And then the team that came over in the Central Valley, California, what size loan portfolio were they
managing at their prior bank?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then they started was it like early in the quarter or I guess when did they come on
board? And what is the – maybe is there like any restrictions on where they can try to bring over some of that
business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So they came late in the quarter. So we really – we didn't get any real production out of them in the third
quarter and they do not have any restrictions. So, we do expect to get some volume from them, from that team
even in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Great. And then, obviously, you guys have a lot going on. The charter consolidation seems to be a
pretty sizable project for you guys that you're working on. How does all of this kind of internal behind the scenes
activity is going on? How does this impact your outlook for M&A, which has been a long-standing component of
your strategy? Do you – are you guys kind of shifting towards focusing more on what you've built and leveraging
the current footprint and not relying on external growth anymore or how do we think about M&A?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that we want to do both. This is the opportunity, and we can control this. And we felt it was time
again on these projects as well as the charter consolidations. But the way that we are thinking about it, we can
still do M&A and charter consolidation and [indiscernible] (42:25) and the talent acquisition strategies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, Bryan, could you just go back and revisit your commentary on the margin
outlook and the core margin? And I may have missed what you said the impact was from PPP loans this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. PPP loans had a bigger impact this quarter, the dollar amount. So looking at non-net-interest income, the
dollar amount was the same but it had a bigger impact. In terms of the basis points, I'm thinking I did that. Hang
on here. Go through my notes. Yeah. I think had had we not had the PPP loans and you – and if you backed out
the purchase accounting, our margin would have been around 3.12%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
So it had about 14 basis points of effect this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. And then that 3.12%, can you just repeat what you were saying about your expectation in the
fourth quarter and kind of as you head into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think in the fourth quarter, I think with the – so I think of it in two different ways. I think the margin is going
to continue to be under pressure, a few basis points just because of still there's a lot of liquidity and there is the
continued loan repricing of that in the investment portfolio. But I think [ph] net interest (44:01) income dollars will
grow because we had a lot of growth come in at the end of the quarter both in the investment portfolio as well as
in the loan portfolio. And if we can – we're off to a decent start this quarter already on Bruce's $200 million
projections. So if we can keep bringing that in and get that to average, those three pieces should give us pickup in
net interest income.
The real wild card will be PPP and how much of that gets forgiven and how much of that $14 million we bring in
this quarter versus moves into next year in the first quarter. Because probably I think that $14 million or just under
$14 million, $13.8 million or whatever it is, is going to come in. I think almost all of it's going to come in the next
two quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And I guess just lastly on credit, a few quarters in a row of negative provisioning. Do you think that
you're going to need to take any provisioning here to close out the year and as we go into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I always hesitate to say yes or no because tomorrow Nathan could call me and say something happened that we
didn't expect. I would say if nothing unexpected happens in terms of non-performers popping up, new non-
performers or some non-performer [ph] giving way (45:32) worse than we thought, I think we should be – again, I
think there's still going to be net loan upgrades rather than downgrades. And I think that will largely offset the
need to provide for a loan growth component. So I'm thinking we could be plus or minus, a little bit around zero.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. All right. That's great, that's all that I had. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Jeff Rulis. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. [indiscernible] (46:10) the line a little bit with organic M&A sort of opportunities, but just at a high level,
you've seen quite a few larger bank announcements throughout your footprint in terms of not MOEs, but larger
transactions. Care to kind of comment on opportunities off of that? Or if that – again, back to that M&A discussion,
could you sit back and maybe take dislocation of other deals versus super aggressive on buying or just, I guess
16


Heartland Financial USA, Inc.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2021
the reaction of your – from your group on deals you've seen throughout your footprint, if that changes anything or
your thoughts on opportunity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lynn B. Fuller A
Executive Operating Chairman, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We continue, Jeff, to have a deep pipeline of banks of all sizes know smaller deals are difficult because
they just don't move the needle on EPS. But if they're very strategic and in our current markets, I mean, we would
look at deals that are under $1 billion. And as to larger deals, I mean we prefer to do transactions from $1 billion
to call it $5 billion or $6 billion. Those are big enough to move the needle. But again, we're focused on our current
markets in building scale and dominance in those markets. Yeah. The MOEs that you're talking about, we
wouldn't be opposed to them. But as you know, those are more challenging to put together. They take longer.
They're harder to do and you always have the social issues. So again, not opposed to it, but we look at anything
that's very positive for the shareholders, obviously.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And, Jeff, I might just – a couple of follow-ups there. Again, our strategy right now is to control what we can
control, and we think that's, first and foremost, on the talent acquisition side because that will help us grow
whether it's in California or in the Midwestern cities that I referenced. Also, we have had a lot of good hires that
we've made in Colorado, so we're really focused on growing that first. And as you mentioned, we have a few of
those particularly MOEs have occurred in our marketplace, which enables us to not only think about the talent
there, but also the customer disruption. So we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and that's what we're trying
to execute on right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Lee for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Thank you, Towanda. In closing, HTLF had a solid third quarter. We had total commercial loan growth of $214
million, consumer loan growth of $50 million. Total deposits were recorded at $16 billion. We increased our
dividend to $0.27, our third dividend increase this year. And we ended the quarter with total assets of $19 billion.
Our momentum continues. We're driving growth, maintaining strong credit quality, and investing in top talent.
We're well-positioned for the rest of this year and into 2022.
I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. Our next quarterly earnings call will be in late January. Have a good
evening, everyone.
