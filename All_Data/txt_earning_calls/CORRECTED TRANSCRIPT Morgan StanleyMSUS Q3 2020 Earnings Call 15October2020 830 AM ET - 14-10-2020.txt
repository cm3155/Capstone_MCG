Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For a decade now, we've been rebuilding Morgan Stanley
from the depths of the crisis to a firm position to withstand whatever comes our way. Our performance this year
has validated that approach, and third quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, the second highest quarterly result in
our history. The balanced business mix continues to deliver consistent results and high returns. We reported an
ROTCE of 15% with the year-to-date ROTCE of 14.3%.
On October 2, we closed the acquisition of E*TRADE, and last week, we announced our intent to acquire Eaton
Vance, which serves as the latest strategic step in our transformation. We added these acquisitions from position

of strength and we have a strong momentum across each of our businesses. Institutional Securities has been
pivotal to our performance, in 2018, 2019 and again in 2020 year-to-date extremely strong. This quarter, ISG
reported over $6 billion of revenues and $2 billion of pre-tax.
Strength in Asia, equity underwriting, and fixed income sales and trading, and our overall equities business
powered our performance. Asia had its best quarter in nearly a decade, as we continue to see the benefits of the
investments we have made in that region. Fixed income delivered the highest third quarter revenues in 10 years
excluding DVA. ISG revenues to-date are $19 billion, up 24% over last year. And we continue to believe our
Institutional Securities business has meaningful organic growth opportunities.
Wealth Management continues to grow both organically and inorganically. On a year-to-date basis, fee-based
flows have been an exceptional $53 billion with $24 billion in this quarter alone. Lending balance growth was a
quarterly record of $6 billion. Versus the prior year, lending balances have increased nearly 20%. While we did
not own E*TRADE in the third quarter, it is important to note how they performed, delivering strong client activity
and asset growth in the quarter as they have all year. With E*TRADE, our total client assets are now $3.5 trillion.
That is up from $600 billion approximately we oversaw before we bought Smith Barney a decade ago,
representing an increase of nearly 6 times.
Our Investment Management business serves as the third leg of the stool and produced over $1 billion of
revenues on its own this quarter. Assets under management reached a record $715 billion. Important to note that
â€“ that is compared to $460 billion of assets under management we had less than two years ago. Assets under
management growth has been powered by long-term net flows with over $10 billion in the third quarter, fueling of
course fee revenue growth.
While generating this strong organic growth, our recent announcement allowed us to transform our Investment
Management business, giving it scale and several incremental growth engines at one time. Frankly, it was too
good of an opportunity to pass up. For years, we have viewed Eaton Vance as the perfect partner. We will bring
together two high-performing asset managers with great business momentum. And through this partnership, we
will now manage $1.2 trillion in assets under management and generate a combined $5 billion in annual
revenues.
And to cement October 2020 as one of the most important months in our history, we received an upgrade to A2
from Moody's, the only G-SIB to receive an upgrade during the pandemic. Their recognition of the firm's clear and
consistent strategy to shift our business mix towards lower risk recurring profitable revenue streams in Wealth and
Asset Management together with our integrated investment bank is a further codification of our transformation.
So, what do the next 6 to 12 months hold? One, we will make material progress on the integration of E*TRADE.
Two, we will close and commence the integration of Eaton Vance. Three, we will reinstitute our capital distribution
plan in 1Q 2021, assuming of course we have clarity from the Federal Reserve. It is worth noting that our CET1
ratio, following the additions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, is expected to be 300 basis points above our SCB
requirement of 13.2%. Four, we will focus on driving organic business growth while managing expenses. And five,
we will ensure our culture remains firmly client-centric and grounded in doing the right thing. This includes
operational resiliency, meeting all regulatory expectations and maintaining the risk profile we enjoy today.
I will now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the results of the quarter, and together, we will take your questions.
Thank you.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Jonathan M. Pruzan
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Thank you and good morning. In the third quarter, firm net revenues were $11.7 billion with net income applicable
to Morgan Stanley of $2.7 billion. We reported an ROTCE of 15%. Our year-to-date revenues reached a post-
crisis record. Institutional Securities is having an exceptional year, capturing the elevated client activity and
managing risk well. Wealth Management is delivering stability, while the underlying indicators continue to position
us for future growth. And Investment Management is delivering growth through industry-leading long-term net
flows.
Our bankers and financial advisors are supporting our clients as they remain intensely engaged. Expense
management remains a priority. On a year-to-date basis, our firm efficiency ratio was 71%, down approximately
90 basis points from the prior year. We remain focused on our more controllable sources of spend while
continuing to support our growth initiatives, employees and communities. Non-compensation expenses increased
on higher volume-related expenses and higher unfunded credit provisions, which were partially offset by a
meaningful decrease in marketing and business development expenses. Compensation expenses increased on
higher revenues.
Now, turning to the businesses, Institutional Securities had the strongest third quarter in a decade. Equity
underwriting, corporate credit and strength in Asia underpinned the results. Clients remained engaged through the
third quarter as risk assets continued to rally through August and capital markets remained active. From a
regional perspective, Asia had a stronger quarter in nearly a decade with contributions from each of the
businesses. Heightened activity and interest in China, which saw a particular strength in IPOs and equities, drove
results. Year-to-date 2020 Asia revenues are higher than all of 2019.
Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.7 billion, decreasing 17% from the prior quarter. While fixed
income underwriting subsided and advisory revenues remained muted, equity underwriting buoyed results with
particular strength in IPOs. Advisory revenues were $357 million, reflective of lower completed M&A industry
volumes. Equity underwriting continues to be extremely active with revenues of $874 million. Results were driven
by IPOs, which nearly doubled versus the prior quarter, offsetting declines in convertibles and blocks.
Fixed income underwriting revenues were $476 million. Results were impacted by the lower levels of event-
related activity in the quarter. The equity underwriting pipeline remains healthy. We expect issuers to continue to
access the market and remain opportunistic. The advisory pipeline is recovering, as evidenced by the recent
increase in announced activity, and we have seen the pick-up in both sponsor and corporate activity.
Equity sales and trading revenues were $2.3 billion. We are number one in this business both for the quarter and
year-to-date. Results were particularly strong in Asia as well as the Americas, consistent with client interest in
higher growth regions and momentum names, respectively. While volumes declined from historic levels of the
second quarter, activity remained robust. Both cash and derivatives revenues were elevated for a third quarter.
Prime brokerage results were strong. Average balances increased as market levels rose and certain clients re-
levered with spot balances closing above 2Q period-end levels.
Fixed income sales and trading had the strongest third quarter in a decade excluding the impact of DVA, driven
by the strength in micro. Revenues were $1.9 billion in aggregate, with most products declining from an
exceptionally strong second quarter. Activity levels were healthy as clients remained engaged throughout the
summer months. From a geographical perspective, results were broad-based, and year-to-date, fixed income has
now generated over $7 billion of revenues.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Micro continued its robust performance. Bid-ask spreads remained elevated though lower than the prior quarter,
benefiting results. Performance was supported by continued strength in securitized products and credit
corporates. Macro was impacted by lower sequential revenues in rates and foreign exchange as spreads
normalized and volatility declined. Foreign exchange and rate markets continue to be range-bound.
Commodities results reflected lower activity, but were supported by strength in metals, highlighting the
diversification of the business in recent years. Our ISG loan portfolio continued to perform well. As a reminder,
over 90% of our ISG loans and commitments are either investment grade or secured. The sequential decline in
results across other sales and trading and other revenues primarily reflected lower gains, net of hedges, on our
held-for-sale portfolio due to less spread tightening compared to the prior quarter.
Our funded ISG loans declined by $2.3 billion from the prior quarter driven primarily by pay-downs in our
corporate loan book. Our funded ratio of corporate loans now stands at 15%, down from 18% in the prior quarter
and well below the 1Q peak at over 25%. We added to our reserves modestly in this quarter. Our provision for
loan losses was $66 million, down 70% from the second quarter. We had approximately $23 million of net charge-
offs primarily from one commercial real estate loan that was troubled pre-COVID.
Our allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments increased to $1.1 billion, of which our
allowance on loans now stands at $806 million. The increase were primarily driven by COVID-related sectors.
COVID-related sectors continue to represent just 10% of our total ISG lending exposures and the substantial
majority of these exposures are either investment grade or secured by collateral. Our allowance for corporate
loans increased to 4.8% and for CRE remained stable at 3.1%. Across the entire held-for-investment loan
portfolio, our total allowance rose to 1.9%.
Turning to Wealth, third quarter revenues were $4.7 billion, broadly in line with the prior quarter and up
approximately 5% excluding the impact of DCP. Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion. Our reported margin was 24%.
Merger-related expenses and a regulatory charge impacted the margin by almost 200 basis points. The
underlying indicators of this business remain robust, including record net new assets, continued strength in client
engagement, fee-based flows, loan originations and net recruiting.
Fee-based flows were exceptionally strong at $24 billion in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to-date fee-
based flows of $53 billion. Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.9 trillion, 11% higher than the prior year. In
the third quarter, transactional revenues were $880 million. Including the impact of DCP, revenues increased
sequentially, exhibiting seasonal strength driven by capital markets activity. Asset management revenues
increased 11% sequentially to $2.8 billion, reflecting higher starting asset levels on higher markets and fee-based
flows. Importantly, asset management fees are $8 billion year-to-date, a 6% increase over 2019.
Lending growth remained strong with balances exceeding $91 billion. On a year-to-date basis, balances have
grown by $11 billion with record quarterly growth of $6 billion in the third quarter. Growth was broad-based across
the portfolio. We saw strength in securities based lending, which was driven by strong engagement from ultra-
high net worth clients and by adding resources to our lending businesses. The loan portfolio continues to perform
exceptionally well. We had only $2 million in net charge-offs in the last seven quarters in this portfolio.
Forbearance continued to decline. Mortgage forbearance fell by more than half, representing less than 1% of our
portfolio, and 90-plus-day delinquencies declined to 20 basis points. Forbearance on commercial real estate loans
in our tailored lending book declined by approximately 40%. Net interest income was $889 million, declining 14%
sequentially. Higher lending and BDP balances helped to partially offset the impact of prepayment amortization
and tighter deposit spreads.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Prepay was more meaningful in the quarter, accelerating in the latter part of September as rates declined. Nearly
half of the sequential decline in NII was attributed to prepayment amortization. Total U.S. Bank deposits were
$238 billion and third quarter BDP balances were up $7 billion despite delayed tax payments. Total expenses
were $3.5 billion, in line with the prior quarter.
Investment Management results were very strong, as the business continues to demonstrate meaningful
momentum. Long-term net flows and strong investment performance has supported AUM growth, which is
translating into higher fee revenue. Revenues of $1.1 billion represented the second highest quarterly level in
over a decade, increasing 19% from a robust prior quarter. Total AUM rose to a record high $715 billion,
representing over $200 billion of growth since last year. Long-term net flows were $10 billion, driven by continued
strong investment performance in global equity strategies.
Being global remains critical. Our investment team in Asia began sub-advising a newly established ESG global
equity fund in the third quarter. It was one of the most notable fundraises in Japan in the last 20 years, and at
quarter-end, had more than $5 billion in assets under management. Inflows across all regions led to an
annualized long-term growth rate over 10% for the second consecutive quarter. Total net flows were $13 billion as
liquidity inflows moderated and investors pivoted away from money funds.
Asset management fees of $795 million increased 16% sequentially, driven by higher management fees,
consistent with strong growth in AUM. In the third quarter, we did see an increase in fee waivers on certain money
market funds as a result of the rate environment, and we expect to see the full effect of this trend in the fourth
quarter. Investment revenues were $258 million in the quarter. We saw broad-based gains across the portfolio
with sequential increase primarily driven by gains in Asia private equity funds.
Total expenses were $741 million. The increase was driven by higher compensation on higher revenues, as well
as higher BC&E expenses on higher average AUM. We are very excited about the future of this business and to
be partnering with Eaton Vance. We expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2021. We look
forward to advancing our partnership with Eaton Vance and further enhancing our Investment Management
platform.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets declined to $956 billion as funding levels declined from the highs of
the second quarter. Our standardized RWAs declined by $5 billion to $411 billion. And our standardized CET1
ratio rose 80 basis points to 17.3% compared to our SCB of 13.2%. Our board declared a $0.35 dividend per
share. Excluding $113 million of intermittent net discrete tax benefit, our tax rate was 24.3%. We continue to
expect our full-year 2020 core tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23%.
On October 2, we closed the acquisition of E*TRADE. As a function of the closing, we issued 232 million shares
and $11 billion of common equity. Our assets increased by approximately $77 billion and RWAs by $12 billion.
We created approximately $8 billion of goodwill and intangibles, of which $3 billion will be amortized over
approximately 15 years, and our CET1 ratio increased by approximately 40 basis points. Tangible book value per
share declined by approximately $4 and our book value per share was essentially flat.
As you would expect, in the fourth quarter, we will start to see merger-related expenses as we begin the
integration of E*TRADE. We will start to break these charges out in our disclosures in January when we report
year-end results. As for the operating outlook, the dispersion of potential macro outcomes remains high, and while
we are cognizant of the seasonal patterns of the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by client engagement across
all three businesses in the first few weeks of the quarter.

With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your
line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. Curious if we could talk about flows in Wealth Management. You mentioned a couple of
things, but I'm curious what you would attribute year-to-date to recruiting versus consolidation of wallet share. And
while we're on it, if you could talk about the Wealth Management loans being up almost 20%. Is that a
combination of mortgage and SBLs? Just curious what's driving that within Wealth Management.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. In terms of the flows, listen, this is a long-term secular trend that we continue to see that people want to pay
for a managed account and one fee, and we've seen this for the last several years and we now approach about
50% of the assets we manage are in fee-based accounts. It's really a combination of multiple factors, and I think
you mentioned many of them. One, we've seen more cash come into the network and that cash is being
deployed, although there's still significant amount of cash on the sidelines within our network. But we have seen
more come in and more of that's being put into the market.
Number two, your comment about net recruiting. We're seeing Morgan Stanley become the destination of choice
for financial advisors. Recruiting has been quite strong, and we brought in bigger teams over the last â€“ course of
the last nine months, and with them, they are bringing their assets which are being deployed into the fee-based
accounts. So, really a combination of those two things. And then lastly, we've seen attrition drop significantly. So,
we're not losing many assets. So, a combination of all those three things, and again, we think that's a long-term
secular trend that will continue and we'll continue to see good flows into our fee-based accounts.
And then, I think the lending growth is really, as you mentioned, those two products. The SBL product, we saw a
significant pick-up, about $4 billion this quarter. Predominantly about 70% to 75% of that came from our ultra-high
net worth client base. We've continued to invest in the platform. I think we've gotten better at using data and
analytics. We've added some more support to the field, and we've seen real receptivity around that product with
our client base. And then lastly, mortgage continues to do quite well. Interestingly, we had about 45% purchase
this quarter, which was nice to see as that has picked up as well. So, it's really both those products have been
quite strong within the footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would just add, Glenn, sort of observing it now from a little distance because I'm not directly involved in it,
this is the healthiest I have seen this business in the 14 years I've been here in terms of client flows, both fee-
based flows and absolute flows, which we historically don't break out. There were a lot of movements during the
year with tax payments and the like, but it's extremely healthy. And the attrition number is very low, as Jon said.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
So, net recruiting, better client penetration and a lot of very wealthy clients validating the model. And you add that
to the E*TRADE franchise, which has also seen very strong flows this year, it's â€“ for me, it's very exciting to see it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that. Maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. First, maybe with the core expense, you
mentioned activity levels are up. So, obviously, expenses are elevated, but marketing and T&E has been down.
Maybe if you could start with how to think about that for the go-forward on expenses. And then, I know that we
have to wait till January for your integration thoughts on E*TRADE dollar-wise. But maybe you could talk a little bit
about what you actually have to spend money on, on the integration and E*TRADE, so we can just start putting
together our thoughts on models. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Just broadly on the expense base, what we've obviously seen, given the elevated volumes, is elevated
brokerage and clearing expense that goes with the trading volumes as well as transaction taxes. As I mentioned,
Asia has been very strong. So, we've got a little bit more of a skew towards transaction taxes, and those will
continue to remain elevated assuming that the volumes remain elevated, and those generally ebb and flow â€“ or
they do ebb and flow with the volumes. We've done a really nice job of also managing our professional expenses.
We continue to try to drive those numbers down. And then, the market and business development expenses has
really been driven by just the lack of travel, the lack of conferences, things being converted to virtual, and we
would expect that to remain muted for a while. But ultimately, those expenses will start to tick up as we start to
see movement around the globe.
In terms of E*TRADE, as you know, in February, when we announced the transaction, we talked about $800
million of integration-related charges that we would incur over a three-year period. As I just mentioned, that will
start in the first â€“ this current quarter, in the fourth quarter. We'll start to break out those disclosures, so you can
see exactly what they are. We closed the deal about 10 days ago. We're extremely confident about both the
funding and cost synergies that we laid out, and we also think there's significant revenue opportunities as we get
into the integration here. So, you'll start to see that this quarter, we'll break it out, and as you said, we'll give you
some more thoughts around that in January.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, James, I wanted to start off with a question on capital. The accretion has been considerable, as you noted,
since the pandemic started, and you're clearly significantly overcapitalized. You also noted that you plan on
returning the excess possibly as early as 1Q next year, subject to regulatory approval and removal of the buyback
moratorium. How should we be thinking about the pace and cadence of buyback and your comfort initiating
payouts in excess of 100% of earnings? And just separately, how does the dividend target evolve alongside that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Few questions tucked in there, Steve. Very artful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
You're welcome. Listen, we're overcapitalized. I mean, that's the bottom line. We were overcapitalized before we
went through CCAR last time, and our SCB numbers actually were lowered by the Fed reflecting the change in
the business model. It's something that we thought â€“ we felt for a long time and it's starting to be recognized. And
even if you look at the PPNR models where we continue to argue, I think, entirely appropriately that financial
advisor compensation is a variable, not fixed expense, so it would come down as revenues come down, our
PPNR numbers would actually be healthier than they're currently showing. Eventually, I think that argument will
prevail. I hope it will prevail.
But even without that, with the accretion from the E*TRADE transaction, we're making $2.5 billion a quarter net,
and we're paying out total dividend, I think, about $2.2 billion â€“ looking at Jon â€“ maybe slightly higher. So, we're
clearly accreting a lot of excess capital, about probably $7 billion net without doing buyback on a base where
we're 300 basis points above the minimum requirement. We'll always keep a buffer. I don't know what that buffer
should be, 100 basis points probably, something like that. I'm looking at our CFO here to see if he disagrees with
me. He's sort of shaking his head sideways like he's probably a little plus on the 100 basis points. I'm probably a
little minus on the â€“ oh, he's a little minus. Okay, we're all happy.
Let's see. On buybacks, there is absolutely no reason, given Morgan Stanley's current condition, the shape of our
balance sheet, our liquidity profile and the mix of the businesses, why we wouldn't be distributing capital, except
that for right now, it's the right thing to do for the broader community as we work through this pandemic exercise
and the Fed does its pandemic stress test, which is going on right now. I'm highly confident we will come out of
that showing we have significant excess capital. I'm hopeful we'll have those results before we get into next year.
But obviously, that's not within my purview.
Given that, I would expect us to be back doing buybacks in the first quarter. Obviously, if the economy completely
tanks between now and then or if the results are less positive than I expect them to be, then all bets are off. But
that's â€“ you've got to run the business as you see it likely to be, and that's my likely scenario. How much do we
do? Yeah, you could do â€“ by definition, you could do above 100% payout. Otherwise, we'll never eat into the 300
basis points. At some point, we have to do something with this capital. Our shareholders, rightfully, who own the
company, are entitled to generate a decent return on the capital invested in the company.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
We have to do something with it. Buying Eaton Vance was a tremendous opportunity to use some of that. It's
going to hit our CET1, I think, about 90, 100 basis points, but we've accreted 90 to 100 basis points in the
meantime. So, we're sort of back to where we started, but we own a new company. That's a nice thing. So, you
can tell I'm a little animated on the subject. If you look at any of the global G-SIFIs in the US, I think it's fair to say
we are carrying the most capital surplus, and I don't think there's any rational reason why once we get through the
COVID stress test, if you will, that that will perpetuate unless we get a result which is adverse, which I don't
expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for all of that perspective, James. And maybe just a question for Jon on the NII outlook. You beat on
virtually every line item. I think NII was the lone exception. You were not alone this quarter as prepays started to
accelerate even towards the end of the quarter. But just curious, given the strength in loan growth that was cited
in Glenn's earlier question, I want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the NII trajectory from
here, whether we should expect things to start to stabilize and maybe even grow as we look out to 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Well, I think you're right, we did get hit with prepayments at the end of the quarter. I think absent that
prepayment level, we generally came in where we thought and where we had guided you to, probably a little light
as we saw some contraction in deposit spreads. I think on a go-forward basis, if we were just ourselves, I would
say we're pretty stable at this point. We obviously have reinvestment risk as the investment portfolio turns over,
but we're generally offsetting that with the growth we're seeing in the portfolio.
But as you know, we did close E*TRADE. E*TRADE comes with a large low-cost deposit base and a very highly
liquid, high-quality investment portfolio. So, from a quantum perspective, next quarter, you'll â€“ or this quarter,
you'll see the dollars of NII go up, as about half of the revenues generated at E*TRADE were from NII, and then
we're going to start optimizing their portfolio, as we laid out in February. We'll give you a better sense of sort of
what the sensitivities are around that but we're highly confident we can get the funding synergies that we outlined
in February. And that contribution of NII probably ticks up but still is going to be sort of, again relative to others,
about only 25% of the Wealth business, which again is a much smaller part of the overall company.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Steve, just back to your capital question, it's important to note that â€“ let's assume just mathematically, I don't
know, we're carrying 20% excess capital right now. 300-plus basis points on 13.2% requirement. If that's the case
â€“ and we're still generating ROEs of 13%, ROTCE of 15%. So, with that excess capital, we're generating these
kinds of returns. So, I think shareholders could sensibly look through that and project what the returns would be
on the capital we're actually using to run the business. And obviously, they're higher than where we are now.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start with one on expenses. So, at the beginning of the
year, James, you provided some targets â€“ two-year targets that focused on efficiency ratio and pre-tax margin in
Wealth. But I seem to recall that they were based on â€“ this was before all the deals. So I think they were based on
what I'll refer to as legacy MS, not pejoratively, but just for clarity.
So, I'm not trying to be nitpicky here. I just want to try and understand, is there a way we're going to be able to
track your progress in your legacy business towards those targets? Or is the idea that now that you've got so
many of these like strategic integrations that are continuing your transformation that that's sort of trumping the
work that you had previously laid out on efficiency, and therefore, it's just more important to focus on the
integration there and not the efficiency push? Just want to try and understand how to think about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure, Brennan. I think there are sort of three elements to looking at this. One is what is the â€“ as you described it,
the legacy business going to generate in terms of efficiency ratio. And right now, I think this year we're slightly
over 70%. We were less than that in Q2. We were higher in Q1, and we're right â€“ I think right on the button this
quarter. Our two-year objective was 70% to 72%, so meeting that. Our long-term aspiration was under 70%, and
we are very close to meeting that, so check the box on legacy.
Number two is what do the new acquisitions do to our efficiency ratio? If you look at the pre-tax margin on the
E*TRADE business, it's â€“ let's see, it's sort of in the 40-ish-percent range, maybe a little below that with what's
going on with net interest income. And if you look at the Eaton Vance business, it's closer to 30%. So, by
definition, if you simply added one plus one, your efficiency ratio would actually be lower. But the third bucket, of
course, is what are the integration costs.
While they don't start on Eaton Vance until we close that, which Jon said should be Q2 of next year, actually, we
had a small number of integration costs already in E*TRADE, as you know, in the last little bit, and that will build.
And I think we put out a projection of $800 million over three years. I personally would like to accelerate that. We
will probably identify it as a below-the-line number. So, just for cleanliness and for your models, we'll show â€“ you'll
be able to see efficiency ratio with and without it. But clearly, we'll talk to our accountants about the right way to
report that. But we're not going to hide the ball here. We are highly confident that absent integration costs, our
efficiency numbers, there's no reason why they don't stand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, I know that â€“ Jon, I think you mentioned that your plan is to lay out some
more specifics around E*TRADE with the fourth quarter call, which makes a lot of sense. But what's your early
read on how you're thinking about some of these changes that are likely to happen on the back of this integration?
Is the plan that the E*TRADE Bank sub will be folded into one of the Morgan Stanley bank subs? Are you
planning to integrate the BDs?

And really one of the great assets that E*TRADE brings, the stock plan business, has sort of a different focus,
more of a public plan focus. And so, the strengths are very different, but offer a nice kind of yin and yang with
Solium, which has a strong private offering. So, how do you plan to bring those platforms together? Or is the idea
that in order to fully capture the broad strength, keeping them separate is a better approach, and so it may be the
full integration is not going to be realized in order to maintain those various strengths?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. And broadly the answer, Brennan, to that question is yes. But I think the way we're thinking about it, first,
we've got to integrate the systems. We want to capture the cost and the funding synergies that we laid out. We
want to do it in a way that doesn't disrupt the customer experience and ultimately enhances the customer
experience. And then, as you said, I think we believe there are significant opportunities across all three channels
to generate growth and revenue growth, and whether that's in the stock plan business and trying to get our cash
capture numbers up to the E*TRADE numbers â€“ when we did the deal, they were running about 15%. They're
now running north of 20%. Our numbers were dramatically lower than that.
So, if we can bring the combined business together and get that to a higher level closer to theirs, that's a
significant synergy. Clearly, they are generating lots of new clients. Some of those clients are ultimately going to
want advice. And so, there are lots of opportunities across all three channels, and we'll start to see those as we
get these systems integrated. As we mentioned before that we'll keep the E*TRADE brand for the self-directed
business line, but we're going to bring these companies together slowly. This was not a deal about cost. It was
about revenue opportunities ultimately, just like the Eaton Vance deal was, and we're going to take our time,
integrate them well and bring the cultures and companies together.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
And to be clear, nothing has changed in our view of E*TRADE. If anything, it's got better. The integration plans
we've been working on for six months with Mike Pizzi, CEO of E*TRADE, who's joined our Operating Committee,
very well-thought-through plans, great detail. We'll stage the various businesses, as you highlighted, the
workplace, the banks, et cetera, and then the actual E*TRADE trading business will retain a separate identity,
because it has a very powerful brand in the marketplace. So, we are highly confident we're going to get the cost
synergies. It's just â€“ and I think we gave you that $800 million number in January or February I guess when we
did the deal, and it would be fair to say that's probably not â€“ we tend to be conservative with numbers like that.
So, I doubt we're going to be spending more than that, and the pace of the spend will be just run with the
integration plan. So, it's going exactly as we hoped it would go, but even a little better frankly.

Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, just Institutional had a very strong year and few years for
that matter, and James, you mentioned upfront you still see some good organic growth opportunities. Just given
your leading share in some of the areas, can you provide maybe a little color on just where you see some of the
attractive organic growth in that business and if that can maybe offset some of the expected [ph] moderation in it
(00:40:50)?

James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Well, firstly, doing deals in the institutional space is a little [ph] fraught (00:40:57). You're unlikely to want to
do balance sheet-type deals. I don't think anybody would be sending up balloons if we did that. And there are
obviously advisory businesses around the world that you could acquire, smaller ones, boutiques, if you like, but
we haven't found anything that really excites us yet. So, if we look at the organic growth, just look at fixed income,
and still the gap between what our fixed income business is doing â€“ which is phenomenal, by the way. From
where they've come from, it's truly phenomenal. And credit Sam Kellie-Smith and Ted Pick overseeing all
Institutional business for that turnaround in the last couple of years, just phenomenal. But they clearly have
capacity to grow in that business.
Our equities business, we lost the number one mantle for a quarter. We didn't like that. We got it back. Clearly,
prime brokerage has continued to consolidate. There's growth across prime brokerage. Our capital markets
business in Asia, particularly China-bound Asia, enormous. We have an incredible franchise there. I think there
are parts of banking we could be stronger in. We have some segments where we're very dominant. Healthcare,
tech and then some other industry groups, we could get even stronger. So, I think in DCM, we've made progress.
I think we're number five or six in DCM underwriting, Jon, and â€“ well, four actually, he's pointing to me. I think the
gap there with some of our competitors, there's no particularly rational reason why there should be a gap there.
I think there's just â€“ it's nowhere near â€“ we're nowhere near what we could be as a potential. The question is, can
we get there with the kinds of returns we want and expect from the business? So, we're quite judicious. We're not
just throwing balance sheet at it. Look at the trading VaR. I think our trading VaR this quarter was $60 million a
day and that was materially lower than our major competitors. So, we are quite judicious about it. But a series of
small steps rather than big swings is the way I'd describe the Institutional business. And they've delivered, as I â€“ I
made a point of saying in 2018 they had a record, 2019, and again in 2020 they're delivering. So, I think there's a
lot of upside. And obviously, it's also framed by the competitive landscape and what the European banks are
doing or not doing, et cetera. Jon, I don't know if you want to add to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. No, I think you've summed that up well. And I think Asia is really a bright spot for us, as I said. Year-to-date,
the revenue generation from that business in ISG now bigger than Europe. We see that as a real growth engine,
and we'll continue to make investments there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right, thanks a lot. And then, just given the recent M&A, whether it's E*TRADE in Wealth or Eaton Vance in
Investment Management, I think both make sense. Just curious on timing. Is it, obviously, you had the excess
capital, or were you seeing something from like an industry dynamic? And then more importantly, both of those
businesses are putting up good growth. So, just what do you think that business does with these transactions
obviously not over in the next 6 to 12 months, but maybe two to four years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. You were a little garbled there with the phone line. But I think the question was around the timing of those
transactions. Here's how I think about acquisitions. There are at least four things that matter. One is strategy, two
is culture, three is price, and four is timing. Strategy is like the high table, if you will, the Holy Grail. You've got to
13

have strategic intent. It's got to be a logical fit. It's got to be building on something which you already have
competence in. It's not a swing for the fences. It's not new ground. It's something we know well, we're good at,
and that's the perfect strategic opportunity comes when you get that, and we got that with E*TRADE and then with
Eaton Vance.
Culture is very important, particularly in the finance industry where a lot of deals have gone bad because of
cultural â€“ bad cultural fits, including by the way in the asset management space. And there's a fairly high
skepticism probably from all of you about large asset management deals. We thought through that a lot. Eaton
Vance has been around 94 years. We're the biggest distributor of their product. We know them extremely well.
Parametric has been an absolute home run in our system. The Calvert Funds and what they've done in
sustainability space, the fixed income combined with our fixed income business, their core equity funds, there's so
much to like about it and about their leadership team.
And I would point out that they had an internal voting shareholder structure, and all 25 of their internal voting
shareholders voted in favor of the deal unanimous. So, it wasn't just the board. It was the management. So,
culture, I feel really good about. Price is price. You don't buy quality assets cheaply. Timing is the thing least in
your control. And I am sure if we didn't do this transaction with Eaton Vance, somebody else might have. We
didn't want to do it before we had the E*TRADE thing completely done. On the other hand, we wanted to get
moving. Quality assets don't sit on the shelf for very long. They were interested in Morgan Stanley. We were
interested in them. So, timing is just â€“ timing is the thing you've got to give most on. It may not be the ultimate
convenience.
It certainly came hot on the tail of E*TRADE. We didn't want to communicate all of a sudden we're trying to do an
acquisition a week. We're not. We didn't control the timing. So, we â€“ if we got the first three right, then timing is
the least important. What it does in the COVID thing, I think, is your broader timing issue with what's going on with
the economy. Listen, their business is growing. They've had great growth. As I said, the Parametric product has
done incredibly well since it was created a few years ago. They're seeing great growth across the whole platform,
as is our asset management business. So, we really think we're putting together two strong growing businesses.
And the investment market is not going to go away whatever happens in the election, whatever happens
politically. So, I'm not worried about that over the next couple of years.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2020
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, first, 3% quarter-over-quarter loan growth is well above the industry. So, just wondered about the risk
related to that and how you're getting what others are not. Second, on the E*TRADE acquisition, the spread
revenues for E*TRADE seem like they'd be quite a bit lower. So, updates on revenue thoughts with that
acquisition. And then third, with Eaton Vance, $7 billion for a firm that's earning about $360 million. You'd have to
double the earnings just to get over a 10% ROE. So, in terms of risk, loan risk, E*TRADE risk with the spread
revenues, and Eaton Vance risk with just really getting your full money's worth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, I'll let Jon talk about the credit risk, but I would observe that we are not in the unsecured credit world. We do
not do small business lending on any scale at all. We tend to loan against people's own portfolio. So, we have
collateral and we have total visibility on the consumer side. And on the Institutional side, we're very careful about
what sectors we've been in. We're not overexposed to some of the more troubled sectors, and we have a lot of
really good clients who have been really loyal to us, have great businesses that we want to support during this
period. So, the fact our credit is performing differently from some other institutions is completely irrelevant. It
entirely depends on who you're lending to and on what terms and conditions.
So, on the E*TRADE business, yes, with the NII, obviously, that business is affected by that. On the other hand,
the account openings, the positive asset flows, the opportunity for us to provide those kinds of mortgage and
lending products to their clients, the opportunity for us to provide the alts platform on their system, the fact that
we're not spending $200 million a year building out our own digital platform, there are so many positives before
you even get to the workplace business, where their conversion rate, as Jon said, is something like 20-plus-
percent and ours has been about 3%.
So, I just think that we certainly â€“ our eye is wide open on what's going on in interest rates in this world. I don't
expect that to be a permanent state, but it's certainly not something that makes me shy about the attractiveness of
this acquisition. The underlying benefit and flows in the business have been phenomenal. And the one thing that
is actually changing people's behavior even more than what's gone on in the last five years is the increased use
of digitalization, whether it's their health services, financial services, obviously, shopping, et cetera. So, I think we
couldn't have been more blessed than to have got E*TRADE at the time we got it.
On Eaton Vance, listen, Mike, I'm not that smart. One of your colleagues on the call said that even if we paid $1
billion excess for it, at $90 billion company, it's like, yeah, it's â€“ I'm not ashamed to say it's fully priced, but this is a
quality asset. And I look at the growth rate in the asset. I don't look at the static position. We will get the expenses
out of this. We will consolidate this. We will generate the revenues from it. It fills out our fixed income asset
management business in a way that we couldn't have done otherwise, and it provides us some real growth [ph]
endurance. (00:51:06) as I said, with their core equities platform, with Parametric, with Calvert Funds, the Atlanta
Fund, they've got so many businesses that work for us.
They have very little international distribution. We can take them internationally. We have trouble getting our
product distributed domestically because we don't have a strong wholesaling sales force as others do. They do.
They have a world-class one. So, will that deal deliver? I'm positive that deal is going to deliver. And if we
overpaid by a couple of hundred million dollars, people said we overpaid Solium by a couple of hundred million
dollars. Some people said we overpaid Smith Barney by a couple billion dollars. So, I take a very long-term view
on acquisitions.

Just one more follow-up. To pull back the lens even more, over the last 10 to 20 years, you're right now reversing
some of the actions that you took. You sold off Van Kampen, and now you go ahead and get an asset manager.
You got out of kind of the mass market wealth management. Now, you're back with E*TRADE. Can you give us
kind of your big picture strategic thoughts on why the long-term reversal here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I totally disagree with what you just said. We've not had a long-term reversal. We sold Van Kampen, which I
regard as a mistake. I said it a couple of years later. I wish we hadn't done it but we did it. And I said on a call a
couple weeks ago, if Marty Flanagan was listening, I regret that, but God bless him. He's a friend of mine and I
wish him well.
We haven't got out of the mass market. And by the way, E*TRADE is a combination of a workplace business, an
active trader, options derivative business and a direct business. We have always provided financial services since
we merged with Dean Witter in 1997 to the average investor. We happen to have a lot of very, very wealthy
investors in addition, but we have millions of people with hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest, not tens of
millions of dollars to invest.
So, this is not a change in strategy at all. This is about getting scale in the businesses we want to be in. The one
thing we did differently, which I would have done differently, I've said repeatedly is Van Kampen. But you look at
some of the other stuff we did. We got out of mortgage servicing, Saxon. We got out of shipping storage and oil
storage and shipping, TransMontaigne and Heidmar. We got out of the [indiscernible] (00:53:28) PDT business,
Peter Muller's business, because it was a prop business.
So, we shut down FrontPoint, our hedge fund. We got out of Discover, which was a credit card business to the
mass market, unsecured credit. We have fundamentally â€“ and that happened before my tenure obviously â€“ but
fundamentally changed the profile of this company to focus on originating, distributing and managing capital for
individuals, governments and institutions. That's what we do, and this is entirely consistent with that, and Eaton
Vance sits squarely in that square.

...adding 650,000 retail accounts, up 14%. Cash balance is up 50%. I guess two parts to the question. I guess
first, on the flip side, you have lower rates. So, how do you think about the accretion targets given the growth
we've seen versus the interest rate declines we've seen since you announced the deal? And then secondly, how
do you â€“ what's driving â€“ I mean, obviously the markets have been volatile, but do you think that kind of account
growth can continue and is that a big surprise going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, let me start, and then I'm sure Jon will add. Listen, we're on day 10 or something here. And I know
everybody wants to fill out your models, I'm sympathetic to that. Sharon has already told me that's what
everybody is looking for. And I'd love to be able to do that for you but we're not going to do that today. They have
had unbelievable growth. I think their record new account number before this year was 93,000, and they're over
300,000 in the first quarter; second quarter, couple of hundred; this quarter, well over it. They've had incredible
asset flows into the business.
So, will that continue? I think it'll stay elevated. It won't continue at this level. There will certainly be net attrition,
because some of these accounts that were opened will close. They were smaller accounts. But they also brought
in a lot of large accounts. So, I think the answer is, Jim, it will slow, but they've reached â€“ I believe they've
reached a new baseline above where they were previously because of all the engagement around the markets.
How their P&L then plays out based on that and based on some of the mortgage and alt product and other stuff
that we put in their system and some of the expenses that we're able to take out and the funding benefits, Jon can
address that. But we'll certainly do a full update at year-end once we have an actual quarter of them sitting inside
Morgan Stanley. Jon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think stay tuned for January. But we announced this deal in February. We told you it would be dilutive in
year one, breakeven-ish in year two and accretive in year three, and we still think that that's the general
framework and we'll give you more information in January. We just started on this path. We still have high
confidence in the funding synergies, the $400 million of cost savings, and the broad outline that we outlined in
February.

really make sense to plug into this broader retail consumer base? Or is it really now just more about cross-selling
existing Morgan Stanley?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I think we've got a very full plate right now, and I think the biggest opportunity is probably putting mortgage
product to high FICO score clients with good assets at E*TRADE and putting the banking product through the
Morgan Stanley system, the digital banking to go with our already â€“ the two banks that we have. I think they are
the two obvious ones, Devin. But I'm not seeing a specific product gap. And as always, we have total open
architecture. We'll take anybody's best product, including from all our competitors, because if that's what's right for
the client, then that's the right thing to do. So, I'm not seeing a product gap.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay, terrific. And then, just a quick follow-up. I just want to make sure I'm following what's happening on the
Wealth side on the advisor head count. So, this was the first quarter of net additions in over a year. This is the
best addition quarter in five years, and I heard the comment that Morgan Stanley is a destination and also
benefiting from lower attrition. But is this quarter kind of a one-off in that evolution? Or is this something that we
should maybe focus on as a shift occurring and maybe the backlog could back that up? So, maybe just curious
kind of what the recruiting backlog looks like and if we should start to think about head count growth again on the
financial advisor side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Jon may have a comment. But it's hard to project, but the trend is definitely our friend. And if you look at the net
recruiting numbers for the last several quarters, I don't have them on hand, but I think the gap has been closing.
We've now turned positive. We're at an interesting inflection point with that business. It's got great momentum.
That's all I'll say. And the attrition, part of it, Devin, is if people aren't leaving, then by definition you're going to be
growing. But Jon, I think you've been closer to the...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think that's right. And the pipeline for recruiting certainly in the near-term is strong. We're attracting
attractive teams with good business â€“ books of business. As James said, the number of advisors, if you go back,
[ph] the JV (00:59:47) was dramatically higher or the attrition rates are quite low, and on a net basis, we're seeing
sort of flat to slightly growing numbers. But more importantly, the assets and the revenues that the new advisors
are bringing with them is going to be additive in future years. So, it's a really nice position to be in right now.

Jon, you touched on the prime brokerage results were strong in the quarter. Average balances, I think you said
increased as the markets improved and more clients became re-levered up or engage more. Can you share with

also driving these numbers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan M. Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
So, a couple of things. We did have a nice quarter in PB. You're right, balances are up from where they were.
They're still below the peak levels. We have seen the long-short hedge funds re-lever. Quants still haven't re-
levered as much as the volatility and the equity markets still remains reasonably high. We continue to see a nice
pipeline of new launches that adds to the growth dynamic â€“ adds to the growth dynamic, and it's been pretty
broad-based. So, we continue to believe, if the markets remain constructive, if volatility comes down, we'll
continue to see growth in the PB balances, which will drive revenue growth in the future.

Very good. And then, as a follow-up, I think, James, you talked about the strength in the Institutional business.
You've been very pleased with the numbers in 2018, 2019 and year-to-date. You cited some of the competitors
overseas aren't as strong. Is there any evidence yet that they are kind of getting back up on their feet [ph] and so
be a (01:01:53) more competitive environment as we look forward or do you think they're still struggling?

Well, I don't think I said that, Gerard, to be fair. I just said there might be opportunity depending what some of the
international competitors' strategies do. And clearly, some of them have chosen over the last few years to shrink
their balance sheets and go back to their core traditional banking businesses more. It's hard for me to predict.
These things wax and wane a little bit. So, I don't want to comment on their strategy, except to observe what's
happened, and that's clearly provided opportunity for some of the US banks. But that could change.

Hi. Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, a question for you, James, on M&A strategy, please. So, you
talked a few weeks ago about your disappointment at MS being trading like a bank with P/E ratio of 9 to 10 times.
And I can see how buying Wealth Management and asset management businesses like try and change investors'
perception of that. But I'd like to sort of like discuss it from a different angle. Why isn't it a better strategy to divest
CIB? It's not obvious to me that CIB has synergies with asset management and Wealth Management. You can
have the CIB trading at 9 to 10 times and then asset and Wealth Management trading at 20 times. On top of that,
you can have the bulk of the excess capital with asset and Wealth Management and that could be returned freely
to shareholders with that restriction from the Fed. So, I was just wondering what your thoughts are on that as a
strategy to maximize shareholder value.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
That's not going to happen. That's my thought about that. We have an integrated model for a reason. We have
the ballast from Wealth and Asset Management, we have the engine room. We generate â€“ originate product in
our Institutional business that helps provide enormous opportunities for our clients across the other side of the
house. There are so many synergies, Andrew, that's just not â€“ that's not even remotely close to where we think
about this business.

Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for
participating. You may now disconnect.
