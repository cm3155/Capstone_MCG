Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Kristie. Good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Who would have thought given all the
uncertainty over the past year, we would have ended the last fiscal year with record results and generated record
earnings per share and record client assets this quarter. This is a testament to our focus on executing on our
strategic priorities, which are rooted in our advisor and client focused cultures. These priorities have remained
consistent over many years. They are to drive organic growth throughout our businesses, invest in technology
and service capabilities, and to maintain focus on strategic M&A and effective integrations. Through our relentless
focus on these priorities, we have maintained long-term success across changing market environments.
Now to review the first quarter results starting on slide 4. The firm reported quarterly net revenues of $3.01 billion,
an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher asset-based revenues. Quarterly net income
available to common shareholders was $497 million or a record $2.32 per diluted share. Excluding expenses
related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $514 million or $2.40 per
diluted share, both records. We generated strong returns for the quarter with annualized return on common equity
of 19.1% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 23.8%. A great result, particularly given
our strong capital base.
Moving to slide 5. Client assets grew to record levels this quarter, driven by strong advisor retention and recruiting
results along with the strong market. Total client assets under administration increased 9% sequentially to $1.37

trillion. Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts grew to $747 billion, and financial assets under
management reached $215 billion. PCG continues to generate strong organic growth, evidenced this quarter with
domestic net new assets of $21.6 billion, representing a 7.8% annualized growth rate on beginning of period
domestic PCG assets. Advisors are attracted to our robust technology capabilities and client first values, and
through our long established multiple affiliation options, they can find the right fit for their business.
During the quarter, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels, financial
advisors with approximately $60 million of trailing 12 production and $13 billion of client assets at their previous
firms. These results do not include our RIA & Custody Services businesses, which also continued to have a
recruiting success and finished the quarter with $147 billion of assets. Despite strong recruiting activity, the
financial advisor count was sequentially flat, mostly due to an elevated number of retirements, which are
seasonally higher in the first quarter but where the firm typically retains the vast majority of assets through
previously established succession plan. In addition, advisors moving to our RIA channel are excluded from the
advisor count since they no longer carry a FINRA license with us.
We announced that the President of our PCG Independent Contractor Division, Jodi Perry, transitioned to a newly
created role of National Head of Advisor Recruiting. Jodi has generated outstanding results in every role she has
held in her nearly 30-year career with Raymond James. And I am confident she will continue to strengthen this
key growth engine for the firm. This key leadership appointment continues to highlight the importance and focus
on advisor recruiting. With this transition, we are excited about Shannon Reid becoming the PCG Independent
Contractor Division President and joining the firm's Executive Committee. Shannon has most recently served as
Senior Vice President of our Northeast division. She has an impressive background and has been a stellar leader
in an important market.
Total clients' domestic sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion, up 3%
over September 2023. Balances were boosted by growth in both the Enhanced Savings Program as well as the
client sweep balances. Bank loans increased 1% from the preceding quarter to a record $44.2 billion, although
loan demand remains relatively muted, given higher rates.
Moving to slide 6. Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $2.23 billion and pre-tax income of
$439 million. Year-over-year results were driven by higher Asset Management fees, reflecting 18% growth of
assets and fee-based accounts. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $338 million
and a pre-tax income of $3 million. Investment banking revenues grew 15% compared to a year ago quarter due
to higher M&A and underwriting revenues. Sequentially, robust fixed income brokerage revenue growth largely
offset weaker M&A and affordable housing investment results. While fixed income results were stronger during
the quarter, investment banking activity industry wide appeared to be on a gradual recovery. The uncertain
market environment, along with the impact of the amortization of share-based compensation granted in the
preceding periods, has strained the near-term profitability of segment results. We remain focused on managing
controllable expenses.
The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $93 million on net revenues of $235 million.
Results were largely attributable to higher financial assets under management compared to the prior year quarter
due to market appreciation and net inflows into PCG fee-based accounts.
The Bank segment generated net revenues of $441 million and pre-tax income of $92 million. Bank segment net
interest margin of 2.74% declined 13 basis points compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to a higher
cost mix of deposits as Enhanced Savings Program balances that replaced a portion of lower RJBDP cash sweep
balances.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
Now, I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of the first quarter results. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Starting on slide 8, consolidated net revenues were $3.01 billion in the first quarter, up 8% over
the prior year, and down 1% sequentially compared to the record set in the preceding quarter. Asset Management
and related administrative fees grew 13% over the prior year and declined 3% compared to the preceding quarter.
The sequential decline was largely the result of lower fee-based assets at the beginning of the quarter compared
to the beginning of the preceding quarter. This quarter fee-based assets increased 9%, which will be a strong
tailwind for Asset Management and related administrative fees in the fiscal second quarter. Brokerage revenues
of $522 million grew 8% year-over-year, mostly due to higher transactional activity in PCG. Sequentially,
brokerage revenues increased 9%, the result of higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues as client
activity increased and the trading environment was more favorable. I'll discuss account and service fees and net
interest income shortly.
Investment banking revenues of $181 million, increased 28% year-over-year. Sequentially, the 10% decline was
driven predominantly by lower M&A revenues. We are cautiously optimistic that the environment for M&A is
improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity.
However, there remains a lot of uncertainty and we are hopeful a gradual recovery will lead to better results over
the next six months to nine months. Other revenues of $38 million were down 30% compared to the preceding
quarter, primarily due to lower affordable housing investment revenues compared to the seasonally high fiscal
fourth quarter.
Moving to slide 9, clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program balances ended the quarter at
$58 billion, up 3% compared to the preceding quarter and representing 4.8% of domestic PCG client assets.
Advisors continue to serve their clients effectively, leveraging our competitive cash offerings. Many clients have
now taken advantage of the attractive Enhanced Savings Program and other high yielding products. Thus, the
pace of flows into this program has decelerated as we expected, growing approximately $900 million or 7% this
quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming into ESP has been new cash brought into the firm by advisors,
highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and
stability. While we are encouraged by the modest sequential growth of client cash balances during the quarter,
which was helped by seasonal tailwinds in the fourth calendar quarter, we continue to expect some further yield
seeking activity by clients. Through Monday of this week, sweep and ESP balances are down approximately $1.5
billion for the month of January, primarily due to quarterly fee billings of $1.35 billion.
RJBDP sweep balances with third-party banks were $17.8 billion at quarter end, up 12% from September 2023.
The strong growth of Enhanced Savings Program balances at Raymond James Bank has allowed for more
balances to be deployed off balance sheet with third-party banks. While this dynamic has negatively impacted the
Bank segment's NIM because of the lower cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately
provides clients win an attractive deposit solution, while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility by providing a
large funding cushion for when attractive growth opportunities emerge. Looking forward, we have ample funding
and capital to support attractive loan growth.
Turning to slide 10, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $698 million, down
2% from the preceding quarter due to lower firm wide net interest income resulting from NIM compression, but
outperforming our expectations on the last earnings call, as client cash balance were more stable than we

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
expected at that time. The Bank segment net interest margin decreased 13 basis points sequentially to 2.74% for
the quarter, and the average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 6 basis points to 3.66%.
While there are many variables that will impact actual results absent any changes to short-term interest rates, we
currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be about 5% lower in
the fiscal second quarter compared to the fiscal first quarter. Just based on spot balances, after the fee billings
this quarter and our expectation of some continued client cash sorting activity.
Hopefully, we can outperform this expectation again this quarter, but we believe it's prudent to air on the side of
conservatism given the continued uncertainty around client cash balance trends. We remain focused on
preserving flexibility and growing net interest income in RJBDP fees over the long term, which we believe we are
well-positioned to do.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 11. Compensation expense was $1.92 billion, and the total
compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.8%. Excluding acquisition related compensation expenses, the
adjusted compensation ratio was 63.4%. Looking ahead, the impact of salary increases effective on January 1
and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter.
Non-compensation expenses of $462 million decreased 20% sequentially, largely due to elevated provisions for
legal and regulatory matters in the preceding quarter whereas this quarter was a relatively quiet quarter for legal
and regulatory reserves.
The Bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter declined to $12 million. I'll discuss more related to the
credit quality in the Bank segment shortly. We remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest
in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients. For the fiscal year, we expect non-
compensation expenses excluding provision for credit losses, unexpected legal and regulatory items or non-
GAAP adjustments to be around $1.9 billion. This implies incremental non-compensation growth throughout the
year as we continue to invest in growth and ensure high service levels for advisors and their clients throughout
our businesses. And remember, many of the non-compensation expenses such as investment sub-advisory fees,
represent healthy growth that follows the corresponding revenue growth.
Slide 12 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we generated a pre-tax margin
of 20.9% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 21.7%, a strong result given the industry wide challenges impacting
Capital Markets. As a reminder, our current targets provided at our Analyst and Investor Day last May are for a
pre-tax margin of 20-plus percent and a compensation ratio of less than 65%. We still think these targets are
appropriate and we will provide an update as needed at the next Analyst and Investor Day, scheduled for May 22.
On slide 13, at quarter end, total balance sheet assets were $80.1 billion, a 2% sequential increase. Liquidity and
capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, well above our $1.2
billion target. And we remain well-capitalized with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.1% and a total capital ratio of 23%.
Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation
that vested during the period. Going forward, we still believe that 24% to 25% is an appropriate estimate to use in
your models.
Slide 14 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the quarter, the firm
repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $150 million at an average price of $107 per share. As of
January 24, 2024, approximately $1.39 billion remained available under the board's approved common stock
repurchase authorization. Our current plan, which is subject to change, is to repurchase at least $200 million of

shares in the fiscal second quarter to complete the remaining repurchases associated with the dilution from the
TriState Capital acquisition. Following the second quarter, we expect to continue to offset share-based
compensation dilution and to be opportunistic with incremental repurchases.
Lastly, on slide 15, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank
and TriState Capital Bank. The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total
loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.09%. The Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage
of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.08%.
The Bank loan loss allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for
investment was 2.06% at quarter-end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we continue to
closely monitor economic factors that may impact our corporate loan portfolio, including the commercial real
estate portfolio. Within the CRE portfolio, we have prudently limited the exposure to office loans, which represent
just 3% of the Bank segment's total loans.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. As I've said at the start of the call, I am pleased with our results for the first fiscal quarter,
generating record earnings per share and ending the quarter with record client assets. And while there is still
economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the
long term across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, next quarter results will be positively impacted
by the 9% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. Near term, we expect some headwinds to the
interest sensitive earnings at both PCG and the Bank segment given ongoing cash sorting activity and uncertain
rate environment. However, we are already seeing some of the higher yield competitor rates coming in.
Despite this, I believe our effort and focus on being a destination of choice for our current and prospective
advisors will continue to drive industry leading growth. Our advisor recruiting activity remains robust, including a
record number of large teams in the pipeline.
In the Capital Markets segment, we continue to have a healthy M&A pipeline and good engagement levels, but
our expectations for a gradual recovery are heavily influenced by market conditions, and we would expect activity
to likely pick up over the next six months to nine months. And the fixed income business, we saw improvements in
this quarter with higher activity, but the dynamics of the past year persist.
Depository clients are experiencing flat to declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in
securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we
will start to see an improvement. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we believe Capital Markets business
is well positioned for growth once the market and rate environment become conducive.
In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter up
9% over the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues. We remain confident that strong
growth of assets in fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of
financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help
drive further growth over time.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
In the Bank segment, we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and
prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen security based loans payoffs decelerate and
are starting to experience growth. We expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with
the current level of rates.
With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been muted. However, spreads have improved, and
with ample client cash balances in capital, we are well positioned to lend once activity increases in our
conservative risk parameters. In addition to our focus on organic growth across our businesses, we have also
ramped up corporate development efforts.
In closing, we are well-positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with strong competitive positioning in all of
our businesses and solid capital and liquidity base to invest in future growth. As always, I would be remiss if I did
not thank our advisors and associates for their continued dedication to providing excellent service to their clients.
Thank you for all you do.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. For my first question, I just wanted to touch on net new assets.
And clearly, there seems to be a pickup in NNA and you continue to call out a robust recruiting backdrop. And the
question is, what do you think is driving that NNA acceleration now? And how much do you think a more stable
macro outlook could contribute for NNA acceleration from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, historically, like this quarter, it's a pretty good NNA number. So, what's really driving it is still great retention,
recruiting and most of our recruiting, the advisor count number is a little misleading now because we're recruiting
more and more larger, very large teams, fewer number, but larger teams. This quarter, we had a lot of
retirements, but the retirement seasonally we do at the end of the year. But in retirements, almost all of them have
transition plans, so we keep the assets, which drives the advisor count number down. And when people transfer
to the RIA division, which happens every quarter, we take them out because they don't have a FINRA license.
So, if you look at the net asset, net new assets, you go over the last few years, and then we continued to be near
the top of the market or at the top of the market, and it's really just a great retention and robust recruiting. And as
we recruit larger and larger teams, a lot of those teams are – their businesses are still growing significantly and it's
really generating net new assets. And, of course, there's market health, right? As the market goes up, you bring
people over the assets are higher.

So – but we feel pretty comfortable and as we announced we brought over Jodi Perry to really even add more
robustness to our recruiting efforts which were diversified or spread out between the channels, but really bringing
them together to a more unified effort, we think we can do better than we have been doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Y. Cho Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. No. Thanks for all that color. I just want to switch gears on the Capital Markets segment, specifically
investment bank, I mean, you continue to invest in talent there despite the choppy backdrop over the last 18
months. And I think you've called out a higher-quality bank or higher-producing bank or Raymond James now
versus previous periods. I mean, how should we think about something like revenue per MD going forward in a
more normalized environment if the backlog starts to flow through at some point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, back in the last – the peak of the last market, we exceeded $10 million per MD. So, I mean, we generate a
very, very high productive number. If you go back a few years, we're a couple of million dollars per MD and that
really is the difference, so part of that's the market. But certainly part of that was the high quality MDs recruited
and the teams that joined us.
So, I don't know what that number is in a good market. I think we could still produce that number or better. We
continue to recruit people in some of the businesses that we felt were subscale or didn't have the senior people
that we wanted. And I think the productivity is still there. So, if we had a market as robust as we did couple of
years ago, we could top that $10 million, but certainly we'd be much higher in the high-single digits, I think in a
reasonable market. But again, the market, as we've said, is we see slow improvement, but nothing that's really
moving quickly up but moving up steadily.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
So, first question, if you could go back to your early calendar 2023, you guys had built a fair amount of liquidity
and maybe gave up some interest income short-term and I think the view was that lending spreads could widen
out and so you wanted to have some capacity and obviously, this was also a reason to be conservative at that

Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
time. But it did seem like some of that maybe the headwinds to spread revenues was more of a timing dynamic
and intentional.
So looking at today, you still have a lot of excess liquidity to grow loans if you see attractive risk adjusted return.
So, I'm just curious if kind of that view still holds that you had kind of through most of calendar 2023? And then
are those better spreads materializing as maybe you thought they would or are you still waiting for that? I'm just
trying to think about the interplay with that and then accelerating lending activity into that as well? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think there's two pieces to that, Devin, is that we have seen spreads widen. The problem is that the
market hasn't been really robust in the area that we like to lend in. We have a target both in industries, borrowers,
it's fairly conservative. And that pipeline of new loans that you can see from other banks too has just slowed
down.
So, we're still waiting for that kind of resurgence in activity, which we think will happen at some point. But that's
really been the – we're ready to lend. We're also seeing that SBL loans and things which was deteriorating. We've
seen that the payoffs are really decreasing. We're seeing some growth there now, too. So, we're starting to see
the beginning of growth in those portfolios, but certainly, the market isn't giving us that opportunity to put on loans
at the same rate we did in like early 2023 or certainly 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks, Paul. And then just a follow-up on the institutional fixed income brokerage, obviously, really
material improvement in the quarter and you're kind of run rating over $400 million, last year you did mid-300s.
And just looking at like 2023 relative to 2021, you're down over 30% even though you have SumRidge today and
arguably a bigger, better business. So, what do you think about kind of the some of the momentum that you saw
in the quarter, depositories are maybe becoming more active again? And just how to think about kind of what a
normalization in that business looks like. Is it the call it a little bit over $400 million run rate that we saw in this
quarter? Is it something better? And is this quarter kind of a good jumping off point because it is such a stark
change from the prior quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, it's first a pretty fickle market. SumRidge has done well the whole time. They traded on volatility. So, if
you look at volatility, you could probably look at their results, they're really good, very hedged, very focused
corporate trading strategy and consistently have executed since day one, and their business has not been off. It's
done well.
Our traditional depository business, which is a big part of our franchise, as they got cash squeezed, it slowed
down. Two things were happening. A lot of banks already had plenty of fixed rate maturities, and they weren't
looking for more bonds, and they were worried about their liquidity. I think what happened in December, as
liquidity looked like it was easing some and rates look like they were going to come down, they got much more
active.
So, I think that environment, which has been okay beginning of the year, but it's too early to tell is what happens
with rates if people really think these are fixed rates and liquidity continues to feel settled, they'll get more active
10


Raymond James Financial, Inc.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
or at least be active as they are today. But I don't see the return of two years ago until the market really gets a lot
better and a lot stable. They performed very, very well. And it's just – if rates go up, it's going to be a headwind. If
rates go down some or the view of rates going down materializes or people get confident, I think it will pick up.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good evening. Wanted to follow up on your comments around cash sorting and your expectation that you
expect that to continue. And curious if that's just some of the seasonal cash coming back into the market that
maybe built up in December and or what other factors you think that are going to continue to have that be an
ongoing trend beyond the billing and other things you mentioned so far in January?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. You touched on them. I mean, we in the December quarter typically have sort of seasonal tailwinds with tax
loss harvesting maturities and those type of things. And then throughout the year, quarterly fee billings alone this
quarter were north of $1.3 billion and we'll hopefully see that continue to grow throughout the year. And then we
also have the headwind as we enter April with income taxes as well.
So, rates are still high there, out there, they've come in a little bit, as Paul said, just with the expectation for lower
rates. So, we have seen some declines across the industry, but really money market funds are the yields, they
are really the biggest competitor we have, if you will, and those yields are still attractive. And so, we still have to
have attractive alternatives to bring in new cash to compete against the money market fund.
So, as I said in the last couple of calls, I think we're much closer to the end of that cash sorting dynamic then we
get closer and closer, I feel like, every quarter. But we're not going to declare that it's over until we have several
months of history to prove it out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And I think that people look at kind of the data there is, I'll say if rates come down well before that spread increase
quickly. Well, on normal sweeps, they kind of follow Fed funds, but really, if you look at money markets, they're
more, they're buying bonds and it takes two weeks to three weeks for them to adjust. So, if there are – if you
consider them some of the competition for rate, it's going to take a few weeks at least for that to sort through
before there's – yeah, before rates start moving at the more expensive people who are investing in higher yielding
types of certificates, but it'll be moving in the right direction of rates [indiscernible] (00:37:40).

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thank you. And then just as a follow-up within PCG, insurance and annuity products have been growing and a
bigger contributor. Just curious with the DOL's proposal, how you think that these products might be impacted or
momentum that might be impacted by the proposal?

So, first, there's always been scrutiny on those products over time and we believe we have good products and
systems to manage that. And the DOL, we have put in systems to comply with a fairly similar law in the beginning.
And then we had to take them out, as the industry defeated the rule. The second interpretation of questions came
out and the industry defeated the rule. So, we'll have to see in court and we'll have to see what this rule finishes
with before we look at the impact and my guess is the industry will challenge the rule again.
So, we've won twice. Well, my guess, I think there'll be a substantial challenge with a lot of things that could
challenge what is proposed today and so we'll have to see. So, I'm kind of early to speculate on that, so it's
finalized until we see if it really can withstand the third court challenge.

Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good evening. Sorry about that. So, first on the balance sheet, just given how much sweep cash you have
sitting off balance sheet at this point at $18 billion and the excess capital you're currently running with combined
with the shape of the forward curve, would you consider beginning to grow the securities portfolio again over the
next few quarters and start to lock in some yield? Or do you still have a preference to allow that to run off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Kyle, our position on taking duration on the balance sheet has remained very consistent through different
rate cycles, which certainly positioned us well this time last year which is really to keep more of a floating rate
balance sheet and not try to time rates one way or the other. To the extent that we do take duration on the
balance sheet, we really want it to be to support and accommodate client needs in our mortgages and those tax
exempt loans, et cetera.
And so, we're really not looking to try to time what might happen to rates. I know the forward curve has been
wrong more than right in the last two years to three years and this misguided a lot of other firms. And so, we're
just going to remain flexible and really focus on accommodating clients versus making bets for our own benefit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
And we've heard a lot of people speculate over at the top rates, but we went from no rate cuts to three to people
speculating six to speculate, well, maybe we won't get one per month, so we just don't want to really play that
game. And I think one of the key is to our consistent performance is we're not making bets, we're just consistently
running the business. So, we really don't look at locking in rates like that. And right now, the spread, on the sweep
rates is very, very good and compelling anyways. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Understood. Maybe just a question on the non-comp expense guidance of $1.9 billion, I think that implies a
10% increase or so in the average non-comp expenses for the remaining three quarters versus the first quarter
run rate. I know there are some variable expenses that you laid out in terms of the investment advisory fees, but
just wondering if you could expand a bit on some of the other areas where you may be ramping investments
through the remainder of the year?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. This quarter was pretty low almost across the board. IT, the technology expenses, we typically pull back on
external support during the December quarter just because it's a little bit slower, for those vendors as well even to
bring people in. It's a relatively quiet quarter for conferences and trips. And so, we – and it was also a relatively
favorable quarter for legal and regulatory.
And so, I think as the year progresses, we should expect to see growth to get to that $1.9 billion sort of guidance.
And as a reminder, that excludes some of the non-GAAP items which most of you exclude as well as the Bank
loan loss provision and unexpected legal and regulatory reserves, because it's just hard, it's impossible for us to
try to forecast those over the next three quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
That was kind of our initial guidance was the $1.9 billion . So, we're just – it is lumpy, but we still think that's a
good number.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious if you could maybe disclose what portion of your client
asset bases is in retirement accounts? And also, when you think about recruiting, typically how much of those
assets tend to come in, in the form of retirement accounts, IRAs and the like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We will provide more of that breakout at our Analyst Investor Day in May. When we last went through this
in 2016, last time we disclosed this metric, it was about a third of the assets were in IRAs and retirement
accounts, but we haven't provided any real disclosure on that since then. So, we'll plan on doing that at the
Analyst and Investor Day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that, Paul. And then when you think about NNA had a nice jump here this quarter, was there
Bank activity within the Bank channel here in the quarter that might have caused some of the significant quarter-
over-quarter changes? And generally, what's your outlook for growth coming from that channel in the near term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
There wasn't anything lumpy in the Bank channel. We – that tends to be a lumpier one just because of the – with
advisors, there's many, many, so they average out with the Banks. We don't expect anything lumpy. It's part of
our growth platform. And I think our NNA has continued to be very, very solid. So, we like the trajectory. And this
is, I think, a very strong number both given the environment and given our competitors this quarter and still
believe we have opportunity to keep. We don't forecast a number, but I think we can be right at the top of NNA.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Okay. Thank you very much. Good evening and I appreciate taking the questions. Maybe to mix up the topics a
little bit, just wondering if we could circle back to capital return, just given the fact that you have a very strong
capital position, you mentioned sort of mixed dynamics on the loan side or lending side. Why not pick up the pace
of capital return through buyback? And then maybe as a subsector to that, what's your incremental thinking of
inorganic opportunities at this point and what might you be looking at? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So, we think, first, we were a little late into the quarter because we had a self-imposed blackout given – we said
given an accrual for our off-platform communications, so we got a little late jump. And so, we weren't in a rush.
We had a good period in that market, so we didn't try to catch up. But we're committed to next quarter, the $200
million, which I think will catch us up on the TriState commitment and continue on our dilutions. As we go forward
to be opportunistic, we are trying to balance. As we've said, we put a new head of corporate development. We're
seeing a lot of opportunities in the market. And we want to make sure that just like I remember the timing, two
years ago, people were saying are you ever going to spend the cash, we got over 12% and we did six
acquisitions in 18 months, right, and got our ratio down to 10%.
So – and the reason we could do them is we have capital on the balance sheet and we think there are
opportunities, the problem is you never know if they're actionable. You can talk a lot, but we're certainly out in the
market and looking. And so, we just try to balance those two. The good news is, we have strong earnings, so we
understand we'll keep adding to the capital base, but we were just trying to balance the two of them. We think
$200 million is a good target. And if we can't get – if we get to the point where we don't think there are accretive
acquisitions that would be accretive to the positioning of the firm, not just earnings, we will buy back stock. We're
not trying to hoard capital. Our RSUs, at least half of them are ROE and TSR base. So, we're not trying to hoard
capital just for fun. We just think it's the right thing to do looking at the potential opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Katz Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Okay. Just a follow-up, maybe talk about margins for a moment. I appreciate that, we will look forward to the
Investor Day in the spring. But just conceptually though, to the extent that the investment banking backdrop were
to pick up, how do we think about the incremental margin in both the segment and how that might translate down
to the holding company? At this point in time, obviously, you're running about breakeven, if you will, I'm just trying
to think through the puts and takes of some pressure on NII, offset by maybe a little bit more countercyclical pick
up in the [ph] iBank (00:47:57) and how that might filter down to profitability? Thank you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Bill, I think, in the Capital Markets segment, when they were operating at record levels over the last couple
of years, two years ago, they, I think had a maximum margin or a record margin of around 26%. And so, that just
shows you the upside potential for that segment. And now it's both, the equity side and the fixed income side of
the business running on all cylinders, which is somewhat atypical across the industry just given the
countercyclical nature of some of those businesses. But there's a lot of upside from just breaking even this quarter
in Capital Markets to what the potential is and that we proved out couple of years ago. And that obviously would
help the overall margin of the firm. We're still saying it's a 20%-plus margin target for the firm at this juncture. We'll
update that as appropriate at the Analyst Investor Day in May. But we have a diversified business.
So, there's always puts and takes. And what we don't try to do is sell you on a story that's just at the incremental
margin of everything happening to the plus side without factoring in potential offsets. And so, we think that's a
more balanced approach. But obviously, all else being equal, if we have the same exact sort of performance from
the other businesses with the upside potential of Capital Markets, that would be accretive to the margins overall
for the firm. But we're just reluctant to guide that now, given all the uncertainty, particularly around cash sorting
dynamics, which is a huge driver of margins, the cash balances and where interest rates are as a big driver of
margins for the firm. So, we're going to be conservative there until things stabilize.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good evening, Paul and Paul. I wanted to start off with a question on deposit betas and pricing flex amid rate
cuts. Just one of the challenges that we collectively are grappling with is that your mix of deposits is quite different
than peers. You have a lower concentration of higher beta savings deposits that should carry very high deposit
betas with rate cuts. At the same time, your current payout on your sweep deposits is actually much more
competitive than your peer set. So, I was hoping you could frame separately what your expectation is for deposit
pricing flex on the [ph] ESPPs (00:50:36) versus the sweep deposits within the Bank channel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we – see ESP balances, we would expect the correlation or the movement of those rates to be
much more aligned with what happens with Fed funds effective. And I think that's what advisors and clients
expect, not only at Raymond James, but across the industry as well. for those higher yielding products. You say
it's different in terms of mix of deposits than others in the industry, but you also have to remember with the
TriState acquisition and they have $18 billion of deposits now, which are higher cost deposits and a likely higher
beta deposits too, both on the upside and on the downside of rates.
So, it gives us more similar sensitivity than just looking at the sort of PCG related deposits, which we feel good
about. And then as you point out, the BDP, the sweep deposits, we were much more generous than most of our
competitors on the way up, which gives us more kind of cushion on the way down as well with those deposits. So,
as Paul said, it's going to be a competitive dynamics, something that we'll look at as rates move, but we feel really
good about the position we're in right now.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great color, Paul. And for my follow-up, it's related to what Bill had just asked, but I was hoping to pin you
down with an explicit number in terms of how to think about incremental margins, because the offset from lower
rates is clearly expected to come from the Capital Markets side of the business. The concern is that NII is non-
compensable, but if we actually look at what you guys did during the period of robust Capital Markets activity, you
cited the 25% plus type margins. The incremental margins were actually close to 50% during that period. So, just
want to get a sense, if we do have a more meaningful ramp in Capital Markets activity, is 50% incremental margin
a reasonable assumption consistent with what we saw during the COVID period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I guess what I would say is if you kind of look at the revenues now versus the revenues of the peak
of Capital Markets and being breakeven now versus getting a 26% margin during the peak of Capital Markets, I
mean, it's pretty linear. There's a lot of incremental margin as you grow revenues from the current base to where
we were at that point in time. So, it also depends on, frankly, the mix of revenues in Capital Markets, how much
comes from M&A versus underwriting versus fixed income. All those businesses have different incremental
margins too.
So, we can make up a simplistic number for modeling purposes. But frankly, I think it'd be false precision. And we
also know that the dynamics that may help the Capital Markets business may be dynamics that may positively or
negatively impact our other businesses. So, we're generating a 20% plus margin and generating record earnings
in the last three years in very different market environments. It's something that really reinforces the value of
having our diversified business model and being able to generate adjusted returns on tangible common equity of
over 20%, 23% this quarter on our strong capital basis without the support of Capital Markets is something we're
really happy about.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good evening. Maybe just a quick question on the brokerage sweeps. Your yield went up, net yield went up
again. You've had pricing power. How long do you think the pricing power can last, I mean, deposits in the
industry have seemingly stabilized for banks, does that start to erode some of that pricing power, what's your
outlook on the sweep pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. We're still seeing a lot of demand for these deposits across the banks that we deal with. So, we still think
that there's pricing power. But in fairness, the pricing power we're talking about is 5 basis points to 10 basis
points, which on the balances of $17 billion is meaningful, but it pales in comparison to what's happening with the
base rates nowadays, so – and what might happen going down or up. So, we still think there's pricing power.
There's a lot of demand for these deposits. But we're hopeful that over the next year or two, we're using more of
these deposits to grow the balance sheet and support clients with loan activity, which generates higher yields and
returns for the firm overall.

Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Great. Make sense. And then maybe as a follow-up on just sort of the large team pipeline sort of at a record, I
think you highlighted that last quarter as well. How much of that is – what is your win rate among the large teams?
Do you feel like it's getting better and how much is in the pipeline versus actually in the door, I guess, when I think
about just as you win new mandates and new client and FAs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know if I have those exact numbers. I will say, no, we didn't see $10 million teams a year or two to
go. Now we see $20 million and $30 million teams that are – the batting average is pretty good, but there's a lot of
competition. We're not the highest payer, but we're still doing really, really well. We have a lot in the door, but right
now we'll stay in the pipeline and I'm committed we're in the middle of – we're right there neck and neck and
we're, I think we have a pretty good read on who will come in or not or who are close and you stay at it.
So – but it's a large number and we're actually honestly a little surprised. I think it's both the growth of our firm and
our platform, the high net worth initiatives that we've had and what we've built really since [ph] Alex Brown
(00:57:00) has joined us with their help being a place for people in the high net worth, ultra-high net worth, feel
very comfortable. And then our technology and our systems and culture, it's all combined to add – added to a
place where frankly, if you'd have asked us a couple of years ago, we would say that we wouldn't have told you
[ph] we would have (00:57:20) expected $10 million, $20 million, $30 million teams, multiple teams, at one time.
So, our job is to get them in the door, right? So, the good ones. And so, that's what we work hard on.

Mark McLaughlin Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I was curious, how do you view your use of
transition assistance and loans to financial advisors? I know some of your competitors use that a lot in terms of
generating growth. How do you view your competitivity in that space?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. First everyone uses them. So, if you want to recruit with zero transition [indiscernible] (00:58:05), I mean,
you might bring some people in, but not much. I mean, advisors feel there's a value to their practices and want a
fairer return on those. So, that is part of recruiting for all the firms, not so much in the RIA channel, but certainly in
the employee and independent channel.
We've consistently, since my time and before, have not been the highest on purpose. And we want – we've
always said it's part of self-selection that we want people to come because they believe it's the right place, not for
the highest check. Now, having said that, in last few years, transition assistance has gone up. So, we've had to
make adjustments, but I mean we're rarely ever the highest offer. I mean, we rarely match the highest offer and
we still have a very good batting average so – but it's part of the business.

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Paul, I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit
on the comment you made earlier to Bill's point around building excess capital position. In fact, the last time you
guys were at over 12% Tier 1 leverage, you went out and did a significant number of deals. So, maybe articulate
a little bit more what the M&A pipelines look like for the business today and what areas within Raymond James
look most interesting from an inorganic perspective? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Well, honestly, there's a lot of opportunities in all of our business segments. We think there's an organic
opportunity. So, the challenge is you just don't know. Some are on the market, many we keep in touch with and
say is this a good time for you to look at teaming with us versus competing with us. And I think during the last year
with everything going on, discussions are up now when you can close those or when they're actionable or and
frankly, in this market where you suffer a little bit from what our own M&A business does, that the sellers price
expectations adjust much slower than the buyers do.
So, just taken in our industry with cash sorting, right? We've always said conservatively we'd expect cash starting
to continue, which it has over the last year. And many people are saying, well, cash sorting is over and this should
be our – this should be the EBITDA you value us on.
So, we just say, no, we don't think so. And so, part of that sometimes solves over timing or part of that people say,
well, at this valuation, we're not going to sell, and that happens with all the segments, but the number of dialogues
are up. The interest, I mean, sustained dialogue and some we walk from, some they walk from, some we just say,
hey, maybe it's not the right timing price-wise and that was no different than the dynamic a few years ago and
then all of a sudden, four we were after for a while and two came out of blue almost that we found all closed. So,
we can't predict that timing and don't want to even try because there is nothing concrete to predict it. But when
there's enough activity, you want to make sure you have enough capital that if that time does come that you could
execute.

Michael J. Cyprys Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to come back to some of your comments on the
recruiting backdrop. I was hoping you might be able to elaborate a bit on the competitive environment today
versus, say, 6 months or 12 months ago for recruiting and how you might expect that to evolve if rates come
down over the next year or two.

Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Recruiting, my 15th year, I think in this role. I mean, since I've been here, everybody told me recruiting was going
to slow down and it's just picked up. The aging advisor, there'd be been no more advisors left and we see teams
in their 40s that have bigger books than we've ever seen before. So, I think the recruiting potential is going to stay
there. I think we have a unique value proposition given our size on one hand with – and our A ratings across the
three rating agencies, our capital. On the other hand, allowing independents and freedom advisors to own their

books, so they can leave if they want to leave. The technology platform and wealth, we think, is second to none.
And that's what the industry awards would say.
So, you got to keep competing and it hasn't slowed down yet. Probably the biggest change the competitive
landscape, it's been RIA roll-ups that pay prices, that we can't quite figure out and it's a bit on aggregating and
being able to go to market some point even though those private multiples are much higher than the public
multiple. So, that's a new competitor, which kind of led price. Now, people are selling their firms versus having
people still kind of owning their businesses.
So, that's the newest dynamic. And in an area, which is I call a new competitor, but again, it's the advisor's choice,
right, how do they want to practice. If they want to own their business and get all the support of leading
technology for a great place, if they want to sell their business at a pretty high multiple to roll-ups, so we're trying
to aggregate and monetize later. I mean, that's certainly a viable market option. That wasn't really there for years.

Paul C. Reilly
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
All right. I just want to thank you all for attending. I think we're in great shape with certainly good tailwinds with that
asset number being up 9%. The markets maybe surprised us all, continue to be robust, but if they continue, we're
in great shape there and the cash dynamic will sort itself at some time. If the forward curve is right at all, even if
it's delayed, that will ultimately be a tailwind when that happens. But right now, we just as you know, we're
conservative. So, we always look at it, as I kid Paul about this 5% decline in the last few quarters. We haven't
quite hit that yet and you get it again, but we don't know. So, we try to be conservative and if rates do moderate or
come in, then that will get some tailwinds there for the industry. So, thanks for joining and we'll talk to you again.
