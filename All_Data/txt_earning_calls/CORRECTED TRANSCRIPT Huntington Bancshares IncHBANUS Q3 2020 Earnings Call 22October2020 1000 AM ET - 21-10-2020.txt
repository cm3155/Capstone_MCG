Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's
strategy to build the leading People-First, Digitally-Powered Bank in the nation, which the board affirmed this year
in our multiyear strategic planning process. Huntington strategies are delivering long-term revenue growth. As our
third quarter results demonstrate, we're driving revenue growth despite headwinds of the current environment.
We're focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and
share of wallet. We are investing in customer-centric products, services and infrastructure that will drive
sustainable growth and outperformance, both today and for the years to come. Huntington has built a competitive
advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services. We are
committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking app, which has been honored by
J.D. Power two years in a row and our online banking, which was Number 2 in this year's J.D. Power study.
In the past few weeks, we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our
customers' needs and differentiate Huntington from our competition. First, we extend a 24-hour Grace to
businesses. We then introduced our no fee overdraft fee $50 Safety Zone for both consumers and businesses.
And finally, earlier this week, we announced our latest innovation, Huntington Lift Local Business, a $25 million

micro-lending program that capitalizes on our best in the nation SBA lending expertise to better serve minority
women and veteran-owned businesses.
We've intentionally diversified business models, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides
diversification of revenue and credit risk. We have a proven track record of solid execution, adjusting our
operating plans to the environment in order to drive shareholder returns. This has allowed us to deliver seven
consecutive years of positive operating leverage and I expect 2020 will be our eighth. This focused execution has
and will enable us to ensure investment in the products, people and digital capabilities that will drive sustainable
long-term growth and outperformance.
Turning to slide 4 for an update on our digital and brand strategies. Following the completion of the FirstMerit
acquisition in 2016, we began the evolution of our consumer go-to-market strategy from being branch-centric to a
powerful multi-channel model that includes leading digital channels.
We introduced The Hub, which forms the backbone of our award-winning mobile app and our online banking
platform. That evolution has accelerated this year with increased customer adoption of mobile and digital products
and services, and we are successfully driving digital sales and originations, as well as changing and expanding
the branch experience to include virtual and digitally-assisted delivery.
Our brand sales activity is almost back to pre-COVID levels. It's about 95% today, but we're seeing an
accelerating evolution the way our customers use branches. Simpler transactions are rapidly moving into faster
and easier mobile and digital venues. This transition is allowing our branch bankers to focus on providing more
valuable advice and focusing on deepening our customer relationships, all ways of looking out for our customers.
As we've discussed previously and as shown on the bottom of the slide, Huntington regularly evaluates and
optimizes our branch distribution. Since the completion of the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016, we've reduced our
branch count by 263 branches or 24%. This includes the consolidation of 99 branches or 9% as part of the
integration, the sale of 32 branches in Wisconsin and the consolidation of an additional 132 branches or 4%
annually on average since 2016.
Last month, we announced the planned consolidation of 27 additional branches or 3% in the 2021 first quarter.
We're pleased with the high retention levels post-consolidation of deposits due to the strong foundational
relationships with our customers and the close proximity to other Huntington branches as we've maintained our
branch share position in almost all markets. This thoughtful branch network optimization strategy allows us to
continue to capitalize on our competitive advantages around convenience, our brand promise, and customer
service.
If you did not listen to Andy Harmening's presentation on our digital transformation at an investor conference in
early September, I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website where you can listen to the replay and
see the presentation materials. I believe our digital strategy and our execution of that strategy is generating
industry-leading results.
We delivered very strong third quarter results, including a record level of pre-tax pre-provision earnings, thanks to
the continued solid execution across the bank in the face of the continued challenging operating environment.
I'm particularly pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth as earning asset growth more than offset NIM
compression to drive spread revenue modestly higher, while fee income growth was bolstered by the second
consecutive quarter of record mortgage banking income.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
The performance of our home lending team was outstanding, as they originated more than $3.8 billion of
mortgages for the second consecutive quarter. To frame that for you, our previous high watermark for any quarter
was $2.5 billion of mortgage originations in the fourth quarter of last year. Our combined mortgage production
over the past two quarters was greater than we did in all of 2018 and roughly the same as in all of 2019.
So, these accomplishments were the direct result of the successful build-out of this team and our investments and
our digital mortgage lending platform over the past several years. We're well-positioned to capitalize on the
current mortgage environment and the near-term outlook remains strong. Given the prolonged low interest rate
outlook, we've implemented a comprehensive action plan to stabilize the NIM near current levels over the long
term. Zach will cover this and more in his remarks.
We continue to closely manage our expenses. A significant portion of the year-over-year increase in expenses
resulted from restructuring cost related to implementation of expense management program we announced last
quarter and elevated variable cost to support our record home lending business volumes. As we previously
discussed, our efforts have been to manage expenses so that we can allocate investments to our strategic growth
initiatives.
Looking forward, we remain optimistic of the continuing economic recovery. The unprecedented level of
government stimulus has supported both individuals and many companies. And we're very pleased with the
number of customers exiting forbearance arrangements.
Our consumer lending businesses, which as you've seen in our quarterly origination statement provided for over a
decade, are focused on super prime customers and they're performing very well. Mortgage, auto and RV/marine
are all continuing to post strong originations. Commercial lending has been restrained by the economic
uncertainty with many customers shepherding elevated levels of liquidity, paying down revolvers, and putting off
new investment spending.
We continue to see improvement in commercial pipelines that we mentioned last quarter. And based on the
conversations we've had with our customers, we expect these levels of elevated liquidity to persist for some time.
We're cautiously optimistic that C&I loan growth will improve later this year and early next year.
The timing of forgiveness around the PPP loans remains uncertain. But I would like to take a moment to share
that Huntington is the nation's largest SBA 7(a) lender for the third consecutive year in the SBA's fiscal year-
ended September 30. We're the largest 7(a) lender in our footprint for the 12th year in a row. Small businesses
are such a vital component of our economy and the nascent economic recovery as they consistently account for
the lion's share of jobs created in our country. Particularly in this pandemic, these businesses deserve and need
our support, and I hope these businesses are the focus of any future government stimulus package.
Our third quarter credit metrics reflect stable to improving trends across most portfolios and include elevated
charge-offs from the sale of more oil and gas loans. During the quarter, many customers successfully exited prior
pandemic-related deferral programs. The underlying portfolio metrics reflect our continued expectation for
outperformance through the cycle. Our credit loss reserves take into consideration the economic uncertainty that
we continue to have the virus both in duration and severity. We believe we're adequately covered should the
pandemic continue to prolong the economic recovery.
Our capital ratios remain within our targeted ranges. This morning we announced that the board declared the
fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, unchanged from the prior quarter. We're currently
5

finalizing our submission for the off-cycle CCAR. We are seeking approval and expect to increase our capital
return to shareholders in 2021.
In closing, I'm encouraged by the momentum I can see building across our businesses. Our colleagues are
actively engaging with our customers and prospects. Customer activity is improving month by month. We see
improved debit card activity. Sales activity in the branches is almost back to pre-COVID levels. And our pipeline
has been replenished in many of our businesses over the past several months.
We recently made some key additions to our commercial team, notably within our asset finance, capital markets
and corporate banking teams, and have conversations ongoing with additional revenue producers. We're
receiving very, very positive feedback and early results from the new 24-Hour Grace for business and the $50
Safety Zone product features for consumers and businesses that we rolled out in September.
Our credit quality through the early months of this pandemic has held up well and we're confident in the quality of
our loan portfolios. I'm conscious that the economic outlook remains somewhat uncertain in the near term, but
overall I like what I see and I'm optimistic about our outlook over time.
Now let me turn it over to Zach for an overview of financial performance. Zach?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the 2020 third quarter.
We reported earnings per common share of $0.27. Return on average assets was 1.01%, and return on average
tangible common equity was 13.2%. Results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision
expense as we added $57 million to the reserve during the quarter.
Now let's turn to slide 6 to review our results in more detail. Year-over-year pre-tax, pre-provision earnings growth
was 2%. We believe this is a solid performance in light of the current interest rate environment and uncertain
economic outlook. Total revenue increased 5% versus the year-ago quarter due to strong fee income growth
paired with modest spread revenue growth.
As Steve mentioned earlier, home lending was a particular bright spot this quarter, driving a record $122 million of
mortgage banking income. We also saw deposit service charges and card and payment processing revenues
rebound off of the 2Q lows as customer activity continue to rebound and pandemic-related fee waiver programs
expired. I should also note that deposit service charges remained below the year-ago level as elevated consumer
deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line.
Total expenses were higher by $45 million or 7% from the year-ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, approximately 2
percentage points of this growth or $15 million was driven by restructuring costs from our 2020 expense
management program. Another 3 percentage points or $18 million was related to year-over-year increases in
commissions, overtime, contract help and other variable costs in our home lending business, driven by the record
level of mortgage originations. The balance of the expense growth, approximately 2% reflected a sustained level
of investment in our strategic priorities, including digital and mobile technologies.
Turning now to slide 7. FTE, net interest income increased 2% as earning asset growth more than offset year-
over-year NIM impression. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.96%.
As shown in the log on the right side of the slide, the linked-quarter increase included a 7-basis-point benefit from
our hedging program, including the full quarter impact of the $1.6 billion of forward starting asset hedges that
6

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
became active in the second quarter. There was also a 2-basis-point benefit during the third quarter related to
changes in balance sheet mix and other items. These two positive impacts were partially offset by the elevated
balance sheet liquidity that contributed a 7-basis-point incremental headwind in the third quarter.
As Steve mentioned, we're taking decisive actions to maintain the net interest margin near current levels. While
we are diligently working across the organization to identify and pull levers to manage the margin, it's important to
note that our core optimization objective is revenue growth with the highest possible return on capital within our
risk appetite. That said, NIM is one of the key drivers of that return and revenue growth. So we're actively
managing various levers to stabilize the NIM as a key component in that calculus. We expect to continue to
optimize our funding costs including further reductions to deposit costs and optimizing our wholesale funding.
On the earning asset side, we're currently in the midst of a broad reexamination of all business and lending
commercial relationships for repricing opportunities that I believe will yield several basis points of incremental NIM
over time, as well as associated deepening of noninterest income fee opportunities.
Similarly, we are optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing loan production in certain higher yielding asset
classes such as small business, residential mortgage, asset-backed lending, equipment leasing while
deemphasizing growth in some of our thinner priced lending products.
Finally, our comprehensive hedging strategies continue to provide some relief from the yield curve as we expect
they will continue to do for the next several years. While this hedging benefit will begin to gradually wane over the
next several years, there are no looming cliffs as we have strategically built a well-laddered hedging portfolio.
Moving to slide 8. Average earning assets increased $11 billion or 11% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven
by the $6 billion of PPP loans and a $5 billion increase in deposits at the Fed. Average commercial and industrial
loans increased 13% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans.
During the quarter, C&I benefited from a full quarter's impact of the PPP loans. However, downward pressure on
the business and commercial utilization rates especially within dealer floor plan more than offset this, resulting in
a modest linked-quarter decline. Consumer lending has also been a bright spot this year as indirect auto,
residential mortgage and our RV/marine portfolios have posted steady growth, a trend we expect to persist in
coming quarters.
Turning to slide 9, we will review the deposit growth. Average core deposits increased 14% year-on-year and 2%
sequentially. These increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to the PPP loans and
increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn. Consumer growth largely related to the
government's stimulus and increased consumer and business banking account production and reduced account
attrition.
Like the industry as a whole, this very strong core deposit growth of the past several quarters has resulted in
significantly elevated levels of deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. These elevated levels of liquidity have
proven to be much stickier than we anticipated and our revised outlook is that they are likely to persist for several
quarters before these customers deploy the funds. While this did pressure the Q3 NIM more than originally
expected, it is also providing us the opportunity to more aggressively manage down our deposit costs going
forward.
Slide 10 highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations,
and debit card spend, as these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity amongst our customers. And
7

you can see on the top-left chart, the decline in commercial loan balances, excluding PPP loans, leveled-off in
July and remained relatively flat during the third quarter.
Early stage pipelines are refilling, providing room for optimism of a return to new commercial loan growth later this
year and into next year. We expect this coupled with the expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization
rates and the typical seasonal build in dealer floor plan will provide some offset for the headwinds from PPP loans
as they are forgiven and repaid over the next several quarters.
The top-right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors I've mentioned
previously, providing attractive source of liquidity during these uncertain times. The bottom two charts relate to
customer activity driving two of the four key fee income lines for us. Mortgage banking salable originations remain
robust, although there has been a very slow decline since the peak in June. As we mentioned on the second
quarter call, debit card usage quickly rebounded once the economy began to reopen and we continue to see
healthy year-over-year increases in both transactions and dollar spend.
Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio or
CET1 ended the quarter at 9.89%, relatively stable with last quarter. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE
ended the quarter at 7.27%, again in line with last quarter. Both ratios remain within our operating guidelines and
our strong capital levels position us well to execute on growth initiatives and investment opportunities.
Let me now turn it over to Rich Pohle, to cover credit. Rich?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Zach. I'd first like to reinforce the steps we've taken over the last several years to position us for this
downturn. In commercial, we scaled back leverage lending, healthcare construction and commercial real estate.
We stopped originating oil and gas loans about 18 months ago and have reduced that portfolio to well under 1%
of total loans.
We have also repositioned our business banking portfolio with a significant reduction in commercial real estate
exposure and a shift toward SBA as about 20% of our loans are now SBA as opposed to only about 5% heading
into the last downturn. We were the number one bank in the entire country last year for SBA 7(a) originations for
the third consecutive year. On the consumer side, we have continued our focus on prime and super prime profile
customers and leveraged our expertise in auto into our RV/marine business.
Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or ACL
from year-end 2019 to the third quarter. You can see our ACL now represents 2.31% of loans and excluding the
PPP loan balances, our ACL would be 2.5% as of September 30. The third quarter allowance represents a
modest $57 million reserve build from the second quarter.
Like the previous quarters in 2020, there are multiple data points used besides the provision expense for Q3. The
primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the August baseline forecast. This scenario
was somewhat improved from the May baseline forecast we used in Q2 and assumes elevated unemployment
through 2020 ending the year at 9.5% followed by a slower paced economic recovery through the first half of
2021 that accelerates as the year progresses.
2020 GDP ends the full year down 4.9% and demonstrates 2.6% growth for all of 2021 with that growth also
accelerating in the back half of the year. While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have
8

improved, as have our credit metrics for the quarter, there are still many uncertainties to deal with, a likely COVID
resurgence in the winter, a stalemate on additional economic stimulus, the impact of the upcoming election, as
well as ongoing model imperfections relating to the COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining
coverage ratios consistent with the second quarter is prudent when considering these factors.
Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs, and demonstrates the continued impact of our oil and gas portfolio has had
on our overall level of NPAs. Oil and gas NPAs at Q3 represented 26% of our overall NPAs, which we're down
from the second quarter by $111 million or 16% as we proactively reduced the oil and gas portfolio and we're able
to return other credits to accruing status.
Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided on our commercial
customers. As we forecasted on our Q2 call, the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now totaled
just $942 million down from $5 billion at June 30. About 80% of the remaining deferrals represents second 90-day
deferrals that are centered on hospitality, retail, and travel related customers. Over 70% of the remaining deferrals
expire this month and we expect to have limited commercial deferral balances at the end of Q4. Some SBA
customers might seek an initial deferral in Q4, following the end of the six-month payment support the SBA
provided under the CARES Act. Commercial delinquencies are within a normal range at 19 basis points,
reinforcing the deferrals have not negatively impacted credit quality.
Slide 15 shows our consumer deferrals and the news here is good as well. Our auto, RV/marine, and HELOC
portfolios are performing as we would have expected with very modest post-deferral delinquencies. In fact, nearly
all the auto, RV/marine, and HELOC deferrals have lapsed and we are operating in a pre-COVID risk
management environment with respect to those portfolios.
The mortgage accommodations have come down 78% since June and are also meeting our expectations.
Request for second deferrals or further modifications equal just 10% of the post-deferral population today.
Mortgage deferrals will remain elevated for the next quarter or so given the longer initial deferral period 180 days
in many cases versus 90 for other loans, as well as the more formal deferral exit process which requires a second
round of documentation with less signatures and notaries. Like the commercial deferrals, the consumer deferrals
are not indicating additional credit risk at this time. Consumer delinquencies were down across all loan categories
on a year-over-year basis.
Slide 16 provides an update to the industries hardest hit by COVID-19. We continue regular reviews of our
commercial loan portfolio and we believe we have the risks identified and appropriately managed. Any adverse
COVID impacts as well as the most recent SNC exam results are reflected in our crit/class and other credit
metrics for the quarter.
As we have previously mentioned, our hotel exposure is centered on five primary sponsors with most of whom we
have enjoyed long-term relationships including through the last downturn. These sponsors continue to
demonstrate the financial strength to see their way through the longer-term recovery period we forecast for this
industry. Our restaurant exposure is primarily in the national quick service brands. We believe this book to be in
very good shape overall, but we'll continue to closely monitor the heightened risk in the single location and other
non-franchise names in the portfolio.
There are currently no material credit concerns in the other high impact portfolios. And you can see that the credit
metrics since June are relatively stable. Recall in the second quarter as part of our active portfolio management
process, we evaluated the COVID-19 related impacts across all portfolios and took appropriate actions to

downgrade those severely impacted credits to criticize status. This review resulted in a significant increase to our
criticized asset level in Q2.
I am pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $425 million or 12% in the third quarter
validating that the portfolio review we undertook in Q2 was comprehensive and served to identify potential
problems early. Working with our customers, we were able to proactively remedy a number of these loans.
Slide 17 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was
strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 56 basis points of average loans and leases. The commercial
charge-offs were again centered in the oil and gas portfolio, which made up approximately 44% of the total
commercial net charge-offs. Like Q2, nearly all these oil and gas charge-offs resulted from $127 million of loan
sales closed or contracted for sale during the quarter as we've prudently reduced our exposure to this industry.
Annualized net charge-offs, excluding the oil and gas related losses, were 36 basis points, demonstrating that the
balance of our portfolio continued to perform well in Q3. Consumer charge-offs were just 24 basis points in Q3,
highlighting our strong consumer portfolio. Our super prime originations of auto and RV/marine loans in particular
continue to perform at very high levels. I would also add, our non-performing asset ratio decreased 15 basis
points linked-quarter to 75 basis points. As always, we've provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst
package in the slides.
Let me turn it back over to Zach.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Rich. As Steve alluded to earlier, we have confidence in our businesses and are cautiously optimistic
that the economic recovery will continue, particularly longer term, as we move past the election and with a
potential for vaccine and improved therapeutic medical treatments for the virus. We also expect to finish out 2020
strong. And slide 18 provides our expectations for the full-year 2020.
Looking at the average balance sheet for the full-year 2020, we expect average loans and average deposits to
increase approximately 6% and 10% respectively compared to last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect
consumer loans, more specifically residential mortgage, auto, RV/marine to be the primary driver of average loan
growth as commercial loan growth remains muted. Our current projections assume the majority of PPP balances
will remain on balance sheet through the end of the year.
With respect to deposits, we expect continued growth in consumer core deposits from new customer acquisition,
relationship deepening and low attrition. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the elevated level of business and
commercial deposits to persist through year-end. We expect to record full-year total revenue growth of
approximately 3% to 3.5% and full-year total expense growth of 2% to 2.5%.
With respect to revenues, we expect Q4 revenues to be in line with Q3, up 7% to 8% year-over-year. We expect
full-year NIM to be approximately 300 basis points, and we expect a flat to moderately higher NIM in the fourth
quarter, driven primarily by further reductions to the cost of interest-bearing deposits, which we expect to be
below our prior historic low of 22 basis points that we set back in the third quarter of 2016.
This guidance includes no positive impact in Q4 from the acceleration of PPP fees and includes a continuation of
elevated liquidity that we discussed earlier. We expect full-year noninterest income growth of 8% to 10%, primarily
10

driven by robust mortgage income, while our fourth quarter outlook includes moderation in mortgage banking, we
expect an uptick in capital markets fees as well as several other fee lines to help to cushion that decline.
On expenses, we expect the fourth quarter to be up 3% to 5% from the third quarter. As we've discussed before,
we believe the current economic outlook presents the opportunity to invest in our businesses meaningfully gain
share and accelerate growth over the moderate term as the recovery continues to solidify.
As such, we're accelerating investments in technology and other key strategic initiatives across our businesses as
we exit 2020, while delivering full-year positive operating leverage for the eighth consecutive year.
Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full-year net charge-offs to be approximately 50 to 55
basis points. This is reflective of the cleanup of the oil and gas portfolio, as well as the broader economic
conditions.
Now, let me turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions.

I appreciate – hey. I think you guys actually answered a lot of my questions on the sort of the potential for
commercial to kind of resume some growth. I certainly appreciate that. I wanted to ask specifically on the dealer
business that's been kind of a headwind. And granted it's not necessarily huge for you guys, but was just curious
to hear about your thoughts on sort of any window I guess to how quickly we should expect that dealer business
in particular to recover. In other words how much of a growth driver can it end up being?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Hey, Scott. It's Rich. I'll take that. We've seen really low utilization rates across the dealer floor plan portfolio.
What has been typically in the 75% range are now down below 50%. The challenge with that business is just
getting inventory back on the lots. And while the OEMs are ramping up deliveries to the dealers, new car levels
are continuing at pretty low levels.
So, we would expect that we will see a steady build from that 50% up towards the end of the year and provide a
gradual build over the year. This isn't something that's going to ramp up very quickly, but it is going to be
something that we see steady state and slowly building throughout the balance of 2020 and into 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then Zach just on the guidance for the full year and I guess implicit in the fourth
quarter. If I'm doing the math correctly, I think the implied NII in the fourth quarter would be up fairly significantly
from the third quarter. It sounds like margin is sort of flattish. I guess just what are the puts and takes that you see
for NII in particular in the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. Thanks again for the question. So, I think our outlook for loans sequentially is up in total about 1% or $800
million. And we are expecting our kind of baseline underlying forecast as a couple basis points of incremental NIM
as we go into Q4. And so, that's really going to drive spread revenues up sort of around $30 million. To be clear, it
does not include any PPP acceleration. There could be some revenues coming through from that, but we're not
banking on that.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A question for either Rich or Zach on the provision. Can you talk about some of the provision drivers for the
quarter and what you want the overall message to be as we look forward on that? It seems like some of this was
growth driven as well, but can you just talk about provision drivers and expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure, Jon. It's Rich. I'll start with that. Yeah, as you pointed out, we did have a relatively modest reserve build in
Q3. It was about 3% from Q2. The coverage ratio moved up 4 basis points from 227 basis points to 231 basis
points. I would first point out that we did have over $1 billion in point-to-point loan growth in Q3, which accounted
for about 25% of that reserve build. Clearly with CECL, you are taking a life of loan approach to any portfolio build
that you have.
But I would tie the build really to ongoing uncertainty with respect to both the virus and the type of stimulus if any
that's coming our way. We are seeing COVID-19 cases increasing across much of our footprint and while we
don't expect a return to full stay-at-home orders, we do believe that that is going to be a drag on the economy
going forward. And with respect to stimulus, we can see that there's a deadlock right now and the timing and the
makeup of what that stimulus ends up looking like is going to be important to the recovery.
I think you have to keep in mind too that all of the economic scenarios have assumptions with respect to both the
dollar amount and the timing of stimulus. And to the extent that that stimulus is delayed or isn't earmarked for
where the model thinks it's going is going to have also an impact. So, when we look at factoring all of that in, the
uncertainty that's what really drove us to keep the reserve about where it was, I think 4 basis points is pretty much
a plateau for the quarter. Those were the big drivers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
But the message I hear is adequately reserved for what you see today. I've heard that a couple of times, is that
fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. That's – absolutely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital
Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one small one. It's a noise in your numbers at this point, but quarter, your nonperforming,
about half the charge-offs were oil and gas. Zach, you used the term cleanup. What's left there and what's kind of
the timing on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We have hedge – we sold $127 million in the third quarter. We've got that portfolio down 50% from where it
was a year ago. When we talk about cleanup, the book right now is at a point where with the reserves that we
have we will be opportunistic sellers. I think over the course of the last several quarters, there was more of a
13

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
desire to get the overall numbers down and the pricing that we were able to get allowed us to do that within the
coverage ratio that we had.
I don't believe in the fourth quarter that we're going to be aggressive sellers. We will certainly look to sell it if it
makes sense. And to the extent that the borrowing base redeterminations require additional charge-offs, we'll take
them. So, we're going to move into what I will consider more of a traditional problem loan management scenario
with oil and gas going forward.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Steve, my first question is for you. Out of all your DFAST participant peers, I think this is probably the first
statement we've heard in terms of expectations to increase capital return in 2021 assuming restrictions don't
stretch out for too long. And knowing the bank, you've always prioritized dividend, dividend growth and also of
course funding your growth. And I'm wondering if that balance shifts a little bit to buybacks in 2021, given where
your stock is relative to your return potential.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thank you, Erika. We do have a relatively high dividend yield compared to the peer group and that will influence
at the appropriate time I believe our board's decisions. We would be more oriented towards buyback versus a
dividend increase, but no decision we're not at that threshold yet. But the historic guidance we would have
provided will substitute – will likely substitute other uses of capital as a second alternative and that dividend is
balanced with that. Historically, we'd have said core growth dividend and other uses, you'll see a much more
balanced approach. Certainly with the stock trading at these levels that seems to make a lot of sense to us.
Again, subject to Fed and other regulatory support.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And my second question is for Zach. I think, of course, there was some chatter about swap income
potentially rolling off and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there are no looming cliffs. And if I'm doing
a back of the envelope math, right, the derivative book helped net interest income about maybe $19 million to $20
million this quarter and course correct me if I'm wrong. And I'm wondering as we think about the outlook for 2022
in your well-laddered strategy, what is the dollar impact from the derivative portfolio? If you could confirm for this
quarter and what you expect it to be for 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Probably the dollar [indiscernible] (00:41:12) basis points. In 2020, for the full year, the derivative portfolio
is benefiting us by about 22 basis points. Next year, we expect that to rise somewhat, several basis points up to
25 basis points. And then it sort of gradually runs off through 2022, 2023, and 2024. I think 2022, it's about 12
basis points to 13 basis points run off. 2023 is about 7 basis point run off, and the 2024 is actually flat.
So there's no massive cliff. There's clearly a drop and a gradual reduction over time. But as I also mentioned in
my prepared remarks, we're pulling all the levers of balance sheet optimization to really offset and drive that and
we do have confidence, we'll floor that in near term levels over the long term leveraging the three key strategies,
funding optimization, asset growth mix, and that customer level pricing.
Lastly, I'll say, just pull back and see if that answers your question is, for next year, there will likely be a fair
amount of quarter-to-quarter volatility driven by PPP loan forgiveness acceleration we'll see, but we suspect that
that will be in the first couple of quarters.

Following up on the expense side, Zach you mentioned 3% to 5% expense growth in the fourth quarter. And I
think you said it was mostly investment. Just wondering, can you help us just to understand what were the
restructuring cost that were in the third quarter number and also what you're expecting in the fourth quarter
number?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. In the third quarter, we had $15 million of restructuring costs. In the fourth, we expect that to be kind of
around or just less than $5 million. So, the incremental $10 million benefits quarter-to-quarter within that 3% to 5%
expense guide. I would tell you just pulling back that really the investments are essentially entirely driven by that
investment growth, so the expenses are essentially driven by that investment growth. We see a little bit of
continued quarter-to-quarter growth in variable cost is driven by customer activity continuing to rebound out of the
COVID lows, but those are the main drivers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then so, if I take that, then there's not much restructuring costs in that fourth quarter number. Is that
kind of the right base to grow off of? Or is this more of a one-time step-up that just gets stuff accelerated or in
relative to what you'd expect to spend as you go forward to your prior comments last quarter about the flexibility
within the cost save numbers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. It's a good question. But it's a little too early for us to give you kind of a longer-term outlook. We'll do that
more fulsomely in the next quarter update when we talk in January. But I think that what you're going to see is this
elevated level of investments continuing for a few more quarters. You can't turn on a dime with this kind of stuff.
So we're going – we're ramping up toward the end of this year as we've talked about over time to capture the
opportunities that we think are present in the recovery. And that'll sustain for a few more quarters. But the key for
us is really these things drive revenue growth. We have very focused investment plan, very tied to our strategic
growth initiatives and the expectation is we'll start to see the benefits of that flowing through into accelerating
revenue growth as we go throughout 2021 and certainly into 2022.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just one, underneath that, what's also – I think Steve mentioned a bunch of this in his prepared
remarks, but like how do you go forward and help offset some of that natural inflation from the spending in terms
of things you can either see starting to become more efficient in or as Steve mentioned earlier, you'd start to
rethink some of the branch locations over time et cetera?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean you sort of ticked out our hit list there. And I think, the investments that we've got some of
which drive kind of shorter term and more productivity related benefits, others are longer term and customer
acquisition and customer relationship deepening related. And behind the scenes, we're just continuing to be
incredibly rigorous with our noninvestment expense program.
And I think the way I look at expenses is, is you've got growth investments and we maniacally drive the return out
of that and you've got the rest of the business expenses that we just squeeze perpetually lower. So, the items that
we look at are a lot of what you've just said.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Good morning. I had a question just moving to the fee side of things. There was a good rebound this quarter in
deposit service charges. And just kind of curious how you're thinking about that line item in Q4 and then kind of a
run rate starting in 2021. Obviously, given the amount of liquidity that's in consumer checking accounts that's
going to put a damper on it. But I would imagine that the spend has gotten better, so that's obviously driving some
of the improvements. So, curious how you're thinking about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. I'll take that and perhaps others may want to weigh in as well. So, we did see a bit of a
snapback in personal service charges in Q3, about $15 million higher, although it was – continues to run a fair
amount lower than last year. And as we look forward into the future, I don't expect a lot of growth in that line. I
think that the – particularly the elevated levels of deposits that we've seen, I for one believe that they're going to
be quite sticky for some time. And I guess fundamentally related, people's uncertainty about the economy, and,
therefore, just protecting themselves with ample liquidity.
And we've seen kind of a flight to quality and flight to proximity from our customers and leveraging Huntington as
a place to hold those deposits. So, I think that's going to hold personal service charges lower for a while. It's really
not our focus for growth. We're really driving the value-added fee lines over time.

Good morning, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning. So, one of your peers decided to recently exit indirect auto. Can you just talk about the economics
of that business and how the economics has changed since the beginning of the pandemic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, this is Rich. I'll take a stab at that. We love the indirect auto business. I mean this is a foundation and a core
competency that we've had for several years now. And we would grow this business as opposed to exit it. The
credit quality performs incredibly well through DFAST. It's one of our best-performing portfolios. I think if you look
at the recent deferral activity that we've had in this book and the post deferral delinquencies they're excellent and
right in line with that.
So, from a credit standpoint, we couldn't be happier with the performance of this portfolio over time. And we're
very enthusiastic about the growth of this business over time. So, we have contrarian approach and I think it's
based on the fact that we've got great dealer relationships we've built up over the years and that has proven out
very well. So, Zach, do you want to touch on...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
I'll just touch on – I'll just tack on. And I think I totally agree with everything Rich has said. This business has
incredible risk adjusted returns. To give you a sense of the yields we're seeing right now, our new volume coming
in are 3.5%. So, that's sort of constructive and helpful for the NIM trajectory. It's also relatively short lived assets.
So, it helps us continue to play as rates potentially move higher over the longer term.
And lastly I would say is just it's great to see these business lines that Huntington has that are – we've got such a
diversification of the business lines we've got that when something else is weak like commercial that we talked
about, this other one has been really a real source of strength and growth for us. So, yeah, couldn't say enough
about how much we like it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. And then just the second question, you guys talked about seeing growth in commercial later this
year. I think you referenced it a few times. Just to be clear, is this specifically a Huntington-specific-like issue that
you're growing C&I or is this – or do you envision the broader industry also growing C&I off a low base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We haven't – we're not in a position to comment on the industry, but we're looking at our pipeline what we're
making and sharing that comment, Ken. We have a pipeline today that's comparable to last year and – in both
18

business banking and our commercial banking teams. And typically fourth quarter is one of our best quarters
year-in/year-out. I would expect based on the weighting of that pipeline probability of closing to have pretty good
fourth quarter. And all indications are positive.
What we're hearing from customers is a continuing recovery. Remember, the Midwest is recovering nicely,
particularly the manufacturing sector. The biggest issue we hear in that regard is they just can't get enough
employees. Our [indiscernible] (00:50:51) numbers for the Midwest are higher than any other region of the
country, so this is a labor issue that's constraining some of the potential on the investment side and maybe
holding back some of the loan demand. So we're actually reasonably bullish about our fourth quarter and beyond.

Just back on the loan growth topic. On the commercial side, I appreciate the color you just gave in terms of in
your markets and some of the trends. Outside of dealer services from an industry perspective, where are you
seeing the improving growth dynamics? Is it manufacturing like you just said? Is that where you're starting to see
demand, or is that you're just optimistic of that materializing? Are there other portfolios where you are seeing
some momentum begin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We're clearly seeing at the manufacturing sector, John, as I mentioned. But it's more broadly based. There is a
level of business activity that's occurring on the buyout side, on the generational transfers. Beyond that, there's
activity that we're – remember, we're a principally a lower middle market bank in the commercial side. And as
inventories are getting replenished and revenues rebuilt, there's working capital demand. We do a lot of
equipment finance and asset-based lending as well. You've seen, particularly on the asset-based side, good
demand. Fourth quarter is generally good for equipment finance. Our healthcare activity is very, very strong as
well. So it's broad-based.

Zachary J. Wasserman A

I will just tack on – this is Zach. As an indication of that, the pipelines are up to almost the level of last year, just to
give you a sense off of considerably lower, including during COVID-19. And production during the quarter or
during Q3 ramped quite substantially.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. Got it. No, that's helpful. Thanks for that added color there. And then on the credit side, just to confirm, did
you indicate that your criticized assets are down? Did you say 12% in the quarter? And also, can you just talk
about what areas that you saw improvement? And if you think that decline to continue or do you think there's
going to be some pressure to the upside as some of the pressure on borrowers as they come off of forbearance
and uncertainty on stimulus weighs in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, 12% was right. It was about $425 million was the reduction over the quarter. It was very widespread. We
did have the oil and gas sales, which was about $125 million or $127 million. All of that – just about all of that was
criticized. But beyond that, it was very broad-based across just about all of our lines of business which was
heartening to see. We did do that very comprehensive review in the second quarter, which caused the spike in crit
in Q2. And so, seeing it come down in Q3, we expected that to some extent.
And I would say that we will continue to see a downward trend in criticized. It may be a bit bumpy. Quarter-to-
quarter, things will move in and things will move out within different portfolios. I think that's just the kind of the
COVID-19 environment that we're dealing and things are going to pop-up that might be somewhat unexpected.
But I would generally expect our credit quality to begin migrating – the crit/class to migrating down over time.

...following up on your auto segment comments, it looks like you guys had recently been seeing a growing mix of
used car originations, but we saw a mix shift back to new this quarter. I think that was on slide 44. Can you
discuss some of the dynamics there and give us a sense of the relative profitability of new versus used just at a
high level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I think – this is Zach, I'll start off and I don't know, maybe Mark you just may want to tack on – the yield
number is right in front of me. But I think generally, this is really influenced by the supply dynamics that Rich was
talking about earlier. So earlier in the year, when the supply interruptions we had on the original equipment side,
just demand naturally shifted to the used side and so we saw that mix change. And I think what you're seeing now
is a gradual normalization back to a kind of a longer-term typical mix of new versus used cars. The yield on used
is a bit higher than new, but I don't have the numbers right in front of me to comment more specifically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Muth A
Director-Investor Relations, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, Bill. I don't have the specific breakout on the yields between new and used, but used is always quite a bit
higher than new. And so on a risk adjusted return basis, it's actually slightly better than the new.

as we noted a lot of others.
But I think what we're seeing – our strategy is to really deepen the penetration and provide terrific products and
experiences to this segment, particularly through the digital investments we're making and we're really seeing it
work, there's a tremendous demand coming through I think partly leveraging the real success we had with PPP.
And so, it's pretty broad-based. I don't know, Rich, if you want to tack on in terms how we're thinking about?

SBA within small business as a continued lever for growth. We obviously have a core competency in SBA. We'll
continue to leverage that going forward. But also on the conventional side of business banking, which is the non-
SBA piece of it, we've seen very good growth as well. And that's been pretty widespread across industries,
healthcare and others.

Thanks, Rich. If I could squeeze one last one in for Steve. You guys have done a lot to improve the HBAN's
ROTCE profile since the Great Recession. Can you discuss your expectations for the kind of ROTCE generation
that we can expect from HBAN to the extent that SERP were to persist for an extended period?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, we haven't changed our long-term metrics on ROTCE. At this point, we'll be out as Zach mentioned with an
outlook for next year in January. So, I think that's fair to use based on the work that we've done looking forward
over the next couple of years as a rough guideline now.

Janet Lee Q

Good morning. My first question is on margin. Obviously, lots of moving pieces there. But if I put it all together,
with excess liquidity remaining elevated near-term and success of repricing looking into 2021, is the direction of
NIM modest downward trend from here or do you think you can manage it more stable given hedges benefit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Good question. Thank you. This is Zach. I'll take that one. So, I think 2020 will likely land around 300 basis
points from just a tick higher. And our expectation for 2021 excluding PPP for a second is just a few ticks higher
than that. So, about flat and my baseline outlook is a few basis points higher. We'll have – I think I mentioned
earlier kind of the next few years' hedge benefits in basis points this year was 22 basis points. Next year is 25
basis points [indiscernible] (01:00:02) forecast. That's about 3 basis points better. Interest bearing liabilities, I
expect to be down also kind of over around or over 30 basis points. We do expect yield pressure largely offsetting
that.

So that's the sort of flat to a few basis points higher outlook I've got for 2021 at this point. Again, we'll clearly do a
fair amount of work around this and we'll come back with more clear guidance later. There are wildcards and it's
the PPP timing that I mentioned. There's potentially also some – we continue to look at hedging in the portfolio.
And that could also throw a few basis points volatility in there. But generally that's my outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's very helpful. And my next question is on operating leverage. So, when we combined with expense savings
from the branch consolidations and I guess more bullish outlook on loans going into 4Q, do you see it increasingly
likely that Huntington can achieve positive operating leverage in 2021 again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No. it's really too early for us to talk about the totality of the full year of 2021. I do expect a lot of the trends that
we're seeing right now to kind of continue for the next few quarters just giving the momentum and the trends – the
businesses that we're seeing right now. And so we'll see. We'll come back and talk more about that. Our
commitment around positive operating leverage is a long-term one and we think it's the right one for the company.
But we're really focused on making the investments now to drive revenue acceleration. And I'd tell you, we feel
pretty good about it. So, we'll come back and talk more in a few months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
This is Steve. We're bullish about coming out of this cycle and taking advantage of it. That has been our
orientation in the past and we're continuing with that. So we'll be looking to drive growth – revenue growth and
you're getting a sense of that off of third quarter earnings.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Just in terms of lost content and the cadence of net charge-offs going forward. One, I guess how are you
feeling about lost content now versus say April? I'm assuming that's better, but I wanted to ask. And then two, as
you look at charge-offs and they've been relatively stable here, is there a bit of a catch up, in other words an
increase from here that we should continue to be aware of? Or are you anticipating that we can kind of hold at this
– more at this level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Brock, this is Steve. Just to your April comments, [indiscernible] (01:02:54) different, right? Think about the
volatility uncertainty in that period of time versus today. So, you should be inferring that off the comments about
the economy and the recovery et cetera. And that would be true with an expectation that credit quality will mirror
the economic recovery. There's still uncertainty and as Rich said, it may be lumpy, but we don't have a catch-up
quarter. We've already caught up.
So, we're in good shape as of the end of the third quarter given the volatility, and expect that the team will
manage with consistency as we go forward. Maybe a little lumpy because of the recovery and the nature of it, the
virus, but like the footing we have, very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. The mix optimization, could you look to move some of those Fed deposits into investment securities
or is that not something you're looking at?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, this is Zach. It's really not something we're looking at, at this time. We do expect to begin to reinvest
our securities cash flows this quarter as we've talked about a little bit over the last few calls and to get back in the
securities portfolio to around Q1 levels. So that's about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion of incremental securities
investments in the fourth quarter, but not really with a mind toward utilizing those deposits. Rather, we're focused
on deploying those for core organic growth and to some degree as a funding optimization opportunity that I
mentioned earlier. So that's the plan.

Brock Vandervliet Q

Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So thank you for the questions and your interest in Huntington. We're very pleased with the third quarter
performance and we continue to be optimistic about our future and the economic recovery. But acknowledge
volatility, uncertainty remain in the economy.
Our disciplined enterprise risk management provides a strong fundamental foundation and you're seeing that in
our numbers. We're executing our strategies and we'll continue to capitalize on opportunities. We're investing,
investing in strategic growth initiatives, while continuing to deliver solid performance.
I'm confident of our ability to manage the challenges we face and excited about our future. And finally, as I am
fond of reminding you, we are closely aligned with the interests of the board executive management and
colleagues with the other owners of the company via mechanisms such as our hold to retirement equity
requirements. And we've collectively been one of the 10 largest shareholders of the company for the past five
years. So we feel the pain and we're looking forward to a better day ahead.
Thank you again for your support and interest in Huntington. Have a great day.
