Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Diana. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported solid results. Revenue,
pre-tax, pre-provision profitability, efficiency and earnings all improved from a year ago. Second quarter 2023 net
income of $312 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.20, were both up 21% from the prior year period.
For the second quarter, both deposits and loans grew 7% linked-quarter annualized to $55.7 billion for deposits
and $49.8 billion for loans. A hallmark for East West has been our consistent financial performance throughout
various interest rate and market cycles, while maintaining high capital ratios. Our profitability and return levels
continue to be industry-leading.
For the second quarter, we returned 1.85% on average assets and 21% on average tangible common equity. Net
interest margin of 3.55%, although down from the first quarter was a healthy margin in the current environment,
and asset quality continued to be outstanding with net charge-offs of 6 basis points annualized.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, total loans reached a record $49.8 billion,
an increase of $906 million or 7% annualized from March 31. Second quarter average loan growth was 6%
annualized from first quarter. Growth in the average residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans was
partially offset in average commercial and industrial loans. Total deposits were $55.7 billion as of June 30, 2023,
an increase of $921 million or 7% annualized from March 31. Second quarter average deposit were up from the
year-ago quarter, but down $669 million or 5% annualized from the first quarter.
During the second quarter, growth in average interest-bearing checking and time deposit were offset by decline in
other deposit categories, which reflect customers seeking higher yields in a rising interest rate environment. Our
deposit book is well-diversified by deposit type and 30% of total deposit were in non-interest-bearing demand
deposit as of June 30 and our loan-to-deposit ratio was 90%.
Turning to slide 5, as shown on this slide, all of our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter due to the
strength of our earnings. East West capital ratios continued to be among the highest for regional banks. Also on
this slide, our pro forma capital calculation as of June 30. The key takeaway is that our capital is very strong. The
pro forma capital ratios, adjusting for investment security marks and the allowance for loan losses not already
included showed very solid capital ratios. Including these items, tangible common equity improved to 9.37% as of
June 30.
Quarter-over-quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 3%. East West board of directors have
declared third quarter 2023 dividends for the company's common stock. The quarterly common dividend of $0.48
per share will be payable on August 15, 2023 to stockholders of record on August 1, 2023.
Moving on to a discussion about loan portfolio beginning with slide 6. As of June 30, 2023, C&I loans outstanding
were $15.7 billion, up by $28 million or 1% annualized from the prior quarter end and up 2% year-over-year. As
shown on this slide, our C&I portfolio continues to be well diversified by industry and sector. Greater China loans
decreased 11% linked quarter annualized to $2.1 billion as of June 30.

Slide 7 and 8 show the details about commercial real estate portfolio, which is well-diversified by geography and
property type. Further, we have a seasoned customer base and a low LTV CRE portfolio. The average loan to
value for our commercial real estate portfolio is 51%. Also, we typically originate amortized loans with a final
maturity of 7 to 10 years. As of June 30, only 3% of the income-producing CRE portfolio matures in the second
half of 2023, and another 7% only matures in 2024.
Total commercial real estate loans were $19.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 up 10% annualized from March 31, and
up 7.5% year-over-year.
Credit quality for our loan portfolio remains very soft. Criticized CRE loans to total CRE loans decreased from
2.4% as of March 31, to 1.8% as of June 30, due to upgrade for loans with improved cash flows and loan payoff.
We remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risk. Given the attention on CRE, we have provided more
details about our office and retail commercial real estate loans on slide 9 and 10.
As you can see on slide 9, our office commercial real estate portfolio is very granular with few large loans. We
have only six loans that are greater than $30 million in size, which is only 11% of our office CRE loans. The
weighted average loan-to-value of our office CRE portfolio is a low 52%, and the loan-to-value is consistently low
across the different loan size segments. The portfolio is well-diversified by geography, with limited exposure to the
downtowns [indiscernible] (00:09:17) central business district in the office markets we primarily lend in.
On slide 10, you can see that our retail commercial real estate portfolio is also very granular with few large loans,
with only eight loans that are greater than $30 million in size, which is only 7% of our retail CRE loans. The
weighted average loan-to-value of our retail CRE portfolio is a low 48%. And the loan-to-value is also consistently
low across different loan size segments. The portfolio is well-diversified by geography and the footprint largely
reflects our branch network.
In slide 11, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single-family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Our residential mortgage loans are primarily originated through our
branch network. I would like to highlight that 81% of our HELOC were in first lien positions as of June 30, 2023.
Residential mortgage loans totaled $14.2 billion as of June 30, up 12% linked quarter annualized and up 13%
year-over-year.
Slide 12 breaks out our deposit mix by segment and further by industry for commercial deposits. Our deposits
totaled $55.7 billion as of June 30, 2023, an increase of 7% linked quarter annualized and 2% year-over-year. We
have over 570,000 deposit accounts at East West as of June 30, and our average commercial deposit account
size is approximately $366,000. Our retail branch base consumer deposit totaled 32% of our deposits and have
an average size of approximately $38,000. Our commercial deposit are well-diversified by industry. We do not
have significant depositors or sectors concentration.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement.

Thank you, Dominic, and good morning to all on the call.
Turning to slide 13, the asset quality of our portfolio remains strong. During the second quarter, we recorded net
charge-offs of $7.5 million or 6 basis points, a modest increase from net charge-offs of 1 basis point in the first

quarter. The increase primarily came from higher C&I gross charge-offs, partially offset by higher recoveries.
Quarter-over-quarter, criticized loans improved 11%, and the criticized loans ratio improved 24 basis points.
Nonperforming assets as of June 30 increased modestly to 17 basis points of total assets from 14 basis points as
of March 31. Reflecting loan growth, our stable asset quality metrics and the current macroeconomic outlook, we
recorded a provision for credit losses of $26 million in the second quarter compared with $20 million for the first
quarter, increasing the allowance for loan losses to $128 million.
And now, starting the discussion of our income statement on slide 14. On this slide, we detailed out specifics on
the tax credit investments as the amortization and effective tax rate can fluctuate quarter over quarter, reflecting
the timing of when tax credit investments closed. We currently anticipate that for the third quarter, the amortization
of tax credit investments will be approximately $40 million, and for the full year of 2023, the effective tax rate will
be approximately 20%.
Turning to slide 15. Second quarter 2023 net interest income was $567 million, a decrease of 5.5% from the first
quarter. Net interest margin of 3.55% compressed by 41 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you can see from
the waterfall chart on the slide, this was largely due to the impact of higher interest-bearing deposit costs and the
deposit mix shift, partially offset by expanding asset yield.
Turning to slide 16, the second quarter average loan yield was 6.33%, an increase of 90 basis points quarter-
over-quarter. As of June 30, 2023, the spot coupon rate of our loans was 6.45%, compared with 6.21% as of
March 31. In this slide, we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five
quarters. In total, 61% of our loan portfolio was variable rate as of June 30, including 27% linked to prime rate and
28% linked to SOFR.
Over the last several years, while rates were low, we continue to help many of our CRE and C&I customers, to a
lesser extent, hedge against rising rates through the use of swaps, caps and collars. Fixed rate and synthetically
fixed rate loans are 65% of the total CRE book as of June 30. These clients are protected against the rising debt
service costs in a higher rate environment.
Turning to slide 17. Our average cost of deposits for the second quarter was 212 basis points, up 52 basis points
from the first quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 228 basis points as of June 30, equivalent to a 44%
cumulative beta relative to the 500-basis-point increase in the target Fed funds rate since December 31, 2021. In
comparison, the cumulative beta on our loans has been 60% over the same time period.
Moving on to fee income on slide 18. Total noninterest income in the second quarter was $79 million. Fee income
was $69 million, reflecting growth across all fee income categories during the quarter. For the second quarter,
other investment income of $4 million was up $2 million from the first quarter, largely reflecting higher income
from Community Reinvestment Act investments.
Moving to slide 19, second quarter noninterest expense was $262 million. Excluding the amortization of tax
credits and CDI, adjusted noninterest expense was $205 million in the second quarter, up a modest 1%
sequentially. Second quarter compensation and employee benefits expense was lower by $5 million, due to
higher seasonal costs in the first quarter. The second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 31.8%, compared with
30.5% in the first quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income was $440 million in the second quarter, and
our pre-tax pre-provision ROA was industry-leading 2.61%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
And with that, I will now review our updated outlook for the full year of 2023 on slide 20. For the full year 2023
compared to our full year 2020 results, we expect year-over-year loan book in the range of 5% to 7%, unchanged
from the prior outlook. Year-over-year net interest income growth in the range of 12% to 15%, underpinning our
net interest income assumptions is the forward interest rate curve as of June 30th, which assumes one Fed funds
rate hike of 25 basis points in October with a year-end Fed funds target rate of 5.50%. Adjusted noninterest
expense growth in the range of 9% to 11%, we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive
operating leverage year-over-year.
In terms of credit, for the full year of 2023, we currently expect to report a provision for credit losses in the range
of $110 million to $130 million. The provision for credit losses for 2023 will be largely driven by loan growth and
changes in the macroeconomic outlook. Today, asset quality is excellent, and we believe the potential losses from
any problem loans are limited and very manageable.
Finally, we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 20% based on approximately
$150 million of tax credit investments, excluding [indiscernible] (00:17:59) investment and an estimated related
tax credit amortization of $145 million for the full year.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Dominic for closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene. In closing, we are pleased with our consistent financial performance and strong core earnings.
Although net interest income decreased given the deposit competition, our revenue and pre-tax, pre-provision
profitability remained very strong. The East West business model is resilient and diversified and our balance
sheet is healthy. We operate with high capital levels and we are well-positioned to deliver earnings growth and
strong profitability.
I will now open the call to questions. Operator.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will
come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, my first question, Irene, for you on NII. So it was a decent step down in the second quarter. If I have it
right, your guidance implies that NII stabilizes about 5.65% per quarter in the back half of the year. One, give us
your assumptions around terminal deposit betas, NIB mix underpinning the NII guide and what leads NII to being
at the lower end of your guide at 12% versus 15%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. First of all, when we look at where we stand today, what's positive, although with the
deposit competition, the cost of deposits did increase in the second quarter. What's positive, as we keep growing,
we're bringing on new customer deposits. And through that, we have the opportunity to lay off some of these
higher cost broker deposits that we placed on the balance sheet after the mid-March disruption. And I'll just share,
since June 30, we've laid off about a little over $600 million at 5.15% and replace that with lower cost customer
deposits.
So the momentum is here and that is one of the underpinning drivers for why we think NII will stabilize. Of course,
the expectation is that the Fed will increase rates next week. That will help a little bit on the yield side as well and
[indiscernible] (00:21:01) around the guidance, I do think a lot of that is going to be how successful we are. As I
mentioned, we're positive and the momentum is there on the deposit side but how successful we are in growing
those customer deposits over the course of the year. And then, of course, also a little bit as far as the range of
where we'll be on the loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And where do you expect the NIB balances to stabilize, Irene?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So right now my expectation is from the level that we were at, at June 30, it will decrease a little bit. I'll
share that also quarter-to-date has been positive and we're at 31% as of yesterday.

Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
DDA.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
DDA, I'm sorry. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So, I mean, just to clarify, so as of June 30, DDA was 30%. I mean, as of two days ago, it's now 31%. And just
another perspective is that the spot rate for deposit as of June 30 is 2.28% and then as two days ago, 2.27%. So
we actually are maintaining the deposit rate pretty steady.
And quite frankly, if you look at even – well, if we reflect back even in May and June, the deposit rate relatively
was very stable around closer to 2.28%. And the fact is it was just the Silicon Valley Bank and situation in large
which caused a spike in April. And to a certain extent, we try and do it on our own, too, because we want to be
extraordinarily cautious and prudent, and we did not need that much deposit to come in. We have very good loan
to deposit ratio. We could have just let some of the deposit outflow and not worrying about showing up deposit but
we did. We actually brought in broker deposits and so forth.
So once we saw it stabilize after April, so we now decided that we can just ease it up because the momentum of
new customer deposit, existing customer deposit and whatnot, all together give us some confidence that things
are stabilizing and we can move forward and by replacing the higher cost institutional money to retail and
commercial clients deposit. And we think that with that, we should be able to in a much more stabilized situation
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And if I may, Dominic, one more just around capital. So you have a lot of excess capital. A lot of your peer
banks have reported and are building capital, exiting certain lending businesses. Talk to us in terms of just given
where we are, how are you looking at market share growth opportunities? Are you leaning in or is the macro way
too uncertain to look for growth opportunities right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think that you just said it kind of like answer my question with your question. The macro economic situation, it is
uncertain. It is uncertain. I mean, anyone said that they know exactly what's going on in the future is kidding
themselves, right. We really don't know. I mean, I thought that the recession should have been here actually. With
the rate spike like that, I thought the recession have already arrived by now, it didn't. So it may turn out to be a
soft landing. [indiscernible] (00:24:56), but it may not.
So the economic environment's certainly not something that we can bet on. But, in the meantime, the market
environment has never been as ideal as it is today. When I say market environment is that for decades, we've
been competing with some very competitive neighborhood bankers out there. And they are good as – some of
them good at venture capital PE, some of them good at making very high net worth customers, mortgages, and
quite frankly, for price, for whatever reason, we decided not be able to compete. Today, they're gone.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
So we have just so much less competition. And with our size, I was sort of like being able to continue to have
senior management engagement with clients. We're in a very good sweet spot. From a market perspective, I
never seen East West to be in better position than we are today but the macroeconomic environment is certainly
not clear. And then you reflect back on another perspective, which is, well, if I'm making 21% return on equity,
why do I want to go crazy right now to try and do all kinds of stuff?
So we are watching the market. We're taking advantage of one customer at a time. When there's some other
customer from other bank who wanted to explore relationship with us, we are welcoming them. But we are doing it
prudently, not trying to go out there and then in order to make some kind of earnings then that we have to go out
there and make a big group of hirings here and there and then so forth. That's not necessary because we like
where we are right now. We have a very diversified loan portfolio, very diversified deposit portfolio, and that's
good. And if there is any good prospect coming in, we certainly will entertain, and – but we'll make sure that we
stay disciplined with our East West Bank credit metrics and pricing metrics.
And that's what we are. We still feel that there is opportunity to grow. I'm not that certain about in the next two
quarters how much opportunity that is, but I'm 100% sure in the next two or three years it's going to be really
good.

Just maybe sticking on with the capital theme. As we go into year end with the broker deposits running down and
the BTFP likely to be paid off and certain cash goes down, that capital will continue to grow. How high is too high
for capital? What else can we expect the capital management to payout ratio with only 22% here?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think how high is too high is based on, again, the macroeconomic environment. The way I see it is that we do a
lot of these volatility comparison that is that, well, if we – I mean, many banks are buying stock because they can
generate the kind of EPS or return that is required and then that's what they need to – what we need to do. We –
obviously, today, with the capital ratio, we still have industry-leading ROE. So, therefore, this is [indiscernible]
(00:28:55) something that we have to urgently do for our shareholders in light of we also have dividend increase
year-after-year, right.
So, from that standpoint, but we are shareholders friendly. So, when we think that we come to a point, it is capital
ratio getting too high. There is really not much risk in the horizon in the market – no – in terms of – in the
economic outlook. And then we, for whatever reason, feel that there's so much earnings, it's just not going to be
possible for enough growth, we absolutely would consider that buyback scenario. We've done that. We've done
that before and we would do it again.
But in this kind of uncertain economic environment where we don't know whether there will be recession coming
or how aggressive the Fed wants to keep the rate high, for how long that may cause a major downward spiral on
the economic condition that affects, so on industries and so forth, this may create a much better opportunity for
potential acquisitions or anything that is available out in the market and we don't want to spend the money on
buyback and not having excess capital, just like for much better opportunity because after all, we don't run our
bank as a quarter-to-quarter kind of basis.
We run our bank on a long-term sustainability basis. For the last three quarters, I've been here, we always looked
at year-after-year of record earnings and year-after-year of [indiscernible] (00:30:48) we want to be able to do
that. And so to do that, we constantly have to make investment. And just like even in challenging deposit
environment like the last quarter, we're still investing in our infrastructure. We're still investing in our enterprise
risk management platform to make sure that we continue to have the ability to sustain the long-term growth like
the way we have done for the past decades.
So very simple. Actually, we have very simple kind of strategy, and then it's just like whatever makes sense. If it
makes sense, we'll do all the right thing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And I guess just want to follow up, looking at the single-family residential, great growth there. What
are some of the dynamics driving that? Are you still seeing strong immigration coming in? Is it additional capital
coming into the country, or is this just the existing customer base and maybe the existing potential customer base
that's already in the US doing more?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It's a combination. There's always immigrants coming to US. The fact is we just become bigger and our brand's
stronger. Our branch network is all over the place and then people recognize the brand. And so more and more of
the customer in the Asian-American community that from our retail branch banking footprint coming to East West
Bank because they know that they can get East West to make a decision to approve credit in a timely manner, will
close the loans, also fund the loans on a timely manner as both from services and – that are broad outreach
within the branch footprint, allow us to continue to have a very strong momentum so far.

Again, this also surprised me a little bit. I would expect that with the rate rising like that, people are not buying
homes, but I guess people are still buying homes. It's not just, by the way, just as particularly different at East
West. In fact, throughout the country, we see the statistics from this economic report that people are still buying
homes. So we're just getting the fair share of the benefits.

On NIM – good morning. On the margin, you mentioned the rate hike coming up would be helpful. I was just
curious how much of a lift you guys expect to get from that in the margin? And just to reiterate, you're not
assuming a hike in July. You have an October hike in your guidance so this July hike would obviously be a better
situation right off the bat versus your guidance here, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's right. That's correct. I think just to clarify, our guidance is based on the forward curve as of June 30.

David Rochester Q

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Certainly, I think market expectations moved a little bit since then. The lift from the rate – let me get you that
number. I don't see – I don't have it in front of me, Dave, but certainly it helps given the variable rate loans that we
have. I'll also say that rate hikes or not, given the current environment, I think we're being conservative on the
kind of deposit beta assumption with the expectation that even if rates do not increase from this point in time, they
may stay elevated for a period of time before rates decrease.
So that's also underpinning our kind of NII and NIM guidance. I'd also share kind of in continuation of my
comments earlier, so about – we laid off about $600 million or so quarter-to-date. Our plan is about $1.7 billion

over the course of the second half of the year. And with the pipelines and what we're seeing on the deposit front,
we think that's very achievable as far as $1.75 billion of broker or higher cost deposit that will run off.

Irene H. Oh A

That's included, but we're modeling around the range around that. How about that, Dave?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's great. And my follow-up on the expense guide, it would just be great if you could talk
about the drivers for the increase in that versus your prior guide, and if you see any potential cost save
opportunities that you guys could pursue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. I think when we look at the expense guidance and also the increase from our prior
guidance, a couple of things. One, year-to-date, the actual results and the expenses that we've incurred thus far,
when we look at the remainder of the year and kind of just the sentiment around things, certainly things are a lot
different than they were at the start and mid-April. That's certainly part of the reflection on what are the expenses,
what are the investments that we need to do to sustain the growth. As Dominic talked about, we are continuing to
see opportunities to grow frontline, back office, also from the risk management perspective.
So those are the real drivers around that. Nothing really unusual on the chart. But we are hiring, head count is
over. It is up year-over-year. And I think drivers to reduce, certainly, I think the environment changes. Now, there
are some levers there as well, but I think at this point in time, we don't expect that, Dave.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of new customer gains in your footprint on both the
loan and the deposit side, especially given the strong growth that you're seeing on in resi. Are there any gains in
business that you're getting from either legacy Silicon Valley Bank or First Republic customers in your footprint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are getting some. We are not – I mean, like I said, we are not like aggressively pursuing like HSBC, bring the
whole team over, that kind of things, or a bunch of people going to JPMorgan. We are very selective. And
obviously, what happened to those institutions, there are a lot of bankers seeking new homes. So, I mean, with us
being in California, without a doubt, there are many inquiries coming to us.
And so we just find the right people with the right cultural fit, with the right type of mindset that fit into what we – in
our model and then, we bring them on. And then same thing for customers. We have – I personally have more
inquiries from our clients referring to friends who were customers or who still are customers for these failed banks
and they're just looking for a new home.
So we're very busy in discussion with many of those. And we – some of those loans booked. I mean, if you look at
C&I, you noticed that commitment gone up 15% but outstanding balance gone up 1%. We took a lot of
commitment, but it's going to take a little while to do the drawdown and same thing for deposits. We opened lot of
accounts but it takes a little while to start getting them operating and start getting deposit flowing. And we're not
trying to hurry up in doing that because, again, it's not like that we have one quarter or two quarter or three
quarters finish line and then we're done. We're running a long-term business.
And so we just gradually start taking on these new clients, making sure that they get the right experience. And
then we also don't want it to get overwhelmed with a surge of these inquiries and ending up neglecting our
existing customers. So – and then in addition to that, we also wanted to continue our journey of further enhancing
and upgrading our whole enterprise risk management. And so these work cannot be sort of like put aside just
because there are inquiries from customers from these failed banks and have wanted to migrate over and then
we stop taking care of all the other fundamental business that we need to take care of.
So all-in-all, we just like doing all of that in the same time. And I would expect a gradual – slowly, gradually, we'll
get more of these customers not only from the failed banks, by the way, some of these other regional banks or –
that also have some sort of challenges. That also have their customers going to be start looking at East West
because many of these clients are going to be looking at who are the banks have a high likelihood. They don't
have to worry much about the future.
And banks have very high capital ratio and, year in, year out, always put out strong numbers and don't always get
in and out of jail with the regulators. They are the one that in general are going to be well sought after. So
therefore we want to keep it that way. So we don't want to go crazy, I mean, and get all excited about this
opportunity and then get ourselves back in jail or something like that. That wouldn't be good, right? So that's what
we're.

[indiscernible] (00:41:45). Thanks for that. And I guess related to that, in terms of investing in the business. I
mean, I know you moved your expense guide up slightly. Can you talk about what's driving that revision? Is it
mainly investment spend? Is it some opportunity you're seeing in this environment? And then how we should think
about just expenses overall even going into next year as maybe you continue to invest in the business, but also
as I guess the bank industry as a whole, sees more of an impact from regulation, if there's anything else you need
to do there, given your asset size?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we are less than $100 billion and far less than $100 billion. We are $68 billion to be exact. And so therefore,
this is around two-third, just above two-third of that threshold. So right now, looking at organic growth, it's going to
take a while to get to that $100 billion. Also, if you think about it, even if we're $100 billion, we always do whatever
we need to do to make sure that we are above and beyond the minimal requirement that required from the
regulators. And so with our capital ratio, it's really not much an issue at all because you look at a lot other banks
are really struggling with the potential new regulatory proposal because the capital ratio is low.
And then once they start adding here one items here and there and then next thing, they may not meet the
threshold. We are way above it. So one way or the other, it doesn't make any difference. But I wanted to keep
reminding folks on the call that we're actually only two-thirds the size. So we're not quantifying to worry.
But in the meantime, getting back to the increase – slight increase of guidance of the expenses, as Irene
mentioned earlier that as of April – in the mid-April when we start putting into guidance after the first quarter
earnings, in the midst of the Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic kind of situation, we didn't
expect there's much opportunity to grow at that point because we expected there'll be probably a recession
coming, right? So that's going to drop rate and all of that didn't happen.
So in fact, not only it didn't happen, and [indiscernible] (00:44:25) we saw that our deposit also kind of stabilized a
little bit and the customer demand got much higher rate. It was very much so in March and April but by May or so,
it somewhat subsided. And in addition to that, those inquiries from customers of these banks that got into trouble
start coming because once it stabilized, they start looking at that, well, maybe some of the new parents that apply
those [indiscernible] (00:45:00) are not the right set and they start talking to us. When we start looking at all of
that, we feel that it is appropriate to start hiring some of the talented bankers. And it is appropriate that we
continue to stay vigilant to invest whatever we need to invest. We're not over investing. We never over invest.
East West always invest incrementally from a technology, from operation infrastructure and in terms of hiring. But
we are absolutely out there looking at talents to see whether they fit into our culture and bring them on.
We do not get way over concerned about, whoa, would that affect 1% or 2% of our expenses and then therefore
we should wait. Sometimes you wait, you don't get them. And – but why we feel comfortable about doing all that is
because we still have positive operating leverage today. So one way or the other, we're still making more money
because that revenue growth is still going to be bigger than the expense growth. So we feel very confident that
this is the right thing to do in light of what our very high return of equity ratio compared with the industry. Let's just
continue to keep doing what's right, what's good for the bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. It sounds like the – it's – the expanse and the investment spend is coming more from a growth mindset
rather than anything that regulators might even ask banks well below $100 billion to do. So I appreciate that.
Thank you.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Yes. So I noticed criticized loans had declined quarter-over-quarter and it stands out amongst your peers
[indiscernible] (00:47:12) the opposite effect. So if you could please elaborate on to what you're seeing with your
customers that's driving that effect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, what we've seen is that we've seen nothing. That's the scary part. Well, actually, we do regular loan-by-loan
review. That's part of East West Bank. It's been doing – we've been doing this for years and years. I've been
concerned about a potential CRE portfolio five, six years ago. And so we do loan-by-loan review and we continue
– well, I guess because of that vigilance, we do have pretty high asset quality from our portfolio. And we do the
same thing for C&I.
And we just – even with the pandemic, I thought it's going to be – I mean, we started – let's get back to earlier.
Let's start with the tariffs that we said wow, with the tariff, our trade finance portfolio is going to be getting hit hard.
Let's just review one by one. We review one by one. We manage this quite, really, really closely, monitor it very
closely. We have discussion with the clients, ask them to do what the right thing. And then in the end of day, we
didn't take any losses. And gets through that. And that becomes – tariffs becomes just a normal day-to-day
business.
And then we go into a pandemic. We thought, wow, we're going to lose a lot of money. We're taking a lot of
losses with all these hotels and strip centers shut down and tenants not paying rent in their apartments. And then
at the end of the day, we didn't take any losses.
And then when there's interest rate spike in this very, very aggressive manner, we said there's no way our clients
can pay this kind of interest rate at some point. But as of today, they're paying it and they're doing fine. Well, I
think, Brandon, it helps when we have a very loan-to-value, which give a lot more incentive for clients to stay on at
15


East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
the property. And in addition to that, our clients have a lot of liquidity and many of them have personal guarantee.
All of these characteristics help to keep this portfolio strong in the commercial real estate side.
And then, Brandon, if you – I think that as I mentioned, as part of my, sort of, like a script that we talked about
earlier, loans mature in 2023. There's only 3% of our CRE loans will be maturing for the remainder of 2023. And
then in 2024, only another 7%. So all together for the next 18 months, we will have 10% of our loans coming due.
So we just happen to have very stable portfolio that there's not a whole lot that we need to worry about. We don't
have this big high rise building in downtown that cause us – cause other banks concern. So I think is all of that
that helps.
Now, the criticized asset improves in terms of ratio. Some of that have to do, again, because we've been prudent
and conservative. These loans that we downgrade during pandemic, we wanted to give a little more time to make
sure – we could have upgraded probably six, nine months ago. I mean, because when – after the pandemic,
things getting a bit normal, some of the business getting back on track, we didn't need upgrade. We wanted to
see how they operate. Do they have a sustainable good cash flow when things are getting better, really better,
and then we upgrade that. So, to a certain degree, maybe some of this upgrade, there's a little bit of a timing
difference. It's not like suddenly, today, this credit perform even better than two months ago, three months ago
[indiscernible] (00:51:36). They just – there are some I would say that long should have been upgraded earlier,
but we took care now for just the last few months. And the other thing will be there – a couple of loans here and
there that are having some challenges. We find a way to help the clients to pay off this credit. And also help
reduce the criticized loans ratio. And all in all, that's – I think that's the reason.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Thanks. That's really great color. And then, I noticed C&I realization tick down a bit in the quarter. And I
know there have been some deleveraging from your customers, but I'm wondering just what you're seeing in the
front lines there and [indiscernible] (00:52:24) continuing towards the back half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Second half of the year. Yeah. So, C&I, I think quite candidly, with just kind of the environment right now, the
utilization did tick down a little bit, Brandon, as you mentioned. I would share, though, as we look, and to a certain
extent, there's only so much we can do with that, right? As Dominic mentioned, commitments are up. I would
share, though, when we look at the pipelines and when we talk to our team leaders, the expectation for the
second half of the year of new client acquisition is something where it is increasingly positive. That's certainly
something that we have factored in for the second half of the year.
With that said, given the current environment and I would say that we're not necessarily expecting that utilization
rate will increase substantially from this point. But I would also say no specific kind of areas or concentrations of
where that growth is coming from. It's pretty broad based.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to close the loop on the margin, Irene. Can you give us
a sense for where you think the cycle deposit beta might shake out at the end of the day? I think low 60s is what
you were previously targeting but were there on a spot basis. And then if you had the monthly NIM in June, we'll
take it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So the monthly NIM in June was the same as the month end spot of the 2.28%. Also, I'll share up until now
in July, it's been the same.
[indiscernible] (00:54:26)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's right. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Cost of deposits, not the NIM. I think the expectation for NIM is that it will
decrease modestly from the second quarter, but still NII with the drivers that we're talking about, we expected that
to flatten out and improve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then just on the media and entertainment portfolio, I know it's only 4% of loans, but can you speak to
the Hollywood shutdown and how that might impact the portfolio and what you might have in place in terms of
structure to protect yourselves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. From a credit risk perspective, we don't have any concern. But from a production like growth, volume on
loan origination point of view – well, actually, we booked a lot of entertainment content production loans. But if
there's a strike, they're not going to draw down. So we hope the strike doesn't last too long. But if it sustains for an
extended period of time, then we will have some loans that may not have the kind of drawdown that we would like
to have, and it's not going to have any credit quality issue.
So – but the beauty of this is that that's why we have a very diversified loan portfolio. And if entertainment content
production financing slowing down a little bit, some of the others just have to make it up. Or we're going to have to
get our lending officers to continue to work on this new prospective clients and get those loans funded to offset
against the slowdown in the entertainment side. But all in all, I looked at it is that it's not going to be any credit
quality issue. It's just all coming back to get outstanding balance on that particular portfolio.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I do want to mention, we – if you look at the chart, page 6, we highlight that there's 4% of our loans that are
in media and entertainment. Again, I want to highlight it's media and entertainment. So we do have also a good,
decent-sized portfolio of digital media, and they're not affected by strikes. These are the one that building
videogames and then some of the other things, they are not part of the Hollywood labor's forces. So it's very
different. So it's a combination that make up to 4%. So it's not as sizeable as what we reflected here on page 6.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Irene, I wanted to kind of revisit your comments about the plan $1.7 billion of brokered runoff back-half of the
year. I know you don't give kind of deposit growth guidance, but as we're thinking about the balance sheet, should
we be thinking of that $1.7 billion being replaced by customer deposits and then an additional growth on top of
that, basically equal plus or minus, your loan growth in the back half of the year? So is that kind of the way to
think about the rest out of the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Gary, that is the plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then the second part of that question, I guess, is the $600 million or so that you've kind of let roll off so
far in July and replaced by customer deposits. What's the incremental or the marginal cost of the new customer
18


East West Bancorp, Inc.
(EWBC) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
deposits that are coming in? It sounds like it must be pretty close to, kind of, the June 30 spot rate because it
doesn't sound like that's moved very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think the – actually that's a great question. The incremental deposits, new customers, new CISes,
that's [indiscernible] (00:59:03) there is a little bit kind of marginal increase that is happening. Some of that has
been a little bit of migration that we've seen with the higher rate environment, QCDs, especially on the consumer
side. But predominantly when we look at growth...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
The mix coming in is more CDR [indiscernible] (00:59:21)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, the consumer side and – let me clarify. I think the growth dollar wise is commercial side. But, overall,
on the consumer side, especially with CDs, that is something that continues to be a pressure on the margin in
total. But new customer acquisition, generally, that has been commercial-oriented and lower in rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks. And then I guess one more question on the kind of beta and deposit pricing. Historically, you think
of there being kind of this long or multi-quarter deposit catch up after the Fed stops raising rates. In a scenario
where a hike next week is the last one and that has some impact on the third quarter, and given the amount of
catch up we've had over the last couple of quarters that's been incredibly rapid, is your sense that fourth quarter,
that kind of delta, assuming no additional hikes after next week, moderates pretty significantly to where the lag
after the Fed – the Fed's last hike is much shorter in nature, or do you have any sense of how that might play out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, Gary, honestly, your guess is as good as mine, right, around that. But realistically, as we're kind of
modeling it out, our assumptions are that there will be a lag and the deposit costs will remain somewhat elevated
for a period of time. Now, there have been different examples relative – in the relative kind of recent history as
well. Let's say when the pandemic hit and rates changed dramatically, where we were able to go in and
dramatically lower deposit costs as well. But as we're modeling out with our guidance for the rest of the year,
we're not assuming that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. No, I'm certainly not suggesting that deposit costs go back to the other direction but more so that the lag
following the fed hike is bit shorter perhaps than it's been in the past. Okay. All right. Thanks for taking the
questions.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Yeah. At this point, I think – yeah, at this point, logically, I would expect that it would ease. I mean, if you look at
the rate spike, it affect the entire banking industry. It's because of March 8, March 9. The news of Silicon Valley
Bank that caused a dramatic change on the rate environment that it – heightened the attention for consumer and
consumer retail or commercial customers. And then everybody started looking at either moving deposit out or
asking for a higher rate.
And then so one – sort of like a one big, two to three weeks' time then just caused this big surge of interest rate.
And obviously, that has subsided dramatically. So we don't see that another 25 basis points is going to make that
much of a difference by now because the banking industries have stabilized. And I assume that the other banks
would also be a little bit more prudent in terms of not going out there and then putting out very high rate to attract
deposits.
And when that's the case, the competition ease, and no one has to really put up a higher rate. But when the
competition go crazy, and then we all have to sort of like somewhat move along in the same direction.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Just a quick one, Irene, on the margin. The quarter-on-quarter change from two cuts to one additional hike
was the reason for the [ph] TRIM (01:03:18) guide. If the forward curve plays out and we get cuts next year, can
you just make a comment or two about how you think the margin may react?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. I think, first of all, we will give guidance for 2024 in January, and that's not something that
we're planning to do today. Given the variable nature of our loan book, that is something, Chris, that we've tried to
be disciplined around and putting on swaps and hedges to preserve the net interest income and the interest
income on loans as much as possible. This year that's been tough as far as the impact of that to the interest
income on loans and also AOCI, quite frankly, but certainly I think if the rate cuts happen, that'll be something that
we were fortunate to do and partner it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Irene, I just wanted to – I know it's not a huge driver of quarterly results, but I just wanted to ask if you had any
thoughts around fee income moving forward, if you thought kind of this, I would call it probably 77 and change in
kind of core modelable items going forward, if you thought that this was a good run rate or where that would
shake out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, great question. And in fact, I think the growth rate on that has been something that has also been a great
surprise for us as far as transaction volume, notional amounts, FX volumes, consumer, commercial, the growth
that we've seen there that's been great. From the IRC swap teams, again, same thing. Volumes are increasing.
And in fact, across the board, wealth management, loan fees a little bit and even the account deposit fees have all
been up quarter-over-quarter, which is quite positive.
And I'll just share though, with the total fee income, there is also a little mark-to-market and with the kind of
movement in the tenure that played a factor as well. With that said, I think that the momentum is pretty good. I do
think that maybe this quarter, it's a little bit higher than normalized. But certainly, when we look at the rest of the
year and 2024, the pipeline looks great. We are acquiring new clients and that is something that is very positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. Could I ask just on the fixed rate loan portfolio? I know that a good chunk of it is single-family resi.
But just I guess when you look at the fixed rate loan book, what's the dollar amount that's repricing over the next
12 months and what are the current yields look like on those loans? And if you get bifurcate it, maybe between
the CRE and everything else that would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So over the next 12 months, we have approximately $800 million of fixed and hybrid fixed loan CRE and
single-family maturing or repricing. And then if you kind of break that down, it's a little different per category, but,
on average, we're talking about probably a weighted average interest of 4.75% that we expect to move up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And did you mention already what the new origination yields would look like for those loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. To clarify, some of this is on maturity and some of this is hybrids that are going to step up. So I think in the
current environment, the hybrids step up, especially for the single family. There's a cap on that. But, with that said,
if we look at the new originations, generally speaking, C&I has been about [indiscernible] (01:07:38) flat. CRE for
hybrid and variable rate, a blended, maybe a 7.4%. And single family, if you look at the current originations, it's
been about 6.5%. So as we noted, a lot of these, where price has been locked a while ago when they started –
the applicant started the process. But the current rate [indiscernible] (01:08:00) for 30-year fixed mortgage, no
points.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. And then I did want to ask, do you happen to know what the effect of duration of your AFS
portfolio is and what the conditional prepayment rate you're assuming in that duration calculation is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The effect of duration has slightly reduced quarter-over-quarter just a little bit, honestly, more of a tenor and
the change. So we're probably 3.89% right now down modestly. The CPR, I think if we look at the MBS and also
the CMBS generally, I mean, the prepayments have slowed dramatically. I can get you the specifics of that later.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then the last question that I had was just it sounds like – there's some improvement in the mix
shift in June and you've got the brokered rundown and if maybe we stabilize mix shift can kind of steady out here,
at least on the NIBs. But I guess I was hoping that maybe you could help me think about the bifurcation between
commercial clients and retail customers at this point? And how mix and beta acceleration between those
customers are may be differentiated at this point in the cycle? Because I guess my baseline thought would that
you would have gotten a lot of commercial mix and beta catchup done earlier and already. And then maybe you're
going to have more of a catchup on the retail side just because they're a little bit slower to move. I just, I was
hoping that maybe you could speak to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's a great question. I would say that probably what we have seen is that you're right, you're
exactly right. On the commercial side, it was earlier. On the consumer side, there was a lagging impact. And part
of that is the nature of the customers that we have, Brody. We have many, many customers, thousands where
their primary personal checking account is at East West. That is still as of today, as of 6/30, $4 billion of the DDA
balances are consumer checking accounts. Now in this current environment, we've had trouble growing that quite
candidly as clients and customers are moving their access liquidity to CDs.
So one of the things that we saw in the second quarter is that although there was quite a lag overall on the
consumer deposit betas up until the second quarter with this mix shift and the pivot a little bit to CDs and DDA
consumer balances remaining stable, which quite candidly, in the current environment tough to do. But
[indiscernible] (01:10:59), the betas on consumer did increase from where we were at 03/31.
And this point in time, quite honestly, if we look toward the future, I think with the growth that we continue to see
and the opportunities on the commercial side, perhaps, over time, on the commercial side, I think consumer, it will
kind of moderate, right, because, to a certain extent, if you haven't been alerted to the interest rate environment or
you're probably not going to at this point in time, so we're not seeing that continual migration as well on the
consumer side, but the commercial side is we continue to onboard new clients, I think that will help as well.

Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to
Dominic for any closing remarks.
